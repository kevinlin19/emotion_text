Absolutely Incredible: Mitch Albom is a hero in my eyes. This book was one I could not stop listening to. I purchased the cassette tape version so my mother who is legally blind could listen to it too. She loved the story also. Thanks Mitch, I will be looking out for your other books on tape so that mom and I can continue to enjoy your writings!
A good, quick read: I picked this book up from the library a couple of days ago after hearing good reviews about it. All in all I say it is a good book, worth the time it takes to read it.
Something for everyone: Set aside a couple of hours and get out some kleenex. I guarantee that at least something in this book will touch everyone deeply in some way. This was a beautiful story. I would be very happy to find heaven the way it was described here--and that the history of my own life would reveal such meaning for others, both known and unknown to me.
Very Good: I picked up this book soon after I lost a dear friend unexpectedly. I'm so glad I did. It gives an idea about what may happen to us after we leave our earthly life. It's not far-fetched or crazy, its simply a pleasure to read. I'm passing it on to my dear friend's grown granddaughter, who is having difficulty with her loss. She is anxious to read it and I think it will help her come to a place where she will not be filled with sorrow when she thinks of her 'Gran'.
Warm, thought-provoking and sensitive: I finished this book in bed, on a blustery but sunny, Saturday morning in May. When I closed the book I found myself watching the summer clouds being blown over the blue sky and contemplating Heaven...who would be me MY five people? Who would I wait for? I can't remember the last book I read that made me think for so long afterwards.A powerful, yet simple book and one I would recommend to anyone who contemplates life...or death and the way our threads of life are interwoven.
A Great Book: Don't read this book without a box of tissue around. It is well written and even though it is fiction it is a reminder that we are all important to someone... even someone we may not personally know or recall. Highly recommended.
5 People You Meet in Heaven - My favorite book ever: This is probably my favorite book ever. Mr. Albom does a wonderful job throughout the entire book. It is spirtually uplifting and kept my interest from start to finish. I highly recommend this book to all.
The 5 People...: I really enjoyed reading this book. It makes me think about if I was in Eddie's shoes who I would run into if I went to heaven. I know I am reading a good book if it makes me cry at some point for some reason, and judging by that, The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a really good book.
just an afterschool special: Well, nothing against all the positive reviews, but I really did not like this book. It had all the subtlety and nuance of an afterschool special.I mean, what a great premise: a grizzled, injured war vet with a guilty conscience and a dead-end life gets a chance to re-examine his earthly existance with the aid of five heavenly guides. Wow. Unfortunately I thought the book simply failed to deliver a good story.I found it way too sweet and pat and I really could not feel like I got to know the main character at all. Every situation was cliche, and every ending was just so pat. I kept waiting for the grand insight that would make it all worthwhile, but it never came.Instead, made-for-TV quality expositions on heaven and the meaning of life. Too bad.
Not a "Tuesdays with Morrie": "Tuesdays with Morrie" was a wonderful book. Even the TV version was enjoyable (Jack Lemmon - how could you go wrong)! This book is different; this fable is not believable and draws some strange conclusions (especially in regards to the father) to come to the predictable ending. For me, this book was a major disappointment. The reviews on Amazon are not indicative of how I believe most will feel upon completion of this book.My sister, who anxiously wanted to read this book after some talk show endorsement, was sadly disappointed as well. She has not read "Tuesdays" and is not eager to do so after reading this book. That is too bad.I suggest going to the store and trying to read a few chapters before buying it. I kept saying that is has to get better than this. Unfortunately it did not. My suggestion is to read "Tuesdays with Morrie" instead and pretend that this book does not exist. The idea of the book was a good one, but the execution of this idea is another story.
Victor: The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a book that I enjoyed reading very very much. The book follows Eddie, and 83-year-old mechanic who works at a theme park. One day a new ride that takes people up a tower and then drops them before slowing to a stop breaks. Eddie saves a girl from being crushed but in the process he dies. He is met in heaven one by one by five people who tell how eddie affected or was effected in their life. The book overflows with emotional chapters and twists that perplex the reader to read forward and explains many things that happen earlier on in the book. This to me was a great read and I strongly recomend it to anyone to read.Mitch Albom is a fantastic author in my eyes just because of how good of a job he did on that book.
Wonderful read for those looking for a respite from real lif: This book will leave you feeling one thing for sure, every person you come in contact with throughout your life, has a purpose. The old cliche of "everything happens for a reason" is apparent in this book. You may not know who you touch for a very long time, as Eddie finds out in this story.No, it is not the greatest book I have ever read, however, it is a nice escape from this real world full of such terrible things. QUICK to read, even for those with "no time" at all.
what life is all about: a tale of anamolous convention that molests the notion of unequivical sanctimonious congruity, but does so with a passion that nearly eclipses that wondrous and loving book titled "what life is all about" by MO. both, though entirely different, reach and strike at the heart of the human condition. if you don't own both correct your err now.
Pleased Everyone: I bought ten copies of this book and gave them as gifts. A wonderful thing to share and spread around. Thank You Mitch Albom!
Not anything like Tuesdays with Morie: I think Mitch had a great deal of pressure on him after writing "Tuesdays with Morie". He had quite an act to follow and was not successful at it. I got the impression that he was trying to write "It's a wonderful Life" with different characters. I cannot believe people are saying that it was a tear jerker. I thought the ending was very hokey and I left with the feeling that his life was the way he pictured it, worthless. I kept thinking there would be some great revelation. There was none. The whole book was a disappointment. The best thing about it was it was over quickly!
It's really not the best...: I was excited to read this book b/c it's been given so much praise, but I was so disappointed. It's a semi-sweet book which, from start to finish, was superficial. Superficial is fine if a book is entertaining as it goes on, but this was just sort of a dull story in my opinion. I can appreciate Albom's idea of this man's journey to heaven, but his version pretty cliche and trite. I was excited to read this, but was really let down...sad.
Arrogance: Growing up in the Detroit area, you would be hard pressed to not know Mitch Albom. Mitch has brought a great deal of joy to many peoples lives over the age of 70. From his radio show, columns in the Detroit Free Press, to Tuesday's with Morrie Mitch one word can sum up Mitch...Arrogance. Whether it is the controversy involving his dealings with the University of Michigan's basketball team, or a stern lecture about what is right on his horrible radio show, Mitch knows it all. Just ask him he will tell it like it is. This book is no exception. Mitch's style of writing is similar to something you would expect from a first time author. Very basic and lacking in creativity. Do yourself a favor avoid Mitch at all costs. Those that come contact with his radio show, columns or books usually become incensed with rage. That is unless you are a putz like him.
Obvious, shallow, cheesy: This book is a waste of time and money. It is too obvious, doesn't add any real lesson. No inspiring moment.No insights or original thoughts. Just cheap "philosophy".Maybe Richard Bach lovers will like it. Just maybe.
5 Reasons Not to Read This Book: The title of Mitch Albom's new book sounds interesting enough and could be developed into a great story; but I couldn't find it here. The author skirmishes into the lives and histories of five people whom 'Maintenance Man Eddie' may or may not have known; but doesn't do anything to improve the main character'sunderstanding of his pitiful and worthless life. I found thebook to be depressing to read. The only positive thing I tookaway was the brief time it took to read. It would have been amistake to invest more time or money. (David in Roanoke, Va.)
movie is better: Overall, I loved the plot of this book. Whether you're religious or not, it really makes you think. Unfortunately, I found the movie to be far better than the book, which is something I normally never ever say. But, the way Mitch Albom writes really bothered me. I can't put my finger on it just yet, but I really didn't enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed the movie.
Just Okay.: Kept my attention. Just a little too weird for me. The whole carnival setting & characters I just couldn't relate to.
3-B's: Boring Beyound Belief: I'm sure this book has something good to say, however I could not get past page 63. This book seemed as though it was written by a 10 year old, even the characters were boring. Although these are not the words in the book, I actually read a page that was written like this:The dog jumped over the fence.The cat jumped over the fence.The mouse jumped over the fence.The kangaroo jumped over the fence.The cow jumped over the fence.The moose jumped over the fence.I couldn't take it anymore. It was too boring to proceed to the end.Since the book is so short it should be read quickly, unfortunately it so boring that you have to labor on each page just to get to the end.Bad, Bad, BAD!
The Emperor's New Clothes Part II...: I thought "Tuesdays with Morrie" was sanctimonious drivel but this preachy, sappy, appallingly badly-written rubbish beggars belief. How on earth do writers like Albom get their worthless stuff published when so many better writers struggle for years? What alarms me most is that I suspect Albom himself is taken in by his guru-like persona and that we might be in line for some more of his potted wisdom before long. Blech!
Albom does it again: No wonder Albom didn't want his own newspaper to run the review of this book. Once again he makes a strained appeal to the largest audience possible. It's bad enough to get his holier-than-thou column every Sunday [I thought he was a sports writer anyway] but to market it should be criminal.
Very disappointing.: In ordering this book, I made the mistake in thinking that I would learn something about Which five people you meet in Heaven and why.Instead, it was a story about a veteran and people he met in his life. It was not illuminating for my life.
I WANT MY MONEY AND TIME BACK!: Didn't love! I purchased this book to entertain me during my plane ride home --- ended up giving it to the woman sitting beside me. I found it to be extremely boring and unenlightening.
Boring sentimental garbage: This book could have been good. If it had been about 200 pages shorter. The writing is slow, and stunted. The plot is cliche, without any real twists or turns. Within the first two sentences I could see exactly how this book would turn out. A man dies, realizes he was important to the world, and has his soul redeemed.This is pulp trash, meant to be read once and tossed at the bottom of the pile. Don't waste your time.
Very Disappointing: This book started out well but went nowhere.Feels like the author wrote it to profit on his"Tuesdays with Morrie" reputation.Tsk. Tsk Tsk. I sold mine on Amazon the day after I finished the book. Net loss, one evening and $0.75.
No thank you: What is this book? I can tell you what it is not: it is not original. It is not compelling. It is not reasonably priced. It is not intelligent. It is not wise.Wait: it is preachy. That's what it is.Read at your own risk.
Not as good as his other books: This story is good, and makes you stop and think about what does happen when you pass on. Every word counts in this one, as everthing is connected. It shows a lot of imagination on the part of the author. I do think you would like this book, particularly if you like Mitch's other books.
THe Five People You Meet in Heaven: Eddie, a maintance worker at Ruby Pier, has a tragic death. After his death, he arrives in heaven where he is told by the first person he meets, that in total he will meet five people. Some of these people he may not know, and others were around for a big portion of his life. ONe thing is for certain though each person had a signifcance in his life and they will teach or tell Eddie something new. THat is Eddie's journey in heaven in the book THe FIve People You Meet in Heaven. This book gives people who are looking for a meaning in their live an idea of where to find it.
Touching and excellent book: I'm not really that big of a book person, but I loved Tuesdays with Morrie and had heard a lot of good things about this book so wanted to read it. Definitely lived up to the hype, it was a great book and a quick read with some uniquely intriguing perspectives on how we live our lives and the effects that we can have on the lives of so many others without even realizing it. I give my highest recommendation!
Therapeutic: I read this shortly after my mom died, and I must say, it was very therapeutic, even if it were just fiction. It really made me consider death differently; that she was okay...in a better place. Later, I offered it to a friend who'd also lost a parent, and she felt the same way. It really helped her through the entire ordeal.I can't thank Albom enough for that. I've been a fan of his since his early sports writing days. I've read all his books thus far. Considering what I'd just said, you can only imagine how much I enjoyed: For One More Day. My mom died of a massive heart attack, so I never got a chance to say good-bye, let alone make amends. I'd give anything 'for one more day' with her. =/~Chad Clegg - Author of: The Domino Effect
Best Of Mitch's Books yet!: I have already read several of Mitch Albom's books, but so far, this is one of my favorites. I've read it twice, and given it to three friends for gifts.It's something I've always wondered about personally,and never thought anyone else did, as well.
reserve an afternoon: This book has to have been one of the best I've read in years. I started reading it early one Sunday afternoon, and after the first three chapeters, I knew I would not be able to do anything else until I was done. Everyone I know who has read it had the same experience. I have since spent much time contemplating the meaning to my life and who I have effected, and contrary to some reviews, I have not idea who I will meet there. I will give this book as a present to everyone I know.
One of the most unique outlooks on life! Great Book!: This was one of the best, if not the best book i have ever read! This book really makes you think about what it might be like in heaven. It gives you an outside look on life. It might give you a reason to help other people. This book gave a great idea of heaven, and how peoples lifes kind of "inter twine" with other peoples life. I could go on and on about this book but I dont want to give to much of this great book away!
A touching story: After weeping my way through Tuesdays with Morrie, I looked forward to Albom's The Five People You Meet in Heaven. (I actually saw the Made for TV version first and then read the book.) Albom has a way of telling a story very well in relatively few words. Perhaps this comes from his years of writing sports articles for the printed news media.The story of Eddie's life and the people whose lives he touched, and who profoundly touched his, was interesting enough, but it is the end of the story that makes this story great. It is not until then that the genius of this work becomes evident. It is then that the reader reflects on all that came before and gains a true appreciation of the story Albom tells. May we all learn from it.Carolyn Rowe Hill
Good Insperation, Just like Charles Dickens: Sure as some reviewers have said the book is simplistic and somewhat simple. But, DUH, isn't "the Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens also somewhat simplistic and simple? And don't the majority of us love and retell that story year after year?What I got out of this little book were the five lessions from each person Eddie encountered in heaven. These are lessons and thoughts we can apply to our daily lives. Just like the lessons and thoughts Scrooge learned to apply to his life.Take this book on face value. It is a fable, a parable similiar to an Aesop fable.ENJOY and avoid being critical.
Five People you meet LITE: dumbest book i ever read. he's a one hit wonder who should have stopped with 'tuesdays'.
Talk about a Grim fairy tale: This was the most depressing, horrible, miserable, ridiculous etc., etc., book I have ever had the misfortune to read. So presumably if you live a sad, bitter, painful and lonely life on earth, then eventually you will find out the reasons why - or some unbelievable drivel as to why and then - JOY, up to heaven to meet the celestial being who deemed that this was your lot. I would trade this fairy tale "everlasting" life for a few good years here below. Don't waste your time on this rubbish.
It's okay if you don't believe in it, just enjoy a little like chicken soup for the soul kind of feel.: It's a feeling of life. What you wonder, but without the feeling that you have to pick a religion. It's just life with a little mix of folk, involve with people, a little of chicken soup for the soul, and a little enjoyment. No, let's not put Jesus and the bible in this. Nope, just a thought of the what ifs in life after. Good read that's all. Got me a little teary too.
Absolutely wonderful read, I recommend to all.: Just the mere thought of going to heaven and meeting up with 5 people from your earthly life and seeing them again is phenomimanl in itself. But to have each person explain to you why specific events took place in your life, things that the charater had been bitter over. The talks with each person opens his eyes and he is a better man due to his confrontations. It really makes one wonder if that is the way it is in heaven and wouldn't be amazing if it were. To have someone explain events that you never understood yet that took place in your life. Highly recommend. One of the best books I have read in years.
A quaint vision: Mitch Albom has created a uniquely quaint and compelling story in the Five People You Meet in Heaven. The story is light and touching at the same time. Never did I feel bogged down in the story, nor did Albom ever become to heavy handed in telling us how we were supposed to feel.Although the story included sections almost cliche, and some transitions were seemingly a little rough, I found the read to be refreshing and uplifting. I was impressed that Albom never pushed us to come to any sort of conclusion, nor became overtly preachy. He just showed us an honest man, Eddie and his honest emotions as he enters heaven and begins meeting people who have touched his life in someway, sometimes in ways that he never knew about until he met them for the first time there in heaven.For a good light read, I recommend The Five People You Meet in Heaven.
An instant modern day classic: Mitch Albom writes what I feel to be one of the best works of fiction I have read in quite some time. The book follows Eddie in his journey through the afterlife after a sudden tragic accident. He encounters five people that made an impact on his life and each one offers a lesson. I painted quite a picture in my head with this book and was even moved to tears at a few parts. The thing I really liked though was that it wasn't just a sappy story about life and love but offered lots of philosophy on life and what lies beyond. It really is an amazing book that left me thinking long after I put it down which was one thing I did not do from page 1 to 196. I recomend this book because I believe everyone can take something positive from this story.
Wonderful and thoughtful book: I picked up this book at the library this week because I recongized the author and it looked like a short read. This was such a wonderful little book. It was very insightful and emotional. I did finish reading the book in one evening, but my only regret is that I didn't have a box of tissues beside me for the last half of the book. This is a great read and the author provides a different view of what heaven is like.
Very good book: Definitely one of a kind! the narration was very good and i really enjoyed the meaning behind this book. i recommend this to anybody for a good read
The five people you meet in heaven: A fast nice read with good character development. Gives you something to think about when you're done reading. I recommend this book highly.
Really makes you stop to think: This book makes you step back and examine your own life which is somewhat uncommon in today's literary world. How you may have impacted the life of someone else without even knowing it... how our lives all interwine with one another. A short and quick read with a long-lasting impact. I enjoyed this so much that I went out and bought several copies to give as Christmas presents. Definitely a tear-jerker.
boring: This book is overhyped. The subject is interesting and should be a delight for the readers imagination. Unfortunately the author was not; the accounts were uninspiring and very predictable.
Very Pleased~: I was caught up in it's pages from the very beginning. Mitch Albom is a very good author. I also fell in love with his book "Tuesday's with Morrie" after my high school history teacher read it to our whole class a few years back. He definitely knows how to put a precious life into a brilliantly charming page turner.
lovely story: This novel surely has beautiful and delight concepts which aspire and give hopeful inspiration to the readers along with the "Religious" enlightenment. I cannot deny that I liked and enjoyed reading this book, but I also admit that it was very much similar with the "Tuesday with Morie" (Mannerism?). But it was unique that the author unfolds the story back from the present to the past. As long as this book is not long and not complicated at all, it is worth a try and you'll get more than you expect. Recommended for those who like to purify their hearts with a short and light essay written in beautiful words.
Read The Traveler's Gift instead: This book is similar to "The Traveler's Gift" by Andy Andrews that came out in 2002. But The Traveler's Gift is much more inspiring book to read. I was expecting "The Five People You Meet In Heaven" to be heartwarming and uplifiting, instead it is depressing.
Everything happens for a reason...: Simply said, this is a novel written around the theme of "everything happens for a reason."Each person we meet in our lives, each course of action we are involved with, each path we embark on in our journey of life happens for a reason. We are destined to do certain things, meet certain people, and experience certain challenges, from the day we are born. This book is a classical example of this notion at its best.Mitch Albom has a gift - the gift of putting in writing, the most basic, yet most crucial, lessons of life which each of us will experience to one degree or another. Just as Albom inspired us with "Tuesdays with Morrie," he has continued to do so with "The five people you meet in heaven."A good read... a good reminder of our purpose here on earth.
The Five People You Meet in Heaven: Excellent book!! Such a strong message. Very emotional, but leaves you with a great feeling about life & dying. Everyone should read it once a year.
Sweet and sentimental story.: This book is a nice, quick read as long as you're not looking for ground-breaking literature. It tells the story of Eddie, a man who dies and then goes to heaven to meet the five people who have had a big influence on the course of his life. It's a sweet book, with likeable characters in it. I loved the way the author connected everything together. I recommend this book for when you're looking for some light reading.
A best seller???: Why is this book considered a best seller?I just started buying books again after I found most stories to be boring and redundant. I thought I would start at the best sellers list hoping to find a compelling story.It looks like I'll need to find myself a new hobby and buying best sellers will fall to the bottom of my to-do list.
DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE, Because the TRUTH is REAL!: This book is hackneyed pseudo-religious born again pulp, sprinkledwith two-bit sentimental sap-lines. This is a book for the illiterate herd. You WANT a REAL book about travels in heaven and hell...Read the Divine Comedy. If you want trash sap, here is a great mindless "sweet" book for you. Gob bless you herd-minded readers, may peace be with your carboard bookshelf.
Hard to believe, it is so passe....: I was born in 1940. I know the war years. I would think that the five people I would meet are from the 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's.I guess that a series on tv is coming up. My parents lived through the 2nd world war years. I find these stories trite and boring. I know better ones from the people who were there. The years of the cold war, the Korean war, the Bay of Pigs, etc., how can this book be socially relevant? I did not buy this book.
Regurgitated drivel: Talk about a THIRD RATE, predictable, and BORING story... I STRUGGLED to finish this over-promoted, over-rated book just so I could give an honest review. My advice to Mr. Albom: Stick to reporting baseball scores or, at a minimum, write a first person novel about an arrogant, mediocre sports writer who tries but fails to become a true life novelist. Mr. Albom is no Ring Lardner. Note: I would have given this book 0.1 stars but it was not an option. I chose 1 star over 0 stars because of the paper used for the book.
The better mousetrap: "It's A Wonderful Life" meets "Goodbye, Mister Chips" with a quick salute to "A River Runs Through It."If you admire books that are poorly written but are still clever commercial snares, then you should buy "Five People."
Disappointing: This book was so disappointing it left me in a bad mood the rest of the day. It begins by making you believe that Eddie at 83 years old never married Margarite. All he had of her was just the photo of her waving goodbye. Later on in the book you find out that he did marry her and had a loving marriage to her.It just doesn't measure up to "Tuesday's With Morrie".
So Disappointed--germainehawkins.com: It was one of the most disappointing books I have read in a long time. I am a christian which obviously means I believe in heaven and was looking forward to a book that would allow me the opportunity to ponder my affect on the lives of others and the greater meaning of my life. However, I found the book hard to follow, not well written, and did not provide and form of a reality check for me. I waited for a climatic moment with each person that he met in heaven and each passed with a disappointing conclusion. I have not read Tuesdays with Morrie and will never read another book by Mitch Albom.
ehh: i first thought this book would be alright, but after reading it, i didn't care for it too much. a problem i found with the book was its use of vulgarity...and yes, i do realize he was using it in the context of his characters speech, but to have it in a book on heaven and christianity seemed wrong to me. also, another problem i had with the book...in heaven we're to be there to glorify God and praise him, yet there was none of that in this book. so if that is something you are looking at this book for, i would reconsider because you won't find it in here.
Good read when you're in the mood for warm and fuzzy: I really enjoyed this book. It is a fast and easy read and you feel warm and fuzzy at the end. Perfect for curling up with on a chilly afternoon.
If you liked Celestine Prophecy, you'll love this!: I read this book on a two and a half hour flight. By the end I was skipping pages by two and three just to get it over with. The characters are one dimentional, the plot is forced and the dialog is simplistic. It embarasses me that so many other humans are rating this book so highly.
Self-conscious drivel: This is a fine example of self-conscious writing in which the author is saying, "See how sensitive, perceptive and thoughtful I am?" But "Five People" is adolescent, without substance, predictable and -- worst of all -- incredibly boring. The characters have no character. The plot is straight line. The theme pure pap. The only reason to read past page two is to amaze yourself that anyone would publish a verbal trainwreck. I can't say one good thing about this book -- except that paper burns and winter is coming.
Very disappointing: The title got me hooked but didn't deliver. Blahhh. After reading Albom's "Tuesday's with Morrie" and reading the reviews, I was very excited about starting this book. It was almost good enough to keep reading but when I finished, I thought "that's it?" Very boring book and character's not developed well at all. Sorry Mr. Albom, I hope your next book is better.
A touching novel that I've recommended to everyone I know!: For such a small book its message was big! I thought this was one of the most touching stories I've ever read. The idea is that when you die your life is explained to you by 5 people, some you know and some you may have never met. Albom's novel shows us that we are all connected and everything we do has an impact..maybe not on our own lives but those of others. Many parts of this book were sad and depressing, especially when you read about the main characters guilt over things that happened in Vietnam and the loss of his wife. But as the 5 people in heaven reveal their stories the main character finds the answeres to all the big "whys" in his life. It was like having resolution to everything you didnt understand that happened in your life. I cant give this book enough praise!!!
One of the best books I've ever read: "The Five People you meet in Heaven" was one of the best books I've ever read. It was sad, great, and you just wanted to find out the next person to be met. It was so sad that you wanted to cry but in a good way. I suggest you read it 100%.
Don't waste your time.: I only finished this book because it was required for a book club. All other members of the club considered it a waste of their time also. None of the 5 people gave any reason for the subject's existence as was the premise of the book. There was nothing in the book that made me feel better informed of anything at all. I like to be able to finish a book and feel I have been at least a little enlightened about something but there was nothing here. I won't waste my time with this author again, there are too many good books out there that have a compelling story line that entertains while enlightening the reader about something.
Boring and ridiculous: I listened to it on tape and I couldn't believe that there had been so much hype about this book. I thought it was completely contrived and ridiculous. BORING
Don't Bother: This is the worst book I have read all year. I was really excited to get the book, but as I started to read it I found the plot very weak and the characters shallow. If this book were any longer I would have thrown it out. I still can't figure out what people see in this book. The message is obvious after the first person you meet in heaven. Furthermore, the message is nothing that has not been said in a hundred other (and far better) books...or films for that matter (think It's a Wonderful Life)
A True Letdown: I thoroughly enjoyed Tuesdays With Morrie, and was looking forward to reading this book. I was totally disappointed with the entire experience. The anticipation was greater than the event, unfortunately.
On heaven...: If heaven turns out to be how Mr. Albom describes it, definitely I don't want to go to heaven. I've had many thoughts on what heaven can be, but never crossed the thought that I would have to reach heaven to fill myself with more regrets and guilts than those I left this life with. I have the conviction that we must try to become the best out of ourselves in this life, that we truly should be committed to this; but to reach heaven to meet people I never met in this life and be filled with remorse and guilt exceeds all my expectations.Having read "Tuesdays with Morrie", which is definitely an inspiration of love and a 'must read' to everyone, "The Five People You Meet in Heaven" is a most discouraging one.
This was a terrible read: I read "Tuesdays" and loved it, as many reviewers here. I bought this book based upon the depth of that previous book. Everything that "Tuesdays" is, this is not. The story rambles, and I just don't care enough about the characters. Like other 0 reviewers, I had to throw the book out after reading about 50 pages. I don't usually discard books, but this is definitely not a "keeper."
Poorly written yet good story: I liked the main idea about meeting five people, how they all had crossed path with Eddie somewhere, the idea that all the stories are connected and has different sides to each of them, and the lessons each of them gave. I get what the author wanted to write about.HOWEVER, the writing style just plain annoyed me. I didn't think it was necessary to repeat the same style over and over for five times with Eddie's birthday and the lesson chapters. These could have been all put together to make it a smoother reading.I watched the movie and the movie was EXCELLENT. There was none of the extra annoying repetitious of Eddie's Birthday chapters nor separate lesson chapters. It flowed really nicely (even though, it's pretty long).I would suggest that you watch the movie since it covers the entire book in a much smoother way. Also, for some reasons, reading the book was more depressing. Instead, the movie uplifted me.
Four stars for Five People: I went into the reading of THE FIVE PEOPLE with my eyes wide open. You should do the same . . . If I read a book that bores me after the first few chapters, I put it aside, maybe to try again sometime. If not, I give it away. Every book doesn't have to be life-changing, but if it can make me think, laugh, cry, inform me or fill an otherwise boring evening, it's done it's job for me. This book does that. Granted, I was thinking of "A Christmas Carol" meets John Edwards when I read it, but I have to admit it was a thought provoking, uplifting read. I enjoyed it! [...]
Not That Great...: I was very disappointed with this book. I was under the impression I was about to read something insightful and thought provoking....too bad this book is neither. I recommend skipping this one unless you enjoy wasting your time.
Sappy Fluff!: The comparisons to A Christmas Carol are true, but Dickens' book is superior. The reviews that this book is preachy are accurate as well. Think Celestine Prophecy. I thought that this would be a nice light interesting read with some substance. True, this is a light read that will take less than a couple of hours of your time. False, there is no substance to this book and your time is worth more than this.
Touching & Inspiring: I seldom read novels except Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code due to the phenomenal hype, but the title of this book had been interesting me for a while and kept me thinking who are those five people we are going to meet in heaven. So I decided to find out. The book is relatively short under 200 pages. It begins the story with the last day of an old man named Eddie, who will meet five people after his death in heaven to learn different lessons on the meaning of life. The beginning is a bit slow. It takes around thirty pages to set up Eddie's death. Honestly, as a reader, I couldn't wait to see the first person Eddie met in heaven and why. Despite that, the story goes very smooth and quite touching. Indeed, the author's perspective on fairness, sacrifice, memory, and love, inspires me a lot to re-think the meanings and values of life. I'm wondering who are the five people waiting for me when my time comes.(Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 20-Feb-2005)
loved it!: i loved this book! it was a quick, easy read, offering a perception of heaven i have never imagined.by the end of the book, i was crying as the loose ends in the life of the main character tied together to create a beuatiful tapestry.this book is sweet and heart-felt, and offers peace and reassurance to anyone who has ever doubted their importance or self-worth.as far as the individuals who left 0 reviews: yes, albom created a heaven where people are told they may have been responsible for the death of others, but it is a minute detail in the meaning of the bigger picture. by focusing on this point, your missing the moral of the novel!
A moving experience: This short, simple book was one of the most moving pieces I have ever read. I found myself crying profusely at different moments. The book brought back many memories of my loved ones that have passed away, and how wonderful it would be to just see them one more time. It also had some very funny moments. For me, it is a book of hope and bittersweet dreams. I strongly recommend it to all, especially the cynical amoungst us.
five people you will meet in heaven: The story is well written. It is complex connecting 5 interesting characters. Each has a lesson to be learned and answers the reasons for the protagonists life.
The five people: I read this book in one day. it is hard to put down at times. simple and to the point
Good read: A quick read and interesting take on life and life after death. The butterfly effect, every little thing we do has an effect on something.
A message that sticks: Although this book is fictional, the message is profound. What we are here for, who matters and how we relate to others are explored vicariously. I enjoyed every page of this book and thoroughly recommend it. I also recommend Mitch Albom's earlier book, Tuesdays with Morrie.
A book with good diction that is missing something...: Entranced by "Tuesdays With Morrie", I bought this book the week it came out. I enjoyed it enough that I went through it really quickly, but I came out of it kind of unsatisfied, like having a meal without the main course- something was just missing. I went looking for the whatever it was, and found absolutely nothing when I reread the book.Albom has some good descriptive language, and an original plot if you don't think about the cliched "This is your life"-type ideas. (Yes, that was sarcasm.) I really liked the book, and I think you will too, if you are considering buying it, but don't look to be totally fufilled at the end of this book. You'll find a small corner empty where there should be something.Overall, this book got four stars from me on merit of language alone. While Albom does have a tendency to lapse into cliches, I enjoyed the descriptions greatly.The verdict: buy this book, and read it when you've got time to contemplate things.
Maybe I'm not spiritual: This book is a nice little book, I guess . After reading it, I just do not understand how it is so popular. One of the customer reviewers even used the term, life changing. It certainly isn't heavy in insights. I suspect those who are moved by the book are very easily moved by simple little books.I agree with the reviewer who said a reader's time can be better spent on many other books.
No surprises: I don't want to say this was a BAD book - just that it exactly met and did not exceed my expectations. I expected that Eddie would meet some people he knew were important in his life and some people whose importance would be revealed to him. Yep. I expected that he would try to resolve some of the parts of his life that were difficult for him. Yep. I expected that it would have some sort of a "happy" ending (quotes are because he did die, after all). Yep.Well - I guess there was one unexpected aspect of it. I expected to care more about Eddie and his life - but I didn't.BUT most people that I have talked to including the person who gave it to me thought it was very moving and fabulous - so maybe there is something wrong with me.At least it was short.
Soul Searching Experience: I absolutely love this book. Words can not describe my feeling upon finishing this work of art. I feel like a better person for reading it. Thank you, to Mitch Albom, for giving me an outlet to do some much needed soul searching.
Must Read!!: I have finished two books in the last three weeks, this being one of them. As a pretty avid reader (6-12 books per year, mostly fiction) this is in the top five books that I have read all-time. It's a quick read, but one that you'll want to re-read as soon as you finish. Somehow he, the author, is able to capture very different emotions with each character, which would make this book very appealing to all types of people. Pick up a copy and read for yourself, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
Too sad to be uplifting.: The last sentence of this story summarizes the author's point and purpose beautifully: that all our lives and stories are connected, and everything has a purpose, however unseen or realized. BUT, I truly disliked this book!! I felt the 'point' was so poorly executed. The stories that unfolded were so sad and unnecessarily tragic that I was distanced and disturbed instead of connected and heart-warmed. The hero's life might have not been a waste, technically, but if he was too unhappy to realize the beauty in it, then the story is a tragedy in my opinion. I was expecting something uplifting, and couldn't have been more disappointed.
KIND OF A WASTE OF TIME-BUT: FIRST OF ALL I CAN'T BELIEVE THE REVIEWS THIS BOOK HAS RECEIVED..IT WAS AN EASY READ BUT CERTAINLY NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING IN LIGHT OF THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED REVIEWS..I GEUSS IT GOES TO SHOW WHAT A GOOD MARKETING TEAM CAN ACCOMPLISH.. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THE BOOK TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A GOOD OR INTERESTING STORY..OTHER THAN EDDIE'S HEROIC DEATH, I FOUND THE ENTIRE PREMISE RATHER BORING..ONLY TWO STARS FROM ME
the best book for reluctant readers: "the five people you meet in heaven". Is one of the best if not the best book that i have ever read. I myself am a reluctant reader i hate reading i would do anything but read. however this book was extremely hard for me to put down. I would try to read this book in my high school classes but i would be told to put it away and pay attention but all i could think about is this book. I would stay up until about 11 or 12 o'clock reading this book. I didnt pick this book because i had to read it for english i picked it because i read it for my 10th grade english class but never finished it and i decided to finish it. It has 6 strong point of veiws and 5 lessons to learn. Which maked it so hard to put down.
Not as anticipated: I was deeply disappointed in this book. I have read more meaningful books that costs much less than this one. The only way I would encourage someone to read it is if they get it for free.
Not nearly as wonderful as Morrie!: I was disappointed by this book because it felt so fake compared to Tuesdays with Morrie. I guess that story, being true, might have been easier to write, but I wanted more from this one.
The whole picture is what the book is about: I thought the book was wonderful...the title doesn't matter...the length of the book doesn't matter...It is what you leave with after finishing the book that matters...and I laughed, smiled and cried with this book...I don't think religion is an issue here and I do not think that it is compared to or is written from a person trying to push his views on others. Its a feel good book and the character does not go through everything to be good enough for heaven, he goes through everything so he can see the truth in every major event in his life and seek closure from it, so he can realize that sometimes not knowing the whole truth of an event can make us feel anger, hurt, loss, and hate because it is what made sense at the time and he learned and grew as a person knowing the full account of each event. That is the most important message i got from the book.
Disappointing :o(: I am stunned that this book remains on the best seller list! This book is honestly just fair at best. It was not a horrible book, it was just missing something. I kept waiting for the story to get more interesting but, in the couple hours it took to read it--it never got any better. :o( Of course this is just my opinion...obviously alot of people think highly of this book. I just keep wondering WHY????
A beautiful fable: This is a tale that is both general enough to be applied to any reader's life and so rich with detail that I came away knowing Eddie intimately. I'm amazed that I learned so much, and got so many lessons about why things happen for a reason, in so few pages. I walked away from this book knowing that are lives are intertwined with other people, like the Blue Man and Ruby, who are far outside our immediate circles. This book made me appreciate everything I have in my life.There are some unforgettable quotes in here:[p 78]: "'Strangers,' the Blue Man said, 'are just family you have yet to come to know.'"[p 167]: "All parents damage their children. It cannot be helped. Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents smudge, other crack, a few shatter childhoods completely into jagged little pieces, beyond repair.
Awesome Book!: This book is basically about a man named Eddie who dies. However, after he dies, he gets to meet 5 people who were a part of his life. Through these visits, you learn about Eddie's life and Eddie discovers what his purpose was. This was a real tear-jerker but it was great! I would definitely read more of Mitch Albom's work based on my experience with this book. If you like any of Nicholas Sparks' books or just inspirational/spiritual books in general, this is definitely one for you!
What A Wonderful Book!!!: Dare I say this was the best book I've ever read? It reminded mevery much of the movie A Wonderful Life with Jimmie Stewart.The first book I've read by this author, now I'll have to read"Tuesdays With Morrie":)All the books I've been reading strike a chord with me, but thisone, I felt that I could have been the main character. I feltsuch a close relationship to the subject matter.Eddie is a carnival repairman, and the story begins with hisdeath. He feels his life was nothing, but he meets five very surprising people who show him otherwise. Some of these people he didn't even know existed.This was a very quick read, and one that I'd recommend to everyone. This reviewer rates it a five, because it's as good asit gets:)
Great book: This was a great book! I just finished it today. It was very touching and very inspiring. I've read the other reviews here, and the only thing that I can agree upon with the bad reviews is that the book was short, but that's part of it's allure!!! It was to the point and while reading it, you were never sitting there thinking....I wonder what's next, because I'm absolutely bored...that was NEVER a thought I had while reading this book. The writing was excellent and I believe that anyone could relate to this story! Thanks Mitch Albom, and I thank your Uncle Eddie!!!
Like a chocolate souffle: Well, if you just want to entertain yourself for a couple of hours, this will do it. Nothing profound here. A lot like "Who Moved My Cheese" or "The Present."
Five people you meet: It was a very good book. It explains the reason why he lived & some had to go. It was very touching & heart warming
Not for intelligent readers.: Sorry, but this is the sappiest, most insipid book I've read in a long time (and I read 50 books a year). So simplistic in the way it spoon-feeds you emotion after trite emotion. Save your money and buy a dozen cupcakes...you'll get nearly as much sugar.
Blah: The quality of writing in this novel is sophomoric and it shows in the dialogue and the descriptive text. Might be a good simple read for children but there are much better novels for adult consumption.
Only partially interesting: I cannot deny that some of this book was fascinating, but having said that, it was not fascinating enough to hold my interest from start to finish. Very creative, but in parts, very boring as well. Not a rereader in my opinion.
Absolutely amazing!: I'm so glad I made the desicion to purchase this book! I read it in 3 days! It really makes you think about the supernatural, leaves you with a sense of appreciation and brings about a new kind of alertness when meeting new people or familiar faces. You won't regret buying this book I promise you!
the five people you meet when you die: This was a fun and entertaining book. A quick read. Makes you think about the affect you have on others
Good reading in a short format: I read this book in an afternoon. I enjoyed it a lot. It made you think about our role here in life, our reason for being, and how we impact others...quite insightful. I grew up in a town a few blocks from an amusement pier, so for me, the descriptions of that brought back memories. Good character development. If you lost a husband or wife lately, you may find some comfort in this book.
Beautifully Written: I thoroughly enjoyed this beautifully written book. It is so worth your time reading. You leave the last page with moist eyes and the feeling you have been given a gift. And you have if you take it in.
Beautiful, but he should have...: Beautiful. Reminds us that we are not alone and are exactly where we are meant to be in this fast, lonely, never-perfect, dog-eat-dog world. I only wish he reviewed his Tagalog. 'Sundalo' is the Filipino (he would say 'Philippine') word for soldier, not 'sundalong'. It was rather distracting.
Big disappointment: I rushed out to buy this book when I heard about it and read it in two days. While the twist at the end was interesting, the book was a big letdowns from the reviews and the hype.
Manipulative: The entire book felt contrived to create a certain emotional effect in the reader. Full of cliches.
Overly Cute Book: This is an overly cute book. It literally reeks of saccharine. It is poorly written and reads like a rip-off of other, better books dealing with spirituality.This a huge disappointment since Mitch Albom was the author of the wonderful Tuesdays With Morrie.
I agree--poor writing!: Tuesdays with Morrie it ain't, but it is cleverly marketed to look like it. The jist of the book is that heaven is a place where your life is explained to you by five pivotal people in your life. The author flashes back and forth between the past, present, and hereafter too quickly for the story to be imbued with any meaningfulness--it was pretty banal from beginning to end. Halfway through I just wanted to put the book down and not take it up again, but I forced myself to finish only b/c it is a short book. (Incidentally, the war scenes in the book are not believable.)
my daughter needed it for a class...it was fine: She REALLY loved this book and got an award for writing the best paper in the entire 9th grade class. ALso great to add to t een reading list.
Mitch Albom: Once again, Mitch Albom has not let me down as an avid reader!I have passed this book onto others
Great book !: This is a very intresting and enjoyable book to read and memorable, I would recomend it to others for a good read .
Sweet and Insigntful: This book was so well written! It is the sweet- sometimes sad- story of a man and his life interwoven with scenes from heaven. The threads of this tale are masterfully woven together and gave me great appreciation for how my own story is woven together in ways I can't yet see. It's a fast read. And afternoon well spent.
A deep reading that causes you to reflect on your life.: Mitch Albom is an incredible writer. I had trouble getting into this book at first, but as I read on, I could see how he was relating circumstances in his character's life is no different than the events in our own life which can impact other people's lives, both positive and 0.
Inspiring: The title of the book caught my attention which spark my interests. I check out the book from the library to read to my son. This was a way to help developed his comprehension skills. Turn out, we both look forward each day reading the book to learn more of the adventure the main character endure. I would only read limited chapters during the school week, and more during the weekend. Later, we viewed a dvd movie version of the book. It was good; however, the book was better.
Poorly Written: I bought this book with great expectations. It was on the N.Y. Times best seller list and had much popular support. It's the closest to formula fiction I've come across in a long time. The premise of the story doesn't work from the beginning--an 83 year old man with a bum leg doesn't work at an amusement part checking the rides! The structure of the book is a formula throughout--man dies, goes to heaven, sees different colors, and a new person appears with lame advice and a really lame piece of philosophy. To say I was disappointed is an understatement!
Simply Dreadful: This book was given to me as a gift. It's so poorly written, I couldn't help wondering what the publisher was thinking. Made to appear as another "Tuesdays with Morrie", Albom sinks into a 5th grade writting style with a Christmas Carol theme. It's preachy, phony, sappy and tries to appeal to the emotions of the Oprah crowd. A dreadful money grab and not even worth the deep discounts offered here. Avoid this book as it piles up on the floors of your local Kmart.
Thought-provoking novel: Eddie is a 82-year old man with a limp from an old knee injury that he got during the war. He works as the Chief Maintenance at Ruby Pier, when one day he dies in a tragic accident. He is transported to afterlife, where he meets with five people that determined the course of his life, even though he sees some of them only for the first time. Slowly but surely he starts to understand why his life went the way it went as he forgives and is forgiven the acts that caused him pain and that made other people suffer.The idea that heaven consists of five people explaining your life, but also that things go the way they go because lifes are interconnected, even when it is not blatantly obvious, is thought provoking, even though some people may consider it to be somewhat new age. The book is well-written, a wonderful read for a long Satuday evening by the fire.
this idea was new in the 80's: the good news is, it's an easy read. if you've done little or no spiritual work, this book will be a revelation and uplifting. if you're a bit beyond that, it's trite and not that interesting, sorry!
Poorly Written: As much as I wanted to like this book, I couldn't bring myself to. The characters are flat and the plot predictable. If you're really looking for a book that explores death and the afterlife well, try Hotel World by Ali Smith or The Lovely Bones by Alice Seabold. They're much more worth the money and time.
The New Jonathan Livingston Seagull: Hallmark greeting card sentiments litter this book, posing as philosophical profundities. Why would anyone want to believe that heaven exists as some kind of therapeutic analysis meant to explain your earthly existence. What is the point? You're dead already! Albom fuses a little Buddhist Karma philsophy with Jewish mysticism to create this banal concept of heaven. I sure hope I don't end up there!
Hyped too much - disappointing: I was hoping this book was as good as "Tuesdays with Morrie", guess I bought into the hype.
Huh.: Huh. Interesting but... not all there. I must say I was intriuged by this book's plot. It could have gone a long way, but Albom did not take it to its full potential. Its rather tired morals and clichd dialogue put a weight on the otherwise airy pace, scenes of near-rape and death bed repentance seem out of place in the book's almost whimsical narration. Airplane reading.
Not bad for light reading: I was given this book as a gift and felt obliged to read it. I believe if I am honest in my review I would have to say that the best thing about the book is the fact that it is a very quick read. If you are looking for deep reading, this is not it.I have read the author's other book, Tuesdays with Morrie, and found it to be a fairly good book, but 'Five People' does not measure up to the bar set by the author's other work.
Five People Who Bore You In Heaven: Reading the NY Bestsellers List can sometimes lead you to books that sound interesting but turn out to be a complete waste of time. The idea was an interesting one; you die, you meet five people who teach you wonderful insights on your life that you overlooked while you were on earth. However, that would work much better had the main character led a corrupt life in the corporate world or had actually overlooked something in his life (which would have been cliche but much more believable). This was not the case in this book. Eddie seemed to be a man who had some ghosts in his past but overall was a very loved man and a led a very quiet life. This made the lessons he learned almost seem redundant. To top it off, the writing was very poor. It wasn't much of a page turner and at many points, it was very predictable and bland. If you really want to learn some life lessons that enlighten you, pick up his other book, "Tuesdays With Morrie."
loved it!: i got this book as a gift, and i couldnt put it down! i still read this today, and i buy it as gifts!! i buy all of mitch albom's novels, theyre great!
The most extraordinary book I've read in a year or two: An excellent novel that makes you think of the repercussions of the actions, even the most miniscule, that you take every day. This is definitely a book that everyone who loves reading should have.
Mitch Does it again!: After the release of the book, I heard him speak about it at the Texas book Festival. This book lived up to Everything i thought it would be. Dont go in thinking it will be another Tuesdays with Morrie, its not. Mitch shows another side.
An Enchanting Story: A great story on the meaning of life and how our lives can have a profound impact on other's lives, without us even knowing it. I loved this book!
There are better ways to spend your time.: The book is a simple little parable. It's neither very good nor very bad. It just doesn't really do much at all. With so much to learn and read about in this world and so little time to do it in, there are better books to put on your list.
Heavens No: Having read Tuesdays With Morrie, I welcomed the opportunity to delve into another inspirational tale as told by Mitch Albom. With its appetizer-sized chapters, I thought this would be a great "tween" book as I ventured from one long novel to the next. What a disappointment. This book was not only depressing, which I gathered from the reviews I had read prior to purchase, but it lacked any sort of resolution or true connectivity. The story was jumbled, and the veiled attempt to tie it all in failed miserably. Moreover, much of the supposed resolution our protagonist finds is hardly believable. Tuesdays With Morrie is one of the best books I've read, but, after this, I doubt I'll ever spend a penny on any of Mitch Albom's books again.
Incredible: In a world were we are often in a rush, and worry more about ourselves, than what we may be doing for others, and how our lives our linked to everyone around us. I was truly touched by this amazing story of one mans life and how if affected the people he came into contact each day. It teaches each of us a valuable lesson that we never know who's live we may alter each day.
At times moving, but ...: The first person he met is questionable. Didn't really see the point. The last person he met ... the author was definitely trying to make it come together, but IT TOTATALLY DOES NOT WORK; IT WAS FORCED, AND SO 'FAKE'. If Eddie (the protagonist) is traveling through 5 different pockets of heaven, where each soul creates what they want to share with Eddie, then why doesn't the Asian girl speak better English? She's old enough to speak well. Why does she have to speak in broken English? She is in heaven now. Anything is possible in heaven, even good communication. Overall, the book is a quick read. I finished it in 2 hours. It does make you think and value your days on earth. Of course, don't think too hard about the book and the author's choices or else you'll start seeing holes; big holes which may put a damper on that sense of feeling good after a sweet paperback.
Wonderful Story: I really loved and enjoyed this book. I also saw the movie first and that made me want to read this book. I would really recommened this book. It even made cry. I also recommend the other book by Mitch Albom "Tuesdays with Morrie -An Old Man, a Young Man, and Life's Greatest Lesson".
great story: I bought the book at the airport and truly it turned out a fun read and simply wonderful story. I couldn't stop reading....because I always wondered "what's nxt' :o)
Irresistible: A lot of the people who review books here seem self-conscious about reading something that isn't great literature--and won't give high marks for entertainment value. Don't people read novels for entertainment? If a book holds you enthralled until the end and makes you wish you had the idea first and could have written it; in my mind it deserves the highest rating. I don't think this book could have been better. It made me wonder who I might meet in heaven should heaven be like the author's idea of it. If you are a literature snob don't read it. If you like entertaining and wonderful books you should read it and I know you will be happy you did.I listened to the unabridged audio cassette version of this book. I really wish they would tell you when each side is finished and to either turn the tape or fast forward to the end.
A Glimpse Beyond: By Jan Rivers, Colorado Springs, COWhat happens just beyond this life? What is heaven like? Everyone asks. But only Mitch Albom could turn his Uncle Edward's sickbed glimpse into a curious tale of amusement park characters here and beyond.With delightful imagination, Mitch Albom brings insights about the afterlife which invite readers to re-examine the present -- and their assumptions about life, death, and heaven.Readers who like Albom's fictional exploration of what happens just beyond death may also enjoy the real-life beyond-and-back experiences told to Celia M. Hastings in THE UNDERTAKER'S WIFE.
Must read!!: LOVED THIS BOOK. MITCH WRITES FROM THE HEART AND YOU FEEL IT ALL THROUGH THE BOOK.COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN FOR VERY LONG.
Very Good: This was a very easy read. I really enjoyed this book. This is a perfect book for someone who wants to feel connected to a lost loved one.
The Best Book I Ever Read: I loved this book. It was really good. I liked the whole set-up. Eddie has to meet with five people who were connected in his life in order to move on. The five people he meets are all interesting - people who were very important in his life to people he hardly met or only slightly knew. I think that is how we all go through life - having people who mean a lot and also affecting people we don't even know that we did.It all culminates with the last person he meets. I don't want to give the ending away, but the last person he meets actually shows him how important he was even though he never thought he was anyone important.I have read his next book, "For One More Day," but it was not as good as this one. I am looking forward to reading his new book, "Have a Little Faith," but will have to wait until summer vacation. I have too much to read in the 10th grade!I think everyone should read this book.
Very depressing, NOT really something you should read: This book has a great title, but the story is based on a man who has a life that he really did not want and then dies goes to heaven and finds out who's lives he touched in a good and bad way. This book inspired me in the sense that I really do NOT want to be like that man so let me do the very best I can, if I don't like a job, I will change as soon as possible, opposite of the point the book wants to make. The book makes the point that the man hated his job but stayed anyway blessed a lot of kids or people, but hated his life! I can't understand other reviewers I really can't.Buy life's Golden ticket, so much more inspirational. Also I need to say that this is my first 0 review.If you are an other reviewers and want to explain to me with respect why it is a very good book please do.Keep on reading.
Unhappy with lack of response & product: I ordered 3 books at the same time. Two were received. This one was not. I was supposed to have it a week ago. I sent an email. No response. No book.
to say this book is a waste of time is a kindness: To say this book is a waste of time is a kindness! It was off the mark, barely cohesive. It was badly strung together and certainly not worthy of the author who wrote Tuesdays with Morrie.
yech: The publisher review above cautiously uses the terms "saccharine" and "preachy", and tries to make it sound like the book prevails in spite of meeting these descriptions. They are good descriptors for it. Mitch Albom must have sold this soap mainly on the merits of Tuesdays With Morrie. If you're looking for the likes of Tuesdays with Morrie, don't bother. If you like saccharine, go for it.
Awesome Book: Great book and very eye openning. I loved this book and highly recommand this book to everyone! Spiritual uplight
disappointed: I am returning this necklace. The silver is so bright that it looks fake, and the CZ settings are klunky, not delicate the way it appeared in the photo.
Great Eye Candy, Just Wish It Were Bigger!: I have to admit that I bought this case because it was suggested to me by a "build your own computer" website. When it arrived, I was in love. However, since I have now decided to go with an I7 chip set, it will require more than simply the generic CPU heatsink. The bottom line is that the case may not be wide enough at 8.1". Other than that, I have no problems with it at all. Antec does it again!
Not Happy upon recieving: The product arrived with the side of case locked. The key was inside the case in an unreachable area. I had to remove all the outside drive coverings to gain access, and then I was just barely able to cut the box with a bent hangar to have items fall to a reachable area inside. This is not the reason why I ordered one day shipping. Who was the genius in the company that decided to lock the key inside the case?!
Looks good but you can do better: I was disappointed in this case and do not recommend it. Pros: It looks cool, its quiet, and the inside has solid fit and finish. Cons: Power supply was DOA and Antec was not helpful with getting a replacement, did not cover my shipping costs nor offer any assistance with the new PS I had to buy to diagnose it. The HDD and Power lights on the front of the case don't actually exist, unless they are hidden really well. There are better cases for less money out there.
Grounding Issue: Mine had a grounding issue which apparently has been solved. I contacted Antec- they sent me the middle piece (formerly chrome, now black), no instructions, no information. Ridiculous. I bought a NZXT, problem solved.
Classic: Received this book as a child in 1964. Bought it for my son ... it's the best Dr. Seuss book in my opinion
kids love it: I enjoy reading this and the kids love to listen. Soon they will start to read it them on they own!
not his best, but still great: Dr. Seuss, a classic. This tell of one boy's vivid imagination will make children happy and make us adults try to reconjure our own dreams. The characters are funny and the names will have your tongue in knots. Certainly not his best, I'd say that is is more political and social commentary, but definately a fun fun book to have if you don't already.
colorful way of changing everything: We, fourth and fifth graders, read And to Think That I Saw it on Mulberry Street by Dr Seuss . A boy walking on Mulberry Street was going to his house when he sees a horse pulling a wagon and starts adding spectacular things to it like zebras, elephants, and more while going to his house from school. He describes what he thinks the horse and the wagon will look like with the stuff on it. Then he puts more to make it like no other. He did this because his dad said to look and see what you can see but he turns stuff into something amazing like turning minnows into whales. The illustrator carefully chose when to add color and when to not. It's a great a book because it he turns things into better things like changing a horse to a zebra to a reindeer and then to an elephant. If you look closely you will find extra funny stuff.
Disappointed: This spatula broke the first time I used it; the plastic snapped while I was scraping down the sides of a bowl. I would recommend silicone spatulas made by Orka and Trudeau.
Love this book: This book is wonderful!! The copy we got didn't have the same cover as the one shown, but who cares!!! It is such a sweet story of animals, & gives you a peek into what it might be like...
This is NOT 5.5lb density!: I have bought 100's of items from amazon over the years, this is my first review; THAT is how disappointed I am with this product.I bought this thinking it was a 5.5lb density memory foam mattress. This is definitely NOT the case. It is more like 2lbs per foot dense. A queen size 4" topper is 80" x 60" x 4", thus it is 19,200 Cubic inches. To convert that into feet, divide that figure by 1,728 (12x12x12) = 11.11111 Cubic feet of foam. SO, at 5.5 lbs per cubic feet, this topper should way over 60 pounds. But, shipped, with box and cover, this weighs in at a scant 24 pounds!For someone looking for a low density memory foam topper, this may be the one. But, for those of us that think the 5.5 used in the advertisement of this topper refers to the density of the foam, they will probably be disappointed.
READ WARRANTY BEFORE BUYING: Wish I had read warranty before buying this memory foam mattress. After 6 months, mattress has lost support and takes a long time to recover shape. We are constantly turning and rotating mattress to try to find an area that still maintains support. E-mailed company, through Amazon, and was told to read warranty. First disclaimer in warranty states that warranty DOES NOT COVER increase in softness or decrease in slow recovery (retaining shape) features. Very poor product.
Comfortable: This mattress pad has held up well since we bought it about 2 months ago. It is however almost too thick, I think I would go down an inch in the future. The topper often times has to be readjusted because it starts to shift on the mattress, so make sure you have a deep pocket mattress pad and well fitting sheets to help keep the topper in place. Don't expect to use the cover that comes with the topper for anything more than an extra layer to protect the foam it will not cover the mattress.
sleeping on clouds: We have a firm mattress and the 4" pad feels very comfortable. Memory foam pad is very soft however not in a way that would numb your back. You still feel a firm support around your body. If you have not had memory foam experience before it might be harder for you to envisage the feeling nevertheless, it basically contours evenly around your body.
Visco-elastic? How bout just a sponge?: It is made with such a cheap material that you will not be able to find another product to waste your money on, ever.
Just what I needed: I got this only a few days after I ordered it and it was in great condition and exactly what I needed.
All over the place: There's an awful lot of drama and detail and a huge amount of self absorption in this book.It holds one's attention the way "reality" tv does.I can't recommend it though as I don't feel the character got any wiser nor do I feel at all enriched from reading it.If one assumes this is fiction it might make more sense though the story is still all over the place.I feel it's best that one at least look at the possibility that this book isn't strictly true. It might save one resentment later.Salon has written a good article on Castaneda's work that speaks to this question.It's here: [...]
Fictional: Donner is supposdly one of Castanada's "inner circle disciples" that has dropped out of the public eye. This book is just a continuation of the Castanada myths. This is a difficult book to take serious, unless your new and naive to Castanada's writing and are still entralled by the myths. Donner's book is just another typical Castanada story with a slightly different twist to it, in order to sound original and credible. This technique has worked well for a whole slew of parasitic writers that re-write the basic Castanada themes and present them as original and make a ton of money off the gullible. She is just another parasite ripping off Carlos Castanada devotees.
Weakness: The weakness of this book is the author's stereotyping the role of the book's characters and culture. The strength of the book is the excellent style and grammar in the writing. I don't rate a book on style and grammar alone. The content basically lacks existential meaning.However the author does stab at how one can get others to submit to being controlled. For example, the controller claiming they have supernatural power like reading the other persons mind, getting the submissive to identify with a type of thinking that says, "if that is true then this must be true" when the two have little or no correlation, and the age old control technique of "give up self" to gain super powers. Control also is shown in the insecurity and anxiety of the relationships.Unless you only want to witness good grammar, I don't recommend this book.
THE THOUSAND ORCS ARE NO MATCH FOR DRIZZT!!: The story starts off in the spine of the world. Drizzt and his friends are after the killers of tred mcnuckles'cousins and brother. 1000 orcs seem easy enough don't it think again in the battle between orcs and Drizzt,friends will they survive well of course they do,because they have a trilogy, well Drizzt does anyway, but the battle is furious and it will make your heart race like you ran 100 miles!!! YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK IT IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!!! MAKE SURE YOU PICK UP THE OTHER TWO BOOKS TO COMPLETE YOUR CHRISTMAS LIST!!!
Not one of Salvatore's finest: I didn't care for this story at all. The story moved very slowly and the characters were very shallow. I kept waiting for the story to pick up, and was sorely disappointed when the predictable end came. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is that Salvatore introduced a Dwarf cleric and I was impressed with this new character. Drizz't fans all over will be disappointed.
my..: gee, ima not sure 'bout everybody else but i kinda liked it... and i hate to say it but i'm not a teen boy either ;) i'm a preteen girl..
Awesome Book!!!: R.A. Salvatore's writing is fantastic. The multidimesional depth of his characters is amazing. It is a wonderful first book to a triology I can't wait to read.
what a dissapointment: I've been a big fan of the entire series since I read the dark elf trilogy. It was so good that I even showed the book to some friends who also share the same enthusiasm about the series. Since then, I have read all of the Drizzit books (even the ones without him). I've found that only the first 7 (and the Entreri book) are fantastic. The rest much like this one are 50% garbage. I dont like Catterbrie, despite the fact that she has all of the great weapons she stinks. She is extremely annoying and I hope they kill her off. I also find her relationship with Drizzit ludicrous. Wulfgar was only cool when he was a bad ... barbarian instead of a loser with emotional problems, he should have stayed in the abyss. Regis was funny, now he's just annoying. Drizzit should go back to being a loner, its what he good at. He's become to soft hanging around the rest of the crew, they hold back his true potential.
Another great book in the Drizzt series: I Love to see some of the characters from other books come back into the storyline Pikel rocks!! I does get predictable in some parts but that does not really take away from the book mostly because you really want it to happen
Cool Cover Mr. S.: I purchased the Thousand Orcs when it first came out with the notion of reading it one day because the cover was so cool. That's how I pictured Drizzt. Spoiler alert: That scene was not in the book - 1 star. I've read just about all Salvatore's dark elf series and I'm a fan, but I found the book wanting. The entire book appeared to be nothing but several short stories about characters I don't really care about, other than Drizzt's core group. At the end it comes together, but it seemed forced. The jumping around to the various other groups was jarring and didn't add anything to the story. I feel that the author missed a golden opportunity to make this a mystery. Why are the orcs rampaging, why are the giants helping them, are the drow involved? I was expecting a lot more from the story and the author. But hey...the cover was cool.
Call it 9/11 in Faerun: It was evident from the start, with all the talk of death in Drizzt's musings between sections that Salvatore was dwelling upon and drawing from the terrorist attacks in the US last year. It became more apparent as the story reached its climax and the decription of mutilated bodies, loss of friends and ultimately the collapse of a wizard tower that 9/11 was exactly what Salvatore was using as his inpiration for this novel.I didn't dislike the book, it though I wonder why all the these characters have such a hard time coming to terms with their own feelings. Drizzt speaks about living in the present yet he is too frightened to even speak his thoughts to the woman he loves. Build a bridge; get over it. Either kill her or let them get married.I believe that Salvatore is trying to breath life into Drizzt the same way the death of Chewbacca reanimated Han Solo. Lets hope it works, though unless a certain mortally wounded character ends up dying, this probably won't happen.
Don't miss this one!: This book is without a doubt the most refreshing change of pace in the Dark Elf books yet! It's absolutely filled with Salvatore's trademark battle scenes and Dwarven humor, as well as a nice touch of tension. You'll quickly discover the obvious truth to this trilogy: It's going to be full of dark surprises and more action than Drizzt can handle(never that).Buy it, read it, love it! This book is worth every penny... and then some.
Terrible Beginning to a New Series: Salvatore has lost it.RAS used to be one of the most enthralling authors in the Fantasy genre. Now he's stale, rehashes old plots, has no substance to his characters, and nobody can die.It's really quite tragic.
Awesome book: Thoroughly enjoyed it. A little different than some of his other books but in a way that I personally loved.
Again a great one: This book is great. I recommend any and all fantasy lovers to get this book and read it. Everytime he releases another book in this series I buy it, and he has never let me down... This one lives up to the oters with action and rich characters. In the continuing saga Drizzt and the companions get a deep look inside and with breathtaking action scenes this one will never let you down.
Boring garbage: After reading all the previous Drizzt novels his work on the Hunter's Blades Trilogy is almost unbearable to read, in fact I could not bring myself to finish reading the final book in the series, it just seemed like the same old stuff repeated over and over and over and over again. The "plot" just seemed to get worse and worse..... very disappointed in his work in this series, oh well gives me time to explore other works such as Dragon Age: The Calling, which was surprisingly a pretty good read. No more R.A.S. books for me as his work has seemingly degraded into complete garbage....though I will say I did enjoy his earlier work. A pity that his work on these terrific characters has become awful in my opinion. Agree or disagree, it just my opinion and everyone is free to their own.
Predictable Prose: RA Salvatore's writing is very pedestrian in style and seems more like a play by play commentary of some D&D game than anything resembling a novel. This book is only recommended for 14 year old fanboys who judge a book's quality by the numbers of magic items carried by the heroes.
Back To The Old Days: The latest edition of the Icewind Dale series represents a return to the good old days of the original trilogy. A grand quest for yet another Dwarven stronghold, and hordes of monsters to slay. It's very satisfying to see the whole gang back together again.
A Slice of Salvatore Heaven.: There is so little one can say about this book without ruining it. Just know that Drizzt and the gang are back into the orc bashing bussiness (and for a whole series too!) and this time they aren't coming out with a few bumps and bruises. Drizzt is not immortal, neither is his friends. This books shows how easily that is applied. Wonderful as it is though, I have a beef with it. It is CALLED The Thousand Orcs. But no one actually FIGHTS the thousand orcs. A lot of them, yes, but not a thousand. (and giants don't count). Regardless of the somewhat fudged title, it's still a good book. If you get the chance, check out the advertisements for the book. The one with the numbered outlines of the orcs on the cover picture of the book is priceless.
Many promising things to come!: This book was a good book standing on its own. The Drizzt saga has had twists and turns, and if you've read them all as I have, you are familiar with some of the "filler" books such as Spine of the World, where nothing really happens except story filler. This book is not a filler book , but does set things up for the next two or more books. Parts of it are very reminicent of the Battle of Helms Deep from the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and the cover art is misleading, but overall, the book was worth reading!
Another Amazing read!!: Wow! THis is an amazing read and I recomend it highly. Bands of Orcs come out of the Spine, rampage, and invade. It is totally great....
The Thousand Orcs: Another amazing adventure for Drizzt and friends. I can't wait for the next one...
The group is back and ready to rumble: This book is a fast and fun read. Wulfgar and his friends have a new set of challenges on their journey back to Mithril Hall.New alliances are playing out and the dwarven lands are in danger. The orc forces seem to have organized and its up to Drizzt and Co. to set things right. I must say I was happy to see a couple of my favorite dwarves back in action. Salvatore did a great job with this one. I think the battles and sword play should not be missed. Do yourself a favor and give this one a read!
Perfection: My only issue with these damn books is when will the author get Drizzt and Cattie together other than with the hand holding and hugs. Grr! I read this book in four hours and loved every word!
This is a work of art: From beginning to end this book had me hooked. Now this is the first R.A. Salvatore book ive read that pertains to Drizzt. This is an amazing book. R.A. Salvatore is truly the master of battle. He can paint a vivid picture in your mind. Its a great buy and I encourage any one to read this book.
The best is yet to come...: Salvatore is killing us! This book is a wonderful lead to so many different roads of possibilities. As with any trilogy you have to expect the author to set up the scene and this book does just that. If you have no experience with the characters or story lines do not start with this one. You have to understand the depth of each character to understand the enormity of the situation in their eyes. Drizzt- his worst fear, he's alone. Cattie Brie- her adoptive father out of action, facing the reality of mortality. Bruenor- ?? Anticipate the possibilities!
Great Adventure: I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was cleverly written. The adventure and action juts keep coming. I also enjoyed The Lone Drow. I cannot wait for the next book in the series.
The thousand orcs: This story was pretty good there is a lot of description and has a good story line. There is a lot of action so I would recommend it to a person that likes action books. This book is fiction and I like how the story is about some dwarfs. The enemy is orcs and ice giants who I like to read about. If you like to read about mythical creatures that kill stuff then I recommend it. I think this is about four stars to me because when I read it I got kind of side tracked and not as interested in it. Nikilwig is a pretty interesting character that is heading to Mithral hall. On the way there they encounter lots of monsters then get into lots of fights which I like to read about. This is my review of The Thousand orcs.
Be prepared to unprepare: What I mean is this. The books on Drizzt and company are starting to pile up, numberically I mean. You would expect that after writing so many books surrounding one set of characters that the quality of the series would decrease and become uninteresting. I was sorrowfully preparing for this. HOWEVER, The Thousand Orcs was like a blast of fresh air in my face. A fantastic story that continues to build even through the end of the book, coupled with even further character development (perhaps the greatest thing about the Drizzt books is that the characters themselves grow, change, and adapt to the chaotic world) does well to ease your craving for an excellent fantasy read, while opening a huge hole in your stomach that can only be filled with a big bite from the next book, The Lone Drow. I can't wait, cuz I'm starving.
for pete's sake people...: do you have nothing better to do than sit around and write flame reviews as if your opinion should set the course of Salvatore's idea?GO OUTSIDE. Go. That's that big place, on the other side of the door, where all that noise and sunshine comes from.that is all.
WARNING!!! Horrible Book: This book was Salvatore at his worst. Do not buy it. It was really boring until the end and then all Drizzt does is fight a few frost giants. After this Drizzt goes into a berserk rage that lasts for another whole book because he thought that Bruenor died. This attempt to build up tension turns Drizzt into a bloodthirsty instinctive monster for another whole book. All he thinks about is kill orcs, kill orcs, kill orcs.
The Thousand Orcs: You will either love Salvatore's works or you will be luke warm regarding them. There doesn't seem to be any in between. I was flushed with excitement reading and could hardly put down this book. Make plans to have your phone off, your drinks handy and a comfortable chair to finish this book.
Quality and Quantity with Everything you love about R.A.S.: I have to say I have waited a long time for another of RA Salvatore's works from the fantasy realm of the dark elf and he hasn't let me down. I am trying to read this one slowly so I can move right into the sequel without having to wait too long. Drizzt is back in action and kicking some a$$ the way we've all come to love him. The other characters help keep the story interesting and we see a number of characters from other RA tales come into the mix. I always find it intriguing when different stories tie into each other. For example, the Bouldershoulder brothers play a big part in the Cleric Quintet. Amazing quality and a book that will wet your whistle for a while (if you can put it down:-)
Very good Grippy Glove: This is a great glove fits perfectly and comfortably with very good grip to the point that i it was ready to give me a callous on a part of my palm, might try to combate it with some baby powder.
Perfect contact gloves.: Fingers sized perfectly, nice snug fit. Great "contact" gloves, don't expect warmth, they just keep a contact barrier between cold and skin. Great dexterity and sense of touch.
Great for mountain biking: I bought these gloves for mountain biking. They work great. They give you that extra grip when you need it and are lightweight. They are durable and look good as well.
Overall good but not great.: Good gloves comfortable and all they just broke......the cover for the strap kinda just feel off. a Bit diapointed by that, and the fact that ive had warmer gloves before. Overall not bad on a budget, otherwise try something else honestly.
great gloves: I bought this gloves size m and its fits good to my hands but i think that the strech material feels little bit tight...great gloves!! great brand!!
Started coming apart after 3 rides.: I use these gloves with my mountain bike. I have only used them three times: in two 15-kilometer bikes rides and in one 52-kilometer bike ride. A glove is coming apart around the pinky finger. I read so many good reviews which is why I got these gloves, so it really surprised me to see that they were not stitched that good. I like the gloves, but this, to me, is unacceptable.
Great Fox gloves: I've used the gloves on 15 rides now and they don't show any signs of wear. I ride hard, usually 25-35 miles a ride, rain or shine. Medium fits me like they are my own skin; not too much fabric over the wrist. The Velcro strap allows me to cinch up the wrist as tight or as loose as I want. Fast drying and I definitely like the softer fabric on the thumb for wiping my face.And a bargain price.
HFCS: The fact that this has both HFCS and regular corn syrup, along with sugar is a bit disgusting. You can tell HFCS leaves a nasty film all over the inside of your mouth. Pretty much ruins it for me.
Torani caramel syrup: This is one of life's pleasures. My wife uses it every morning in her coffee--a little stirred in and then a drizzle atop the steamed milk. Delicious and worth a few extra calories. Torani's is not available everywhere and even those stores that carry it can't be relied upon to have it available at all times. So finding it on Amazon was wonderful. By setting up a delivery every three months, we got a nifty discount. Now, we never have to worry about finding it in the stores. Thanks, Amazon.
Good for use with the Cafe Frappe: We bought this to use with our newly purchasedMr. Coffee BVMC-FM1 20-Ounce Frappe Maker. It works great for caramel frappes. It tastes pretty good, though it's not quite as good as the stuff that Starbucks uses. However, for the cost for a case of 6 of them, I think it was worth it.
A 10 year old child chould have done better than this!: Not more than 12 words spoken during the entire movie. Absolutely a nothing of a movie. Do not waste your time. Junk
You have to be kidding...: The only conclusion I can come to is that the other reviewers here are friends and relatives of the director, because this stupid amateurish movie is like a bad student film, and I can't believe I actually spent money on it. The cheesey special effects are just thrown in senselessly (a little dead girl jerking and spasming around everwhere) because the director has seen this particular thing in about a hundred other horror films from the last decade and obviously liked it. Ridiculous.
No CD as ordered: When I ordered the book ,I ordered the CD with it but when the book came there wasn't a CD included that I paid for.I would like a CD mailed to me. Thank you.
too wordy, too advance for an intro book: cecie starr, gets mixed up in her own poorly written (and many times, poorly organized) textbook and produces numerous grammatical errors that make her sentences have two meanings, or mean something else that's completely wrong. the textbook uses too many pronouns, like "it" "them" "they" and you end up wasting time finding out what "that" was 2 to three sentences ago. one ends up spending too much time figuring out what she tried to mean, and the logic of her grammar, rather than learning the new material. so you end up reading a chapter over and over again without much help. her pages are jam packed with new and therefore hard concepts to grasp, without much explanation. starr needs an editor big time, especially when it comes to simplifying her complicated and poor writing of the already not so simple concepts of biology to new students. i do not recommend this book (or most of cecie starr's textbooks) to novices, this book is an easy read for bio experts.
Must read...: A friend commented, and I whole-heartedly agree, "there is so much more to Hemingway than the caricature of Hemingway." Amen. This book is beautifully written.
A Problem Of Pendulous Americana Amongst Noble People: Laurie Lee told me that he had met Ernest Hemingway. Whether or not it was during the Spanish Civil War or not, I don't recall. What I remember most is his acidulous critique of the blundering All-American dolt who thinks he is the only one who can sort it out...He remembered great Paul Robeson, who will always be remembered( -I take it that many correspondents already take me as black.) Robeson was a great follower in battle, a great propagandist, and therefore a great warrior.Lee railed , in his inimical Gloucestershire, about 'The Big Cowboy' who thought he could lead these tender men to battle. He was kind, to the point of sheer tenderness, about Hemingway as a supporter of the people's great struggle, but he always saw him as impossibly arrogant, (I think), as a forerunner of today's all too cowboyish thickhead, who could I be thinking of?
Powerhouse: The book is an extraordinary narration of a chapter in the appalling Spanish Civil War. Hemingway bestowed a stern stare to an almost missing chapter of the American history and its involvement in the international brigades. Hemingway collates in a subtle and almost ironic fashion all the emotions of human nature: bravery, love, wrath, fear. The book induces the reader to become a mute witness of this sensational drama illustrated deliciously by the author. Easy to read and quite difficult to forget.
I man's gota' do, what I man's gota' do: Hemingway has a way of getting into our heads. The characters are plain spoken; almost Shakespearean at times; with powerful, philosophical paragraphs sprayed in. His interest in bullfighting is obvious if you have read any of his work; and is not ignored here. Against the rules of writing he uses the Spanish tongue; although irritating, he gets away with it.Set in the mid 1930's, and centered around an American munitions expert fighting to help the cause of removing the Germans, Italians, and the rest of the fascist armies from out of Spain. He links up with a group of cave dwelling partisans outside of town. Much of the book is spent on his relationship with this group and him falling in love with a young girl, whom he can never have.Some may object to the ending, but I found it fitting; "I man's gota' do, what I man's gota' do"Wish you wellScott
For Whom The Bells Toll: Good read. The main characters in the book are almost alive. Robert, Maria and Pilar keep the dialog alive but in some cases the details are too extensive. Hard to not keep reading each night to find out what happens to Robert and Maria and, of course, the bridge. Hemmingway is a favorite.
Hemingway Knows what He's Talking About: As a 15-year-old high school student, being reccomended to read one of the longest books for summer reading wasn't all too appealing to me. Now that I have read the book, I'm glad that I chose to read For Whom the Bell Tolls. It is a great book if you want to get the perspective of a foreigner in another country fighting a war. Being very interested in history myself, learning about the Spanish Civil War was quite intriguing. Hemingway was very good in expressing his feelings about the war in the country which he once lived. Although the middle of the book can, at times, be quite a drag, the rest of the book was very enjoyable. The war/action scenes in the story were very well written by Hemingway. After reading this book, I look forward to reading more Hemingway novels in the future. If you want to read a war story, I fully reccomend reading For Whom the Bell Tolls.
It's what's not said: Great ending...left to the imagination of the reader. Hemmingway does that a lot in this book. Lays down a scene, but does not complete it. Lets the reader imagine how it plays out.Very accessible book. Puts the reader into the scenes with excellent, very detailed descriptions. And the characters are human...not perfect...not overdone.Quick summary: An American spanish teacher from Montana is engaged to contribute to the Spanish civil war effort by bombing a bridge. He recruits a randy band of freedom fighters who are hiding out in a cave to assist. In the four days leading up to the bombing, he makes friends, makes enemies, falls in love, and eventually gets the job done, even though in the end he's not sure how he's contributing to the cause.
It tolls for anyone who has to read this boring book: I just can't get with Hemingway, and I have trudged through five or six of his allegedly best works. This one as usual has a boring plot, characters that you can't possibly care about, and dull prose. A real yawner. Would very many people think he was great if they hadn't been told that every day of their lives by their high school English teachers?
hemingway: this book was broing to me only because i didnt understand it well. i think it has a mature taste to it. if i was a little older i think i would have appreciated it a lot more. i read it for a 9th grade english class and it was not of my choice. it was boring went on and on for too long
If you're smart, you'll toll the bell on this novel!: I guess the simple truths of Ernest Hemmingway were just a bit too simple for me.
Tepid, Macho, Romantic *Crap*: Simply put, this book, and Hemmingway in general, is overrated. There is nothing unexpected in the prose nor storyline, just a typical page-turner or "best seller" -- and that is *not* a compliment! Lacking in any real insight and imagination, Hemmingway is more like a modern-day Stephen King or Amy Tan or any other writer who sells their soul for the sake of popularity.
overrated: Hemingway will be remembered as the Lord Byron of the 20th century; vastly overrated, woefully untalented.
Blah: Hemingway was a grreat promoter of himself. A lot of bull. This book is a rambling piece of blige. Hemingwasy was a good writer, but not all (and I should say most of) his books are dull as ditch water. This is a perfect example of dull writing. His "personal property" was bull fighting and the Spanish Civil war...give me a break. If this thing tells you anything about the civil war you are too dumb to be counted. Hemingway is ok, but come on, hardly the "Great Writer of the 20th century" that he wants us to believe. Talk about great publicity, this guy had it in spades. The bells just don't toll. But what can you expect from someone who commits suicide. A coward. Skip this one.
for whom the bell tolls: the book is censored ! not original text , should be removed, and replaced with the un-edited original version. why are altered books being sold ?
Pretty good: I very much enjoyed this book, it is not one of my favorites, but I am very happy I read it. I recommend it for people who enjoy Ernest Hemingway as a writer, but if you are new to him, I would do a little bit of research on this book before deciding to read it.
For Whom the Bell Tolls. by Ernest Hemingway.: The book is very wordy with lengthy sentences that are are unnecessary for continuity of the plot. Even taking exception for the fact that it is taking place during war, I find that it is quite brutal. I do not find it enjoyable.
Let Down: F. Scott Fitzgerald himself said of this novel: "It has all the profundity of REBECCA." REBECCA being a sleight novel. This book reads like a 2nd-rate journalist's attempt at writing a novel. It lacks the subtlety of Hemingway's other novels. I love Hemingway. But I didn't love this book.
Not all it's cracked up to be.: I was excited to read my first Hemmingway book. I labored through the extremely cumbersome and boring narratives hoping that eventually it would pay off, unfortunately it never did. I know it's fiction and everything but the way Hemmingway has Pilar describe past events for pages and pages is very unrealistic. The book finally gets good about 34 Chapters into it whith the raid on El Sordo's band which is the highlight of the book. Maria is annoying. The narrative is confusing. If you are looking for a classic I recommend skipping this book. I plan on reading "The Old Man and the Sea" next. Hopefully Hemmingway will redeem himself in that book. I honestly do not see why people consider this a classic. It was a waste of time.
Not too impressed.: I listened to this on audio book over several days, it felt like forever. I wasn't too impressed. It was slow, slow, and did I mention slow. Then when it was interesting, it wasn't even worth all the slowness. Won't be sampling Hemingway again anytime soon.
the emperor has no clothes: Someone has to say it, the supposed emperor has no clothes. hemingway was known to be a legend in his own mind and apparently attracted a cult following. for me, this book was a terrible disappointment; i feel cheated by the author's reputation, which seems undeserved. it's sad if the arbiters of quality in American literature view Hemingway as some kind of icon. i voraciously read more books than i can ever count, starting out as a literature major in college and now it's 40 years later. for whom the bell tolls is mind numbing for the most part with a plot that barely moves, does not stimulate the imagination, and makes a rather ordinary point overall. the dialog is mostly rather odd, shallow and unrevealing. Except for the character of Pilar, who vividly and viscerally recounts instances of the brutality of man against man (and woman and animal, especially during con flict, the other characters are not well developed. I cannot recommend this book at all.
Couldn't be bothered: I spend about half my life reading - I've read almost all the books which would fall under the heading 'classic' so I think that qualifies me somewhat to say that, in my opinion, this book was just SOOOOO DULL. I couldn't get into it at all and laboured right to the halfway point before finally deciding that if I continued any further I would most certainly expire of boredom. After reading all the rave reviews I feel as though I read a different book to everyone else. Give me Steinbeck any day but forget Hemingway.
age and Hemingway: If you are a teenager You should not read Hemingway. You will not understand it. If your teacher makes you,She/he is a fool.
Hemmingway's Best: Hemmingway is amazing, completly captivating the reader with his beutifuly descriptive sentences. My all time favorite book
Patient Perfection: This is Hemingway at his best. This story develops rather patiently, but every sentence is a jewel. The story itself could probably be a short, however Hemingway insists that we live through the fear, love, and pain step by step, day by day, hour by hour . . . and, of course, it works. The power and beauty of this story truly lays in the journey.
To whom it may concern: What can I say? He is so scant of description but so full of story. I read his books over and over about his war stories. They almost aren't war stories but preludes to battle where the battle is almost inconsequencial. You are already a conrade of the character. You just lost a friend.
Plodding plotting: I entered this book thinking highly of Hemingway, having read some of the Nick Adams stories as well as The Old Man and the Sea. But Bell is quite a disappointment. The 1930s-era characters seem to be speaking an off-putting and unwieldy gringo Shakespeare ("Thou hast crossed the arroyo, Ingles"). Moreover, the revolving themes of duty and honor and the instrument of war / administration vs. the individuals who carry out the specific deeds don't seem to develop. Rather, the reader is subject to endless conversations with rather boring people, then Robert Jordan muses in an unenlightening manner upon the conversations he's had. About 1/3 of the way through the book I was thinking "just blow the damn bridge up, make love to Maria, and go home." Having skimmed the Cliffs Notes, apparently it takes a few hundred more pages for that to happen; pages I am unwilling to read.
Boring Hemingway I'm upset: I love Hemingway, but this book bored me to tears. I'll concede that I watched the movie first and knowing the ending took some of the fun out of it. Go read A Moveable Feast. You can always come back to this one later.
Hatred for changes: I do enjoy the book. My issue is not with the book but with the people who altered it to suit their sensibility. If you don't like the langauge used in the book that is fine, but don't change every curse word to "unprintable", "unmentionable" because you and want you and your children to live in a bubble. You are ruining something that is perfect as it is. You lack the creative ability to create anything on your own so you believe changing curse words into clever terms makes you an artist. Whoever edited this book need be shot, and be sent back to whatever community college academic standpoint they came from where they believe the world is fair and things should all be politically correct.NEVER CHANGE THINGS TO SUIT YOUR SENSIBILITY!
A Hemingway-fan should love it: This book is about an American, Robert Jordan, who joins the Republican Army (communists) to fight the nationalists during the civil war in Spain in the 1930's. He joins a guerilla-group which is given the mission to blow up a bridge to obstruct the fascists' offensive. Although he has a bad feeling about the whole situation he persists.I found the character pilar the most interesting, fulfilling a key role of telling the background story (her experience in the war sofar) as well as being the one who keeps the whole group together (her insights give the American, Robert Jordan, some information about Pablo, the member of the group who can't be trusted).Although it has bothered a lot of people (read the other reviews), for me the translated Spanish words and little sentences really added something to the atmosphere of the book as well as to a better depiction of the characters.
Powerful, enthralling, heartbreaking: No book has had as powerful an effect on me as this one. I have never read as effective a treatment of loyalty; love; fear; courage. When I reached the last page, after Jordan's injury forces him to leave his love Maria to carry on and he must await his death from the pursuing Fascists, he lies in the pine-scented forest (I can still smell it), lining up his rifle on the leader of the soldiers, the pine-needles pricking through his shirt as he lay, he waited for the officer to enter the sunlit area ... when I read this I wept. A tremendous, heartstopping novel.
A truly wonderful book: This is one of Hemmingway's best. It is about war, love, and the endless fight for the opportunity to be human. It has a heartwarming love story that is beautiful without degenerating into a sappy Danielle Steele novel. Perhaps the main thrust of the book can be summed up in one of is most famous lines: "The world is a fine place and worth fighting for and I hate very much to leave it." For those who grow weary of 20th century novels that are driven by stream-of-consciousness and herky-jerky narrative, they will find Hemmingway's straightforward, lucid yet eloquent prose quite refreshing. This is a very well done book for the ages.
this book is great, one of the best classics i've read: i first read this book in 7th grade. it was the first hemmingway i read. my english teacher was surprised that i could read a 600 pager in a day. this is one of the best classics i've read.
Extraordinary writing rarely seen today: I recently read For Whom the Bell Tolls for a book group and absolutely loved it. The writing is superb. I think I especially enjoyed the parts of the book where the characters are describing their thoughts in tremendous detail, particularly how they feel about having to die at that time in that place. It's extremely dramatic in its depth. The ending is tragic and brought tears to my eyes, even though I already knew what happened.
Brutal truth: This is a story about how simultaneously precious and arbitrary life can be at the same time. Hemingway tells us through his work that ultimately, our brief moment in the sun is nothing more than a chance to do something special and worthwhile, and it is up to us to seize the moment or let it pass. For Whom the Bell Tolls reads far better than The Sun Also Rises, and even though the settings are completely different, I think the same themes about hard-edged valor come through in both. Feminist attempts to emasculate Hemingway (as in other reviews here) seem rather cynical and pointless to me. I enjoyed this book very much. Hemingway has some profound things to say about life. You may not find the bitter message politically correct, but the truth has a way of being enlightening even if unpopular.
While not the best Hemingway...: ...this book aims to please those readers of Spanish novels with American themes. Give this a read.
Spanish American war: The political passions that drove Spain to the brink and over the brink of national insanity have almost been forgotten now, but Hemingway's great novel of those times remains. Both fascism and communism have been consigned to the ash heap of history, but we still get here some sense of how the people of that nation were clawing at each other for barely understood reasons. Hemingway's handling of his material is almost beyond praise; it's a genuinely great novel, and a full workout of his trademark and massively influential prose style. The only flaw is the character of Maria and the instantaneous love affair the author cooks up between this refugee and the American interloper Robert Jordan. Amidst the dramatic and desperate events of the story it just doesn't ring true. I would rate this Hemingway's second best novel, after "The Sun Also Rises."
A powerful novel...: Hemingway used his experiences as a journalist during the Spanish Civil War to build the structure for this novel. His descriptions of the settings are superb. The novel is a great introduction to the Spanish Civil War, a war with which many Americans are unfamiliar. Hemingway used characters like Pablo to show how people lose their humanity during war. The story is powerful. His main character, Robert Jordan, begins to question whether anything good will come of all the fighting.Despite its many wonderful attributes, this novel has some problems. The dialogue is stilted. The romance (as in all Hemingway novels) is unbelievable. Finally, Hemingway should have stuck to English. His use of Spanish in this book is embarassing.Nonetheless, in my opinion, For Whom the Bell Tolls should be required reading for all U.S. high school students. It's truly a classic.
For Whom The bell Tolls: I thought that this book was very good. Ernest Hemingway was very clear and you were able to even picture how it was in the war. I would recomend this book to everyone. It was sad and funny, and that is a good combination. I think that it had a very good ending and it was very well written.
Like a dusty jacket in the corner hall. . .: this book reminds me again what is real. Hemingway really was a truth fanatic. He purged pretense and falsity so nearly completely in this book, I put it down and walk outside
Censored: If you want to read an award-winning author's works, do not read this edition. It is censored to remove the profanity by usning the words "unprintable" repeatedly. Very insulting to any reader. If young people can't handle such vocabulary, they should stick with "The Adventures of Barney."
One of the Best Historical Novel's I've Read...: Yes, I said "historical novel," because, even in H.'s day, history passed by very quickly. It's this novel A Farewell to Arms, and The Old Man and the Sea that, for me, are the real crown jewels of Hemingway's output. Even if you're just interested in the historical aspect of the The Spanish Civil War, you'll get much out of this work. There isn't much more I can add that hasn't already been said.
Really, really tedious: It took me far too long to struggle my way through this novel. Hemingway's attempts to capture the flavor of Spanish syntax make the narrative sound artificial and, at times, ludicrous. Furthermore he often had characters engage in lengthy exchanges which would resolve into nothing, leaving the reader to wonder what profound point he missed. When, in fact, there really was no point at all.Overly long and arduous. Something to be foisted upon unhappy high-schoolers. Hemingway's just not the sort whose style appeals to.
I Obscenity In The Milk Of....Aw, Muck It.: The plot, characters, etc. have all been discussed ad infinitum around here. Let's just say I was looking forward to my first Hemingway book. It took me three months to get through it. I'll read another one, but if it's anything like this one, maybe Ernie isn't for me.
excelsior!: must be where Metallica got the song name from. Anyways this is one of but many authors that, like Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain decided to take the easy way out. In the meantime he penned this great literature that is a great book. I don't care what anybody says, the old man and the sea is boring and short and so with that I bid you good day and happy reading!
A Bit Slow For Me: I want to offer a little dissent here. I thought the book to be a bit dull and slow. I really labored to get through it and becuase of it completely turned me off to the rest of his work. It could be that I spend too much time reading action fiction so I need a fast paced book to keep me interested.
Worth waiting for!: Many years ago, I read Van Lustbader's Dai-san trilogy and thought...this guy should stick to thrillers. He has a knack. But then his thrillers became stale and formulaic. He has re-invented himself as a writer with the Pearl series, of which, this is the third installment.Kundala rivals Raymond E. Feist's Midkemia. It is a land of the usual fantasy novel with high-tech thrown in. It's a well-done blend. Characters are well-developed and the dialogue is, at times, highly entertaining....way beyond the usual. These characters have senses of humour, bad days and good ones.Given the ending, it's likely we will see more of this world and I can hardly wait.
Ah, The Founders...: In an age where too many voters are "pre-enlightenment", this is a great read to reminder us where we came from.
The Federalist Papers: I read The Federalist Papers both in High School and College. I felt I needed to read the book again given the political noise we are hearing. It is a must for any voter interested in making a reasoned choice between the political candidates at all levels who claim to understand the constitution!
Required Reading: I had to purchase this book to read for school. It is interesting to see the history of what was taking place around the time our Constitution was adopted and the politics at work during that time. This gives context to the study of our Constitution.
Thoroughly Satisfied: The book showed earlier than expected and was in the great shape it was supposed to be in.
Bible must be verboten too!: If Wilder Publishing put this type of warning on the Federalist Papers & the Constitution one can only wonder what kind of warning must they put on the Bible? Or would they even publish it? Perhaps as a paperback novel?
Utterly appalling.: I could never buy from a publisher who puts warning labels on our nation's founding documents. May they go out of business very soon!!
Mistake or Bait & Switch?: I wanted the Federalist Papers, edited by Clinton Rossiter. Found it in a paperback edition (Signet Classics) on the Amazon website. Amazon price, $7.95. Not bad, but the same web page lists Kindle Edition for $0.99. Trouble is, the Kindle edition is not the same edition! The Kindle edition is The Federalist Papers, all right, but with a different editor and from a different publisher.This is either an honest mistake because Amazon can't differentiate between editions of works in the public domain, or it is a bait & switch, where you think you are getting a particular edition of a text but you receive something different on your Kindle.Luckily, it only requires a couple keyclicks to return a Kindle book. Now I can go buy the paperback edition at Powell's.As this was my first purchase for my new Kindle Paperwhite, we are not off to a great start!
THE FEDERALIST PAPERS: GREAT REFERENCE WORK. MANY MORE SUCH REFERENCE BOOKS SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE, AND UNIVERSITY POST GRADUATE STUDENTS.
The Federalist Papers - Alexander Hamilton: The Federalist Papers - Alexander HamiltonExcellent, should be required reading by all High School and College students. Congress should be tested on this text.
BOYCOTT WILDER PUBLISHING: This publisher thought the need to put a WARNING LABEL on the CONSTITUTION of the UNITED STATES, as well as other federal documents of this time, which I personally feel is NOT in the best interest of this country and this WARNING LABEL had no purpose. This company wanted to DISTANCE itself from the protections it provides. SO BE IT! I will make an effort to NOT purchase anything published by this company EVER, no matter if it means that I miss reading from a favorite author. I will be researching if any of my favorite authors have books published by them, and writing emails to them to voice my concerns to them also!
Disgusting: This is disturbing. This is an obvious example of the joke that has become the United States of America. This is the begining of the end of our Constitution and our Country. When will AMERICAN Citizens open their eyes and see what is happening?????? I will definitely boycott all produts from this publisher.
Disgusting Disclaimer!: I will NOT buy a copy from this publisher - who feels the need to apologize for the contents of this great work!!What a disgusting disclaimer - That the founding documents of our Country do "not reflect the same values as it would if it were writtten today?" Which values would THAT be?Our Founding Documents are what made this country the most free, most prosperous, most desirable (don't see a lot of people trying to sneak IN to Mexico, Cuba, Russia, China, North Korea, do you?)country in the world, and they apologize for them???!!!!I will carefully check for their name on anything I buy - and make sure I buy from someone else!Maybe the publishers should set up shop somewhere that "reflects" their own values better than the United States of America. I wish them luck with that!Hypocrites!
Garbage: Liberals hate america. They're preachings will poison the youths of this nation through the use of The Federalist Papers. Avoid this book at all costs and boycott the company for making an unbiased warped view of our nation.
Great material, horrid typeface: I will not even comment on the material itself, other than to say that it is superb. However, the print quality is so poor as to merit only two stars. It is much worse than "newsprint," on roughly 20 pages of my copy, over a quarter of the page is virtually unreadable, the text is so light. The only reason this book merited two stars was its superb notes, illuminating some of the more perplexing aspects of the book. However, I would not recommend this particular copy unless found at a bookstore (sorry, Amazon) where the quality of the print can be evaluated.
No BUY: This book has been altered to include a WARNING label on the front page. The Constitution of the United States of America DOES NOT get a warning label. I wouldn't recommend this book or any other book published by this company. Please BOYCOTT for their Anti-American act they have engaged in.
A Must Read: I have this in two versions of this app and a hardback. Our kids 8-16 are using these for schooling in American History.
federalist papers: THE FEDERALISTS PAPERS is a must read for those who wish to know how a Republic works.
A good timely read: Reading the Federalist Papers at a time of impeachment hearings, trails, and sound bites can give you the insight into how the Founding Fathers attempted to "sell" or "spin" the need for a Federal government to the contemporaries.Reading it will also allow you to see through all of the pundits and politicians who profess to be following the founders intent and quote Madison and Hamilton but have never realy bothered to actually read their words.
Hamilton would blush: To put the nations most important thinking in such a cheesy cover is a real shame. It would embarass the authors. But alas the Papers are the Papers. They are an explosion of Enlightenment thinking and can thus enhance and enliven anyones understanding of the nation's founding and nations' many current predicaments.
Pro-corporate: "Federal", as in "federation" and "league", relates to commercial entities and commercial contract. Keep in mind, the United States is not a country but a corporation with no jurisdiction outside it's "ten mile square" district and the 18 enumerated functions of Congress Assembled (aka The United States).
Horrible....: (In case you don't already know, this company has a put a warning on the documents that founded our country, saying that these documents don't really mean what they say.) The people who would put a warning on some of the most important documents of our history, that we should still be following today, are not the kind of people I would want to give my money to. This document is not hazardous to your health, only to the health of big, bloated governments that step on the rights of the people. Don't buy this company's publications.
Tearing down our nation: I rate this one of five stars due to its blatant manner of trying to provide commentary to the youth of America on personal views and preferences that are contrary to our nation's founding documents (if possible, it would be a zero). Without a doubt, the leftist tendencies of many in our nation are the surest threat to our survival as a free nation. And while I have defended our great nation for twenty-nine years of active military service, I sometimes am amazed at the fact that I must also defend these types of unpatriotic attacks on our own nation. I encourage no one to buy this product. Sorry, Amazon, but this publisher has gone too far.
Usefule Idiots: The publisher of this work somehow feels the need to place a warning label with it. What is so harmful or potetially harmful in the Constitution of the United States of America? Kruschev said the communists would destroy us without ever firing a shot and Lenin spoke of useful idiots. In my humble opinion, guaranteed the light of day by the Consititution, these people are who Kruschev and Lenin spoke of back in the day. Boycott all of their publications. There are plenty of places to buy copies of the Constitution without supporting an apologist, revisionist, propogandist publishing company.
Should be Required Reading for Everyone: Anyone wanting to have a true understanding of the founding intent and framework of the United States needs to read The Federalist Papers. This version is economical and serves the purpose. You will not get this much value out of any constitutional law course!!
PC at it's worse: Placing a disclaimer on the Federalist Papers is unbelievable. It's their right of course, but it's our right to protest and to NOT BUY.Thank you.
5 stars for THE classic of American political philosophy BUT....: ...please boycott Wilder Publications edition,there are many others to choose from. Why? Well,check out the disclaimer Wilder has stuck onto the words of Madison, Hamilton and Jay, thereby earning one star:"This book is a product of its time and does not reflect the same values as it would if it were written today. Parents might wish to discuss with their children how views on race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and interpersonal relations have changed since this book was written before allowing them to read this classic work."Yup. The Federalist now merits a warning label. The young cannot be trusted not to draw dangerous conclusions from the subversive, dangerous ideas therein, such as limited government, checks and balances, constrained judicial review,dual sovereignty of states and federal government, and deliberative democracy.
Unbelievable Orwelians: I will boycott any product of this company. Their disclaimer is outrageous, ludicrous and malicious. We the people must put them out of business.
A stripped down edition the The Federalist Papers: Given my inexorably advancing age, my eyes are not what they used to be. I therefore welcome this version of "The Federalist Papers" in that while not a "large print" edition, the print IS larger and easier to read than elsewhere.The book is of good quality and I expect it to last at least as long as me. The only reason I gave this edition four stars instead of five is that there is absolutely NO commentary. Many may declare this a feature and not a bug. However, new as I am to the actual text of these famous essays, a little guidance (if only a simple introduction) may have been helpful.That said, there is endless commentary available from other sources including readily accessible material on the internet so this really isn't a problem.I wanted a quality, hard copy edition of these essays and I got it.Enjoy.
Required Reading: In addition to required reading for a majority of college work, it should be required reading for every voter. THIS IS HOW OUR FOUNDING FATHER WANTED IT TO WORK!
very interesting....but: for me this was a difficult read. reading this in the paper must had been a nightmare for the average citizen of New York back then. Though these three men were very literate they seemed to know every piece of punctuation but the period. Way too many run on sentences for me. Take a breath already.john
Nice for people with vision issues: Nice large print for people who are farsighted or just want to read something that's not in an itty-bitty typeface. :-)
Classic and basis for American political theory!: The combination of these three authors and their complete, unabridged works is amazing. ONline editions of their works are cumbersome and in general, not as handy as this paperback.
These Documents Need a Warning?: These historic documents deserve 5 stars and every American should read them. Wilder Publishing deserves zero stars. The packaging includes a warning that "This book is a product of its time and does not reflect the same values as it would if it were written today. Parents might wish to discuss with their children how views on race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and interpersonal relations have changed since this book was written before allowing them to read this classic work." See for yourself in the preview. Wilder publishing should be completely shunned for this insult to the founding fathers. What point are they trying to get across? Why publish these great works only to invalidate them with a warning that they are outdated. Shameful!
broken binding/ pages printed at an angle: Binding was broken. Pages were printed on an angle and falling out of book.However, Amazon was excellent (& prompt) with their return policy.
Federalist Papers first copy.: This is the book I ordered. However the binding was bad in that the pages would fall out of the book. I returned it and requested another copy. The replacement copy had the same problem. I seperated out all of the pages, got a three-ring binder, punched holes in the loose pages and inserted them into the binder. Works great.
Not For Study Use: This edition of the Federalist Papers lacks margin and header space for notes. Additionally, the typeface is small and lines too close together to make easy to read--I had to use a ruler to track my reading.Don't buy this edition if your goal is to use it for study!
A useful reference on my smartphone: I already own several paper books with full texts of the Federalist Papers, but I wanted a handy reference available on my smart phone. The full text of the papers are available online, but I find it much more convenient to use this e-book version. I haven't used this particular version extensively yet, but it seems well laid out.
An Immigrant For America: When I heard about this disclaimer, I was disgusted. These are the principles upon which this Nation was founded and which have provided this country and citizens Liberties which do not exist elswhere. This Nation's promise of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness is why my parents brought us here from Cuba. I am proud to be an American and proud of the vision and documents that made this Nation great. SHAME ON YOU!
Remarks: I have not finshed the total as of yet. But, so far it appears to be a great policitic piece for the the people to vote for the new goverment.
Do all their books on history & politics have such warnings?: I'm sure they have no problem with books like the Communist Manifesto or Mao's Little Red Book.Thank you Wilder for telling us how you really feel about the principles this country was founded on.
Oh, the Irony!: This has to be some sort of demented joke from a former literary student, now stuck in the bowels of Wilder's editing department. That anyone would think to put a disclaimer of potential political incorrectness on the Constitution of the United States, the document that above any other seeks to ensure fair treatment and dignity for all Americans, is just...It has to be a joke. I refuse to believe I am not being punked.
Shameful disclaimer: The words of our Founding Fathers have traversed over 200 years of history relatively unsullied. Until now.To say that I am shocked by this pointless disclaimer is a terrible understatement.By all means, read the Federalist Papers, but do not support these simpletons. They are unworthy of the great Nation that we share.
Kindle edition November, 27, 2010. A rip-off.: The format in a Kindle DX is awful, unreadable. Lines of different lengths, with one or two words, words broken at random points... Don't waste your money on this, it is just a pity that Kindle users do not get the respect they deserve. Buy this on paper or do not buy it at all.
What a disgrace: How ironic that this publisher puts a disclaimer on these documents, books and papers. The action of the content is what gives them the ability to publish them.
The publisher trashed this great work.: The publishers should be ashamed of themselves... the publishers truly are America hatersfor trashing this great work via disclaimer.
Arrogance At Its Best!: How arrogant that this publisher feels the need to put a disclaimer on what he/she deems to be politically incorrect.The disclaimer from this publisher is offensive and repulsive. How much longer will we support these people who are progressively doing all they can to dismantle and destroy the things that hold this country together? I read alot and buy most of my books from Amazon. I will no longer purchase any materials from this publisher whether they contain a disclaimer or not! I will make it a point to share with my friends who are avid readers as well.
BOYCOTT WILDER PUBLICATIONS: WILDER PUBLICATIONS YOU FEEL THE CONTENTS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE DECLERATION OF INDEPENDENCE MAY BE OFFENSIVE WELL I FIND YOUR STANCE ON THIS OFFENSIVE AND WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING PUBLISHED BY YOUR COMPANY, FURTHERMORE I WILL EMAIL EVERYBODY I KNOW INFORMING THEM OF YOUR DECISION TO PUT WARNING LABELS ON THE CONSTITUTION AND THE DECLERATION OF INDEPENDENCE. THE NERVE OF YOUR COMPANY TELLING THE PUBLIC THAT THESE DOCUMENTS MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE!!!
Bad Printing, Bad Binding, Bad Book, Bad Service: 1) The pages are falling out,2) the glue is visible,3) the pages are rough and of different lengths,4) the print runs at an angle,5) some sentences are cut off at the bottom of the page,6) pictures of low resolution adorn the cover and first pages.Amazon has not responded to emails.Ten dollars? Really.
As Pertinent Today As Then: For those who wish to know what the Founders were concerned about at the time of Ratifying the Constitution this is a must read. I am amazed at how relative it is to the argument today of the Constitution being abused. The writers of The Federalist Papers were exceptional men who truly cared about Personal Liberty, States Rights and the role of The Federal Government. An insight I will appreciate always!
Americans should read this: If you think you understand American constitutions rights and thought, you can't be sure unless this book is in your reading (and there are others, of course). Read this (I have the soft-bound version). Learn how little of the constitution is actually practiced today. Don't be too surprised when you find out that, when defined by the thoughts in this book, we no longer follow our constitution except for a few logistical practices, like trial by jury. In fact, read the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, and learn how our nation no longer functions by these documents in the final analysis. We no longer live in a Republic except by name.
Awful Quality Book: As soon as I flipped the first few pages, they began to fall out. Buy a different version, not this flimsy one that is of horrible quality
Beware the library binding: I was looking for a high-quality gift book for a big fan of the Constitution. What I got was a small-format (basic Penguin trade paperback) book crammed with small-font text, small margins, already-yellowing paper and an austere red binding with no jacket. All for a premium price.Look for another, less expensive version. Any other version.
Seminal work in all of history: Most would say, "all of US history."No, these writings transcend continent and century. These papers are singularly important in the scope of human history.Sure, the writing is dry by modern standards. I don't talk this way; neither does anyone else I know.Just take the time to understand. It's worth the effort.
Great book: I found this book educational and informative. Would recommend it to anyone. A must have for anyone interested In American history.
Poor quality: I have never seen a book more poorly made. The pages were glued into the book in such a way that when you opened up to a page, a portion of the text was not readable because it was glued to the previous page.Also, I paid $15.95 for this book and when I received it the price printed on the book was $9.95. Usually Amazon gives you better prices than you can find elsewhere, but they actually charged 50% more for this book than the original asking price. Amazon gave me no problem returning this book and immediately gave me a full refund.
The Federalist Papers: This is one of the three or four most important books in English published since 1776. All candidates for federal office should be required to pass a comprehensice essay exam on the Federalist Papers.Applicants for citizenship should be tested on this book.
Shame on Wilder Publishing: I am appalled that a publishing company would put such a ridiculous disclaimer on a publication of the founding documents of the United States of America. Buy from another publisher.
Better in our forefathers time: Thought it would be interesting to read what our forefathers wrote that got this nation started. Too wordy in an archaic way for me to continue past the first few pages.
U. S. Constitution: I will never buy a book from Wilder Publication for its disclaimer that the Constitution is "no longer a valid way of thinking." What? Have you lost your mind(s)?The only reason I gave this site 1 star is a "rating" is required before I can "send." Otherwise, it would have gotten a zero.
A Disclaimer??? Get real Wilder...: Wilder, may you crash and burn at the earliest possible convenience. You disgust me with your trashing of the documents of our Founding Fathers. GFY.Sincerely,TGW
A necessity to understanding the founder's intent: This is a good edition of the Federalist Papers, the introduction by Gary Wills is excellent. However, I would strongly recommend purchasing the Mentor edition, as that edition contains the text of the Constitution, as does this edition, but the Mentor edition has cross-references to specific portions of the Federalist Papers which address that clause of the Constitution.In general the Federalist Papers is a must read, no matter what edition you use, for anyone interested in the founding of the US, or desiring to learn how our system of federalism, and separation of powers was intended to work. I recommend reading numbers 10, 49, and 78 first.
DISGUSTING BOYCOTT LANGUAGE!!!: 'Nuff said.

Ah, the good old days....: Listen up you manly man (and you know who you are); this is a red-blooded tale of fightin, drinkin, wenchin, shootin, drinkin and more fightin. Double-crosses, triple-crosses, self-hate, back - stabbing, moral quandry/schmoral quandry!! Brother, our hero and anti-hero are sweaty, pummeling sailormen with a lust for loot, women, power, immortality and death. By my calculations they go through 4-5 bottles of gin (straight) every day in this novel. Plus they plant haymakers on each other and just about anyone else who comes near on a near hourly basis. Also by my count they are now completely out of teeth. Wow, such a rousing tale. Hey - I got an idea: read it aloud to your girlfriend!
This is wanna be death row material.: This Album was put together by Ms. Lydia Harris, the wife of michael harry-o harris who claims he funded death row records. Interesting cd.
remarkable: "Black Women in White America" is outstanding. Naturally the book provides some remarkable documents about slavery, but there is so much more covered in this fabulous book. The experiences of African - American women seeking to get (and give) an education, the experiences of African-American women as mere sex objects (and their stories of being objectified by men of all races), the crusade against lynching ... I was floored by the variety and amount of sources contained in this book. It is quite comprehensive in its breadth and scope.As a historian and teacher, this is a marvelous resource. As a student and American, it is a moving true-life story that is regretfully often untold. Highly recommended reading.
An excellent documentary on the black women's lives: This book does an excellent job of documenting the lives of African American women from slavery to the 20th century. It gives a portrayal of their strong abilities to move forward, their religious faith, and their degree of hope and self-pride in the meantime. I sincerely recommend this book to everyone in hopes that it will serve as a guide in their present lives.
Great Product!: My 6 month old had outgrown his infant bathtub and so I searched for something that would allow him to sit and play safely. I looked at bath seats and other tubs, but liked this one. We've kept it inflated since we got it (two months ago) and have not had a problem. It has a handy drain and a suction cup to hang it on the wall in between baths. It did have that strong plastic smell at first (like all blow up toys/pools), but I just aired it out for a few days before using it. My little guy loves it and I love not having to worry about the hard sides of the tub. Also not having to fill up the whole tub saves on the water bill!
Good for travel: When traveling, hate to put daughters in other bathtubs - this work's good! Easy to blow up and compact to fold-up and put in suitcase. You can take it no matter you are traveling.
a must have item: I love this product. I always felt my daughter was going to slip away from me in the big tub this fits perfectly in the tub and she's safe the trouble now is getting her out.
Bath time is fun again!: I used to love giving my daughter a bath when she was a newborn...it was so easy! Then as she started to become mobile, it was a little less fun - for me anyway! I got this tub when she was about 4 months old and I haven't looked back (she's now 14 months). It's SO much easier to wash her hair since she has something soft to lean back on. I'm also a bit paranoid about germs and it makes me feel more comfortable that she's in a tub that only she uses (vs. the whole family). It's wonderful to take on trips (especially to hotels...yuk), but just remember to bring a hand pump. Also, we're having a water shortage now in GA and this uses so much less water than filling the whole bathtub. Can't say enough about this product!
A great concept: The Snug-Tub is great because you don't have to fill up the bath tub. My 7 month old loves it. The only concern I have is that she is very active in the tub and the bottom is quite slippery. I must have my hand on her at all times. So what we do now is I place the bath seat in the Snug Tub and let her play. When she is all done I take the seat out and rinse her off in the Snug Tub.
BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT buy this product!!!!!!!!!!!!! The tub is made of PVC vinyl which is also known as the "poison plastic". PVC is NOT a safe material. Please read up on PVC and it's effects on the human body if you aren't sure about it. I think you will be blown away by what you read. I contacted the company and they said that this tub meets government regulations. Unbelievable that the government doesn't insist that companies use safer materials for the children and the environment.
Great.....for a short while: We bought this tub 3 months ago for our 6 month old daughter. It was great until it developed a slow leak on a seam. We would just have to re-inflate it a bit before each use, but now it won't even make it through one bath. Since it had only been 3 months, I called Amazon to see if they would replace it. Amazon told me I needed to contact the manufacturer, Kelgard. When I contacted them I was told to contact Amazon. So bottom line is no one seems to want to send us a replacement. It is great until it leaks. Is sure seems like we should have gotten more than 3 months use from it!
nice and compact!: This tub is great if you dont want to confine your child too much in a full sized bathtub, but is also small enough to keep it safe for baby. Since it's a blow up tub, all the sides are soft so baby wont bonk her head. There is a drain hole at one end for easy draining, and a suction cup underneath so you can hang it up when not in use. It is also good if you are going on a trip and are not sure if there will be a tub to give baby a bath in.
Mother of three: I have bought alot of baby tubs. This one is the best if you have a fiberglass tub. The seated bathers with suction cups don't stick to my tub. This is great when babies can sit up, you don't have to worry about them sliding around in your big tub. I am expecting a fourth baby and plan on buying this again.
I'm Sorry........................I HATE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I have looked at alot of other reviews before I bought and wished that I hadn't because. You can't go off someone else's experience, you REALLY have to experience it for yourself. First of all it's too bulky. The suction thing on the tub didn't stick and it was in the way when I tried to shower and kept falling down. My poor baby kept sliding because there is no non-skid at the bottom of the tub, so I had to go out and buy a small mat to put at the bottom.I bought this tub only because my baby was out growing the fold away bath chair but it looks as though I will have to continue using it and buy a larger one for her. I was very temped to send it back but I'm just going to sell it on ebay.I'm sorry but it was a waste of money for me. I'm happy that it did aleast work out for the other moms, maybe mines is defected!
Bathtub is made of vinyl -- leaches chemicals!: This bath tub is a great idea, but it's made of vinyl, which makes it unsafe for babies & children. Vinyl leaches chemicals into the air which are very dangerous to humans, esp. babies & children. Ever smell that "new shower curtain" smell (you know the one) its a result of chemical off-gassing, releasing phthalates in your home. Phthalates cause endocrine disruption, are linked to asthma,and have developmental and reproductive effects.If you are buying this thinking it offers a safer bath environment for your child, think again!
Great: After buying a table top bath tub that leaked all over the place I started looking for one that would go in the big bath tub. For a while I used a sling to keep her up right plus I used a foam seat to keep her from sliding all over the place. Once we got done with the sling I kept using the foam seat to keep her in place. Now that she is able to sit up on her own I don't even use the foam seat anymore. She loves it. I plan on buying it for 3 up coming baby showers.
Love It: My daughter is 16 months and we got this since she was growing out of her other bath. She loves it, there is a lot more room in it then I thought, it is cushioned and the real miracle that I never expected to work was the plastic hook to hang the bath on..... it actually stays up. When have you ever had one of those that actually sticks. It is great because it hangs up in the bath and doesn't effect us taking showers.For less then $20 you can't go wrong.
Great....for a short while: We bought this tub 3 months ago for our 6 month old daughter. It was great until it developed a slow leak on a seam. We would just have to re-inflate it a bit before each use, but now it won't even make it through one bath. Since it had only been 3 months, I called Amazon to see if they would replace it. Amazon told me I needed to contact the manufacturer, Kelgard. When I contacted them I was told to contact Amazon. So bottom line is that no one seems to want to talk about replacing it for us. It is great until it leaks. Is sure seems like we should have gotten more than 3 months use from it!
Great bathtub for babies/toddlers: I love this bathtub, and my son does too. The inflatable sides and bottom give a lot of cushioning, and keep my kiddo from banging his head on the tub. He's now almost 2 and still won't take a bath without this tub. He likes to splash around in it, and it uses so much less water than filling the big tub. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that it's not that durable. We're on our third one now - the first got a leak in the seam, the second got a rip in the valve -- but we've been using them since my son was about 8 months old, and the price is good, so all in all I'm still a big fan of this tub.
Fun and practical: I really like this snug-tub for many several reasons. First, it has a suction cap for saftey and you can attached it to either the wall or the floor of your bath tub. Secondly, with its air filled sides, even if your baby accidently bumbs her head, it will not caused any pain. The sides are also very comfortable and pillow-like and she can rests her head there (looking up) while I wash her hair. That actually makes washing hair much easier and prevents soap from entering into her eyes. Thirldly, unlike a bath seat, you do not have to fill your entire bath tub with water and that really saves a lot! The only thing I add onto it is a non-slip rubber mat to its floor. This is much better then having a bath seat because it is much harder to wash your baby's creases with all the bars in between.
Dangerous Tub!: I like the idea behind this tub--the size, the inflatable sides and bottom to cushion baby, the suction cup to attach it to the adult tub and the generous drain are all good features. However, the bottom is so slippery that after one try, I was afraid to use it again! Even though I never take my eyes, nor hands for that matter, off of my son while in the tub, he still slipped all over in this one. You are supposed to be able to lay them back to wash their hair, but he just slipped right down into the bottom of the tub. Unless you find a way to make it slip-proof, even for babies that sit up well, I would not recommend this product!Our Snug Tub seems to have a slow leak which is also annoying.
Leaks air: The drain in the bottom of the tub wasn't made correctly and the tub leaked air the first time we used it.We ended up purchasing a different tub at a baby store, and had much better luck. I'd pass on this tub.
Snug Tub: Snug Tub is great tub. It fits very well in a standard bath tub. Easy to clean out and I love the hang up feature so that it can dry out. The only down side is emptying the water. The water plug is on the bottom and the weight of the tub with the water in it prevents easy drainage of the water. I literally had to lift that end of the tub up so that the water can drain.
best baby gift: I received this tub as a shower gift and used it for my daughter from when she was about 6 months old until she was 3. (when it finally sprung a slow leak) It was the best thing we used for our child and I love to give it as a shower gift.
Not the best: For starters this tub is rather wide on the narrowest end and I was unable to get it under our faucet in the bathtub to fill it with water. This seems a little ridiculous since I'd rather not fill it using a cup. Our bathtubs is a regular size (at least I thought). My child also seemed to slide a lot when I would lean her back to wash her hair, she would slide down into the tub.We decided to send this one back. The biggest drawback was the fact that I could not fill this tub easily.
Perfect concept, just plan on buying a vinyl sealer: In using this product for approx. a year, I have to had to use vinyl sealer for a couple of leaks around the seams. The concept is incredible and has saved my daughter's head a couple of times. The non-slip bottom is excellent! She loves playing in it as well. If it were made with better vinyl I would give it a 10 star! Seriously, if you don't want to make repairs, pass on this product otherwise it is money down the drain in approx. 1 month.
Great tub!!!: We love this tub. It lets my daughter play in the tub without me having to hang on to her. Before we got this, she was likely to slip and seemed to feel unsecure in the big tub. Now she plays and seems comfortable. I like that it saves water also. It took some air to blow up but we leave it blown up and hang it on the wall of the tub when we are not using it. Definitely worth the money, it solved all our problems.
Very slippery and dangerous: I was hoping this would be a good transition tub for my 6 month old who is growing out of the tub that fits in the sink.If you are in the same situation, I caution you with this purchase -1) It reeks like plastic and has for weeks.2) it is dangerously slippery. My son can sit up very securely, however he immediately slid. I even bought a tub mat insert to try, and he still slipped.3) It barely fits into our tub.
I wish I saw this when I registered!: What a great tub! I was getting so frustrated with those plastic tubs...they were so hard and uncomfortable for my baby. A friend told me about this tub, and as soon as my daughter could sit up on her own, I bought it! She has so much fun in it, and I'm not as stressed out during bath time! The fact that it is inflatable is so nice, because one time she teetered over a little and did not get hurt because of the nice, soft sides! It is also so easy to clean and store as well (it has a suction cup on it so it attaches very nicely to the back wall of the shower). I also like that the bottom isn't too slippery.
Great bathtub!: Bought this for my baby granddaughter's recent visit. My daughter is so happy with it that she wants to take it home with her! Nice size. Soft for baby.Has a large suction cup to hang it from the shower wall when not in use and has a drain hole at opposite end so drains and dries nicely
great buy: This is a great tub for the price. My 9-month old daughter uses it easily and it is much bigger than the munchkin ducky tub that we had previously. I do not think that it is slippery like some of the others have noted. For a baby who can easily sit on her own, the surface is just right.
Much better than his boxing book...: His new book does have some new things to teach you. The grappling and the Greco-Roman to freestyle moves are very effective. However, I do believe to be a better ground fighter, it's better to learn judo and jijitsu since that gives you quicker and more effective moves utilizing all your body and chi.
Good book to fantasize about!: I was a 3 time city champ wrestler in H.S. I know plenty about the sport. However, I don't recommend this book as a manual to learn how to wrestle in the street. The moves are far too advanced for someone to actually pull them off in a real fight. Especially against someone really determined to kick your ass and who won't follow the "rules". The author repeats himself over and over, going back to topics in previous chapters etc. He just keeps praising himself as if he were a great fighter. "Ohh, in my days as a streetfighter this and that" Overall the book is somewhat disorganized and looks like if a 5th grader wrote it as a book report about wresling. I gave the book 2 stars because he gives pretty good advice about weight training. You will make better use of your hard earned cash taking a Ju-jiutsu book or course.
PROUD CITADEL: THE BOOK IS IN BETTER CONDITION THAN EXPECTED..THE ONLY THING REALLY BAD ABOUT THESE BOOKS IS THE SMELL. WHEN STORING OLDER BOOKS THAT AREN'T READ VERY OFTEN INSERT A CLEAN DRYER SHEET IN BETWEEN THE PAGES..IT CUTS DOWN OR ELIMINATES THE OLD SMELL ENTIRELY..SINCE RECEIVING THESE BOOKS I MYSELF HAVE DONE THIS..THANK YOU AMAZON FOR ALLOWING ME TO HAVE THESE BOOKS AGAINAND I WILL BE PLACING ANOTHER ORDER FOR MORE...LORA

great product: product was as advertised, no problems with installation,operates as it should, enough info provided to make sure everyyhing is setup correctly.
The Most Astute Celebrity Biographical Dictionary Around: If you love good, pointed writing, writing that really goes to the heart of what we see on the big screen when we see certain film actors, this is your book. Really well-written, certainly opinionated (but justifiably, in all cases), thoughtful, insightful, amusing, witty. As you read each entry, you'll be saying to yourself, "That's EXACTLY how I feel about SoAndSo!," because the author expresses each film person's essence so aptly. The author has apparently known and/or met many of the entries, so is able to add personal experience with these people to his vast historical knowledge of their work. A wonderful work.
Bios by a Badmouth: I was looking forward to something more opinionated than the useful and comprehensive but rather dry film bios of Katz's Film Encylopedia. Well, I got opinion in this Biographical Dictionary.Unfortunately, that opinion is from someone who apparently thinks one must be a curmudgeon in order to be a critic. It is obvious from this massive and hard-laboured work, that David Thomson is a pedant and a misanthrope. He really doesn't like much of anyone, especially those whose output is entertainment.Woe be unto the actor or director deemed here as (a) politically incorrect or (b) an audience pleaser. As George Lucas has said, Thomson doesn't know much about the movie business. But he does know about Ceenma Art.If you are the type who thinks himself a cinema Enthusiast, who lives at the Penultimate Picture Palace, swooning at spittle on the faces of Dreyers's close-ups, you will no doubt relish Thomson's tome.
And they cut down forests for this?: Why does this thing get all the great scores? Doesn't anyone else see that Thomson's "Dictionary" is mean spirited and condescending? Ok, maybe a couple of others. I guess you could use this snob's eye view of the movie industry for a laugh at the brilliant putdowns with no substance to go with them. For example, Thomson dismisses George Brent because he considers him overweight but spends a lot of time fawning over Johnny Carson. (Johnny Carson?) Like his book about Nevada, Thomson's book about movie people seems to be an exercise in showing everyone how culturally superior David Thomson is. So, Nevada is a "blank," and American filmmakers barely adequate, unless they're the artsy type? Well, behind the words, David Thomson is also a blank, barely worth notice. But he can still get published by the likes of Knopf. Shows how low Knopf has sunk.
Very sweet: Nice graphic, very soft. My 2 year old loves it. Not a blanket for warmth but she is more into carrying it around like Linus. It's perfect for her purposes.
Often Annoying: "Predictable" might be a good word to summarize this book. "Repetitious" would be another. I thought, if Miss Abby tells one more person how much she wants to talk to somebody, I'll put the book down. Instead I found myself highlighting the instances, at least for a little while. There were many.In related news, we learn (for the 50th time) that Eli doesn't talk at all, Obediah talks a lot, Laura Mabrey is helpful AND talkative, and Rosa Moon didn't talk before they hugged and became friends, but now she does. Thaddeus offers, within 3 sentences of their introduction, to talk to dear Miss Abby. Hooray!Characterization is shallow. Plot - well, will she or won't she be able to talk to dear dependable Thad and find happiness? Let's guess.It's grammatical, but beyond that hard to enjoy.
Incomplete romance: I agree with the other reviewers that the story got repetitious and tedious. I enjoyed Abby's time with Thad. But the story ended so suddenly. It was really disappointing and anticlimactic. And there was no love scene other than holding hands and kissing.
Powerful, Poignant Book: One of the most powerful books I've read in years.No kidding.As a professor, this book impressed me by its historical clarity.And as a humanist, the book touched me for its poignant stories. The people that Susan Shapiro interviews are both ordinary and extraordinary. If you have a belief in the strength of the human spirit, this book will resonate with you. And if you don't, this book can help.
Everyday Life in Post-Communist Eastern Europe: A great read! I highly recommend this book to any person with an interest in Eastern Europe. The writers truly capture the feel of what day-to-day life is really like for people in this fasctinating region of the world.
Description is dead wrong: The description is wrong, this is for the bolts only and they are not skinpacked, they are loose in a plastic container, and the picture shows nuts also.... No nuts... I contacted the seller and said that the description was amazon's fault and that they were going to remove the product... Guess not. The seller did send me the lug nuts to go with the bolts, so the situation is rectified. But it took me two weeks to get something I could have purchased at atuozone in one afternooon for a couple dollars more.
Do Not buy this from Amazon - no customer service: I found the best price on Amazon but that was where the service ended. There was a broken plastic part that controls the auto propel. I requested Amazon order the part for me. They have no idea how to do it or do any kind of customer service. Then I requested some credit and I would go get the part and then they did not even bother with a reply. So by the time I get the part ordered and pay for shipping there is NO advantage from buying this from Amazon.
Shipped Damaged: I'm very disappointed that this highly rated lawn mower arrived damaged. Lawn-Boy immediately gave me a local repair facility that estimated a 3 week backlog of other work. The UPS driver was careful delivering it, so I suspect it was dropped prior to his receipt. The right rear wheel cannot be adjusted beyond setting #2. Bent axel?
sorry lawn boy: Arrived with broken part on handle (sens-s-speed). Didn't understand that this model had separate gas and oil which necessitates oil change (my fault). Very unhappy with product. Previous owner of 4 Lawn Boys with which we were very pleased!
Great Mower: So far so good. I have only used it 3 times but the experice has been great. The shipment came quickly and undamaged, all parts were there. Extremely easy set up (just roll it out of the box, add oil, hook up bag, charge battery and turn key). It has started very time and seems to be of good overall quaility. I will need to see how it performs over the summer and whether it starts next spring. I would recommend this product.
Great mower for the price, but self-propell stopped working after 2 mows: I purchased this product for a great price and am quite happy with the quality, however, when I received the mower, there were parts sticking out of the box and the wheels were pushed down beyond the last height adjustment notch. A close inspection and a few mows didn't show up anything. Unfortunately 3 times a charm, as the clips inside the self-propelling wheels broke off, so I need to send this in to a Lawn-Boy repair shop to get fixed, if they won't give me the clips to fix it myself. Otherwise I'm quite satisfied with the purchase and would recommend the product to anyone.
Smooth running machine: After suffering a back injury earlier in the year, I had to find a lawn mower that would not be too difficult to use. I decided on the Lawn Boy 10686. I have not been disappointed. Amazon's shipping was very quick. I received the mower five days after buying it. It took a time or two using it to learn how it handles. The variable speed drive makes it go with almost no effort. Hills are a little more effort. The only problem I have found so far with this mower is when using it around bushes the wire to the electric start may snag and get pulled loose. Strapping the wire to the handle may solve this little problem. A fine lawn mower considering I can cut my whole yard non-stop with a bad back.
Mine arrived damaged too!: Apparently, there's a high risk of getting these nice lawn mowers delivered damaged. Like the reviewer below both rear wheels are toed inward from being dropped. The left rear is so bad that it cannot be adjusted beyond the 2" mark without the tire hitting the decking. Upon closer inspection of the steel deck at the weld joint it's shows that it's actually cracked! I can see the imprint where the arm hit the deck from being dropped and bent the decking. No telling what the axle looks like. It's really is a shame because the mower itself is of great quality.Amazon has got to do a better job of shipping these mowers or stop selling them. I rate the mower a five, delivery a big fat zero.
Tarantino Had a Hand in It: Killing Zoe is an interesting movie with some great lines in it. For example an American tourist goes to the bank robbers and says you would be speaking German if it weren't for us! right before he gets shot in the face. But the movie is predictable but is an overall enjoyable movie to watch.
Right up there with "Dune": My most recent ex-wife refused to watch this because her daughter's name matched 50% of the title (no...not Killing). When I finally did get to see the thing, I was...let down. It had, after all, been highly recommended by friends. Gosh: drugs, violence, a bit of skin, and ... Dixieland? Except for the Dixieland, I've seen it-seen it-seen it. And so have you.Personally, the only memorable moments involved an expired kitty cat and a brief exchange over the wisdom of doing a line of heroin in a crowded night-spot (Q:What about all these people? A:"Let zem geet zair own").There are better ways to pass the time.
Disapointing.: Despite all the talent surrounding "Killing Zoe" I found it to be routine and disapointing. How could the man who helped write the zany, unpredictable rollercoaster "Pulp Fiction" write and direct such a standard, dull movie? This movie rarely held my attention and I felt it was pretentious and contrived. Also, it lacked the surprise and insanity of "Reservoir Dogs," which it frequently seemed to be ripping off and copying off of.
Stinks: Very disappointing. I'm a big fan of Tarantino/Rodriquez-type films, but this one is flat out stupid. No sympathetic characters, action is blurry. Rent it if you must.
Don't listen to Leonard Maltin: This movie is better than Pulp Fiction. That is a bold statement but Avary is undoubtably one of the best writer\directors around. This movie draws you in completely and makes you want to rob banks. I can personally say that it led to my arrest for attempted auto theft. That being said, don't be scared. Rent or buy this movie immediately and you'll see what I mean.
Lame: come on! never have i seen a more contrived, indulgent Tarantino rip off in my life. An unoriginal bore with hammy acting, unispired directing and an idiotic story.
WASTE OF TIME: I am no fan of Julie Delpy, but she was the best thing about this movie. The film was plotless and a BIG waste of time. Half of the movie is wasted with a bunch of French characters getting drugged up... and all this wasted time really irritated me and actually angered me. I could not believe I was sitting there watching such stupidity. (I had to sit through it because a friend agreed to watch a movie I recommended if I would do the same). Eric Stoltz could do better than this, but for some reason, here he is in this film about a prostitute (Delpy) who saves the day (at least for Stoltz) after a bank robbery gone bad. If I could give this film ZERO stars, I would. Don't waste a moment of your precious time on this garbage.
Absolutely brilliant!: I don`t have the words to describe this movie.I am only 14 years,old.Now is 1999. I have seen the movie a few days ago,and I am still under its spell. I think it was the best thing ever made.EVER. I live in Bosnia,Sarajevo. Unfortunately,I can`t even buy this movie,and I am going to regret it for LIFE.
.: A relatively bad movie which is helped primarily by an interesting premise and (here and there) some real style. The first half of this movie is drawn-out, poorly acted, and generally incredibly dull. The second half, once the heist begins, is circumstantially well set up and sometimes entertaining, at one or two points even a touch brilliant, but it isn't enough to counterbalance the questionable performances (save for the really mean French guy, he's great), the over-the-top gimmicks, the badly developed drama, and general chaotic, self-indulgent unevenness that plague the movie as a whole.
Killing Zoe Great, yet One Question: I thouroughly enjoyed this film mainly because it is itensly raw or even 'pulp'. Hmmm I wonder why. For taking place in France (though it was filmed in Cali.) on Bastille Day and the never-boring heist genre I definately recommend it. I have ONE question though. Whats on the cover in his hand. In the movie he walks towards the screen and flicks something and it makes a small explosion. Is it a cigarette or is it a heroine-related hallucinations. It's as if Avary, Stoltz, Bender, and Tarantino are throwing a riddle in our faces. It reminds me of whats in the suitcase in Pulp Fiction. All-in-all, a great film.
Strange but compelling: This has been a long-time favorite movie of mine... it's visual style and frantic pace provide a good movie experience without ever going over the top and becoming completely unbelievable. While never becoming completely detached from reality, the movie does provide some euphoric moments... dream-like sex scenes, and drug-induced trance sequences set the mood for the bank robbery that the story revolves around. Comparisons to Tarntino could also be made, as Killing Zoe shares much of his gritty realistic view of criminals and the environment they live in. Highly recommended; for the price this is a must-own DVD.
"Killing Zoe" is just average.: "Killing Zoe" is a slow moving bank hiest gone awry film that is no where near as involving or breathtaking as Quenton Tarintino's "Reservoir Dogs," which brilliantly tackles similar material. "Killing Zoe" simpley lacks Tarintino's energetic story telling abilities. It also lacks intresting characters we can relate to, complexity, and plot twists. It contains virtually no character developement and no big twists or turns in the plot. Not to mention the huge holes in logic.
Leonard Maltin hit the nail on the head.: I agree with Maltin's review completely, it was disapointing and completly average. Considering films such as "Albino Alligator," "Reservoir Dogs," and "In Harm's Way," "Killing Zoe" is nothing special or worth checking out.
Fast paced action film that is amazingly twisted: This early Tarentino Flic has all the elements of a great Tarentino action Movie. We start the movie with Eric Stolts, the American in France, has come to pull of a hiest with his French friend. There's lots of killing, guns, romance and intreague. If you like Tarentino movies, or just love an amazing action movie, this is a must buy.
SLOW AND DULL: Film is a pulp fiction type. Very dull and slow in plot development. Bank robbery scene is compelling but also a tired retread. Bottom line is boredom. Not worth the time to watch. save yourself and skip this one. . .
Killing The Audience: A very weak and uninspiring bank heist film that is completely predictable from the first 5 minutes into the movie. Overdone plot about a robbery gone wrong and the safe-cracker hero who has a heart. Nothing original here except for scenes too vulgar and tasteless to show on any film except for x-rated gay films.The script is nihl and the acting less than stellar. The screenplay is littered with intentional conincidences too absurd to be credible. I frankly could have done without the grotesque heroin-induced sodomy scenes. Watch "Heat" instead if you want to see a great bank heist film. Don't waste your time or money on this one, it's a sleeper at best: A 0 rating is called for.
violent = fun: People are complaining about this movie because it wasn't"thought provoking". Like so many other people, I enjoy watching films that stimulate my mind, and actually give me some type of knowledge by the end. But everyonce in awhile, I like to watch nothing but pure, simple violence and sex...this movie provided just that. If you haven't seen it yet, and you've read the reviews, you already know the basic plot. See it anyway if you like alot of senseless violence, blood, drug use, demented humor and Julie Delphy nake. This movie is junk food for your head, and everyone likes junk food everyonce in awhile...unless you're a complete tighta$$. Good ACTION movie, it also has a unique soundtrack
Good direction, bad plot.: Flashy camera work does not make a good movie. This was never more evident than in Avary's "Killing Zoe." The director is obviously a talented director. As a writer, however, he ignores key elements such as character developement, plot twists, and the most important element in any hiest film: the element of surprise. Despite one scene involving an explosion, "Killing Zoe" is frequently predictable and plain dull. If you want to see a good caper movie check out Tarantino's "Resevoir Dogs" or Kubrick's "The Killing."
Its 2.4Ghz from the phone to the base!!!: I just cancelled my order for this phone. I was warned by a reviewer of a similar vtech product that they do this trick of using 2.4ghz for the handset. I verified this by looking at the tech manual on their web site vtech.com. Its on one of the last pages in small typing. This will SCREW your wireless internet. What a disgrace. Amazon should filter out these guys. From now on only Panasonic.
Great While It's Working: I've heard great things about vtech phones. I'm not sure if I just have bad luck and keep hitting a bad batch. However I've had two of these models. I'm on my third replacement. The first 6821 I had the power on button stopped responding after one week, soon I was toggling the speakerphone button as a means to answer the phone. That stopped responding a few days after the on button. Soon after that the off button stopped working. Vtech replaced the phone under warranty. Great service. Second phone, about 3 months in the on button once again stopped responding, fearing the same it was returned again. hopefully 3 is the charm, but i'd prefer it to be okay on the first try. otherwise the features/price are great for this phone
best phone for the money by a mile: small, stylish, great sound, great speakerphone, great range, expandable, easy to use, all the features you need without the ones you don't.
Do not buy this phone.: Its keypad surface started rubbing off within two weeks of the purchase. Circuit City replaced it immediately but he new phone soon had the same quality problem with the keys and then 6 months later the ringer died. Calling Vtech customer service was useless. The phone was under warranty but hey require that you send them the old phone back first before they send out a replacement. That leaves you without a phone for a minimum of two weeks plus you have to pay for shipping!
Poorly made: I don't know if the Thomas friends have gotten kind of cheap since the new company took over, but Fergus is not a well made toy. The first Fergus we had, the wheel broke off. The company was really good about replacing him, but the replacement came and within a week he too was broken, not only the wheel, but part of the wood had chipped off. The idea is kind of cool, the wheel turns the gear , turning another wheel. That is all plastic, including the axle for the middle gear. Maybe had that axle been metal, it would be more durable. I can't recommend this as a toy, only for the collector.
durable and high quality: well made, durable toy is a personal favorite of my 2 year old train-obsessed son. All the engines in the wooden track line are quality products and I highly recommend them.
Okay if there isn't something better around: Having read numerous other books on a similar subject, I have to say that I was disappointed in this one. While the writing style is nice, and the idea of having one's children taken away is indeed emotional, I found that in this book all conflicts wrapped up nicely, neatly, and FAR too easily and quickly at the end. So quickly and easily, in fact, that there may as well have been no conflict at all, and what's worse, the author starts setting up the easy resolution pretty early on. I kept reading thinking there would be a twist at the end, but nope--if you read this book and after about the first third, you start to think--it can't really be that easy, can it?--well, yes, it can.If you're looking for a light read with unneccesary romantic side stories for the lesser characters, this is a great choice. Not a horrible book, but not a book that makes me want to read her other two.
A Story With No Villains: Dina is the American wife of Karim, an Arab from Jordan. The couple live in New York in post 911 days. A working mother of young twins and an older boy who has just confessed to being gay, Diana is devestated when Karim takes the twins, without her knowledge until they are gone, to his family home in Jordan. His feeling is that America has corrupted his older son and he cannot allow that to happen to the twins, especially the boy. The book is an easy read and kept my attention. I titled this review "A Story With No Villains" unless one would classify the clash of cultures as such. Prepared to hate Karim, I came to understand how culture shaped his thinking,as culture shapes all our thinking. Eunice Boeve, author of Maggie Rose and Sass
tail light assembly: The product arrived quicker than I expected and neatly packaged. It fit perfectly but I found it $10 cheaper in Ebay :-(
A flawed attempt to make history more readable.: I was disappointed with this book. The admittedly clever techniques of trying to explain early Christianity through the notes of time travelers, a television script, make believe letters between early Christians, and critiques of these techniques from "colleagues" simply didn't work for me.Don't get me wrong, there is obviously solid scholarship behind this unique presentation. The information presented is very interesting but the method of story telling gets in the way. The author is a academic and not a novelist. The contrived nature of the novel-like elements detracted from the history being presented.The book did add to my historical understanding of the development of Christianity, but I would not wish to read another work of scholarship written in a similarly "innovative" style
Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.: This book is fantastic. Using historical information the author recreates the ancient world. Five pages into the visit to Pompeii, I was completely hooked. This is a book that everyone should read.
The Golden Zither: I was very disappointed with this product. I have some nice Zither recordings, and this one went straight into the trash can.Sorry, mabe someone else will like it, I didn't!
just like other books: Pretty much repeats himself. If you have his other books don't worry about getting this one and wasting your time. Author is very arrogant and has a big ego and that is a turn off.
one hell of an album: This album starts off with a great intro track, which is amazing. Then that trend continues until the end of the album, every track shows work in it and Pete Miser can actually rhyme unlike your more famous artists (Eminem, 50 cent, the game to name a few) He really talks about things that you can relate to (I doubt that any of the famous rappers go to the `hood in an Escalade because we all know they would be robbed!) such as ex-girlfriends, and he talks about the rap industry in my favorite song "table scraps". This album is purely great and is a must if you prefer DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince to Eminem, or the Wu-Tang Clan to Snoop Dogg.
Best rap album you haven't heard: If you've ever checked out Pete before, this album's only surprise is that he continues to be surprising. Some of the smartest lyrics you're likely to come across, and super tight production makes every listen a pleasure, you hear something new every time. It doesn't really sound like his last album, Radio Free Brooklyn, but it's not such a big disconnect that it sounds like a different person. Just awesome, though. And if you ever have a chance to check out the live band, don't miss it, they're no joke!
Good thinking movie, but it is NOT in color: Being a fan of Patrick McGoohan, I was aware of this film long ago, and have only been able to enjoy it through old taped copies. When I saw it appear on DVD, I was delighted. However, the "if it's too good to be true..." theory validated my skeptism when I saw that this particular version was formatted in color - as Amazon's description indicated. There are two exact DVD's of this movie available through Amazon. I couldn't differentiate between the two according to the product descriptions, so of course I went for the one that was supposed to the color version. I guess it was referring to the on-screen menus, but I hope not because that would be purposely deceptive. I'm hoping Amazon's format description was simply an error.
Great to fall asleep to: I bought this to play when I need to relax and start to fall asleep. It does a good job - I know music is very personal and subjective - so my 4 stars could be some else's 1 star. So listen to the samples before you buy this!
The Animals learn about the importance of being kind: This book has a wonderful message about being kind to others no matter how small or insignificant we might think they are. The animals do what is necessary to secure food. Their country is in a famine, and one tortoise helps provide for the key necessary to eat from the only tree providing food. They forget who helped them get the food, and selfishly try to eat only to come to their own ruin in the process. The pictures are unique in their African geometrical designs, and add to the overall folklore of the story.
A good primer for historiographical debates: I found this book very helpful in understanding the methodologies behind the different "houses" of historiography. As the first reviewer stated, it can sometimes be tedious, but if you need to know this stuff, this is a relatively painless way to go about doing it. Finally, I would just like to pose a question: why would anyone trust a review by a college student who cannot correctly spell "nonsense"?
Houses of History: A good, easy to follow guide to schools of history. Though some of the schools may be more method than actual approach, the work gives easy to follow explanations of the schools, their adherents, arguments and problems followed by an example of what the editor considers typical of the school.
This book will make you hate history: jargon free! HA! That's a good one. I had to read this for a second year historiography course. This is an extremely poorly written text which is very difficult to understand. The authors went out of their way to cloud the arguments in confusing language. I went into the course loving history. Now at the end of my second year I am switching majors because I would have to take a similar course in fourth year. History itself I love. Historiography is BORING. Such stupid debates permeate this discipline. gender history, oral history,... Forget this nonsence.
I recieved a different book cover: The story line fits the sequel with suspense, action, a plausible plot but tends to be "exposition-heavy" when Colonel Dmitri Priabin (KGB) catches up with Gant and Anna, by boarding the train at Chudovo just before Leningrad and ends with Anna being shot attempting to cross into Finland.Almost as good as "Firefox" and a much better read than my novel "The Revelation, Year 2027, it's Coming!"
Books were fine. Better be prepared to wait!: Books were fine and in decent shape for their age. To say service was bad, however, would imply that there was any at all. Ordered my books in early August. Heard nothing for a month! Then got email notifying me of tracking numbers and items shipped. Checked the #s, for tracking to only find out that they did not exist. Emailed the company stating the problem and copies of the order and tracking #s. Got nothing for nearly three months. Then someone asked me how my order went in November. Again, I described by problem. and after three more weeks and a short "I'll check into it" reply. I finally got my books after 3 1/2 months. If you are REALLY looking for a certain book it might be worth it otherwise I'd pass if I were you.
False description.: False description, only 1 holder received instead of 2 holders stated in the description. Quality is all right, but for almost $20 dollars, it is too expensive for just 1 holder.
A must-read!: Cheryl Walker's book on Elizabeth Bishop and God is spectacular. It explores a poet's spiritual journey that is filled with challenging questions spanning a lifetime. I think that this text is essential reading for anyone interested in Bishop, poetry and spirituality, and women's spirituality.
Great birks for a great price: I've been looking to purchase these for a while, and found them to be $125 at most places. If you love birkenstock clogs, you'll love these. True to size. More narrow than birkenstock boston clogs.
Great quality, unbeatable price for this shoe!: This is a "narrow" in Birkenstock speak, but I've got a wide foot and it still works for me. What a bargain! This is a full coverage clog in great quality suede, and usually around $130 in stores.Generally, Birks are the most comfortable shoe I can wear - with wide flat feet, most North American sizes are too narrow. With the contoured footbed, I get an arch support and heel cup which actually supports my foot without trying to contort it to someone else's foot shape.I am very, very psyched to have found this on Amazon. Please bring more!
Eaton Clog: The Eaton Clog is just as I'd hoped. I have fibromyalgia and depend on the Birkenstock shoes to keep me from having leg and hip pain. The Eaton is nice looking & was totally comfortable even the first day I wore them (shopping!). I like ordering over the net & the order arrived very quickly.
Wonderful: I've worn these at work for over a year (intermittently!) and absolutely love them. The strap/ buckle dresses them up enough to be worn with nicer trouser pants. Incredibly comfortable after an initial break-in period of a few weeks. My other shoes have been neglected, unfortunately. My only complaint is...yes, they do start to smell after a few months, probably because of the porous suede footbed and upper. Best remedy I've heard is to put them in the freezer overnight when needed.
birkenstock eaton clog - love it: I have wanted these shoes for a long time, but waited until I could get them for an amazing price at amazon. Comfortable as all birks are and much more tailored looking than the basic Boston clog. Love it!
Superficial coverage: Initially, the title of the book makes it seem exciting. However, all topics are covered very briefly and the book assumes the reader has a large repository of knowledge (so much so that, in fact, those who possess that knowledge would not actually need this book!). Coverage of alterntative market forms is weak. Unfortunately, this book is continued testimony to the fact that Brits still live in their experience, oblivious to the incredibly cutting edge work being done in this sector in other parts of the world.
Good while it worked...but it didn't work long.: I purchased this to use while running. The battery that came with it didn't work...I purchased a battery and it worked for 4 runs. Nice idea, but unreliable.
Korg MM-1: I bought a Korg MM-1 Micro Metronome...the idea is great, a small in the ear metrognome. The problem is that this unit is pretty much worthless. Obviously the setting controls are small and hard to see and use, especially for those of us needing reading glasses. Main problem is the unit is unreliable and worked only sporadically. Several times I would have to remove the battery and then re-install to get the unit to work...finally I've figured the best thing to do is simply throw this unit away and find something that actually works. jg
Korg MM1 impractical design: I bought the Korg MM1 to help with drum rudiments - those repetitious things you must do. However, I soon found that when adjusting it in the ear, it is nearly impossible to NOT touch one of the three controls which will change the tempo up or down or change the mode.I'm considering sawing a penny in half and using silicon sealer to glue it right over the KORG on the body - like the back fin of a fish. Then and only then will I have something to hold onto that doesn't have a control button.Once the back fin is in place I'd give it 4 stars due to its handy size and capabilities. Out of the box, its only 2 stars.
It's not what I spected: I'm a drumer, and I wanted to buy de MM-1 to use it while rehersing with the band. The problem is that when I start playing I can't follow the beat of the MM-1 because I can't hear it over the drum set, the guitars, the base and the vocals!!! So there's no use to try it while playing with a band. I could recomend it to Bass or Guitar players to practice at home, but nothing else.
What a CD.: This band has an accoustic ability that is amazing. I love the way that they blend a variety of music with seamless precision. I love the way the accordian is used and does not stick out but is smoothly woven in. I too have seen these guys and girl in concert and I have never wanted to laugh and cry at the same time before in all my life. The words of the songs melt a broken heart and make it refreshed. What else can I say but that they are amazingly beautiful.
Good Things from FOCP!: Let's just put it this way... if my house was burning down and I could only grab one CD to listen to as I drive away from the smoldering wreckage, it would be this one. These guys are so incredibly talented and IT'S ABOUT TIME they got the publicity and recognition due them! They never, ever disappoint with their thoughtful lyrics and beautiful music. It's downright soul-grabbing stuff... If you ever get a chance, check them out in person (hopefully they'll get to go farther from the Northwest soon), but if you can't, this CD is the next best thing. Be careful, though... you might find yourself torn away from whatever you were trying to get done, mesmerized by the incredible stuff coming from the CD player=) Five O' Clock People deserve 10 stars and four thumbs up.
depth, commitment, and musical genius: i've been a big fan of these guys for the last three or so years, and im contiually amazed. i have all of five o'clock people's albums (including the very very first one)and each one has something new to offer. beginning to end, the nothing venture is full of lush sounds, excellent production, tight harmonies and strong lyrics. they have an amazing way of portraying exactly what they want people to hear. their music and lyrics match very well. i see these guys (and girl)taking music like jars of clay, burlap to cashmere and the dave matthews band a little further. all of their personalities come through in their music making a huge impact on their listeners. this is a must-have album. a true masterpiece.
Bulb is NON replaceable: My toddler fell in love w/ this lamp. Every night he goes to sleep watching the fish swim round and round. I wanted to buy replacement bulbs before the original bulb would go out. My husband took a look at it and said it seemed to be glued in, but couldn't find a wattage number on it or any info. So I emailed the manufacturer and this was his reply:I apologize. Those fish lamp do not have replacement light bulbs.Once those light bulb are out and It will be best to buy another one.Because, changing light bulb would need some tech issue and we do notrecommend it.Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. Had I known this, I would have never purchased the lamp. I dread the night it goes out and I have to contend w/ my son's tears. Now I'm in the process of looking for a similar lamp w/ REPLACEMENT bulbs.
Fun: A characteristically enjoyable Ramona book. Obviously Beverly Cleary has never forgotten what it's like to be a kid. She's very good at showing that children have feelings and thoughts of their own and how children can be both petty and noble. Also, Cleary never talks down to her young readers, using such words as "reflect" and "apparent," which not all grade-schoolers might be familiar with. I think her books are very aspirational, showing children that they can be more than they are. Ramona, to me, is the embodiment of aspiration, with her creativity, imagination, and talent for self-actualization. I liked this book because it introduced the character of Yard Ape, who is described as "sturdy" and "smart and lively," the perfect foil to Ramona herself.
Don't get the audio book!: This review only applies to the audio version of the book. Stockard Channing obviously wasn't getting paid by the hour - I've never heard an audio book be read so fast! I don't know if anyone could follow a book being read like this.
Extremely fast shipping, great customer service!: What a great company to work with....I needed a couple books quickly for my daughter's birthday. They came through, and everything turned out perfect! What a great experience! Extremely fast shipping, and great customer service. Thank you so much!!!!!
Classic!: Being eight isn't easy; just ask Ramona Quimby. She's expected to be old enough to "play nicely" with her baby-sitter's toddler and to understand why the family hasn't enough money for life's little extras...but somehow, she isn't old enough to be included in her older sister Beezus' plans or to understand why her teacher might not like her.Although written decades ago, Ramona's life is plain to anyone who reads about her today. What child can't relate to her joys and worries? Best of all, no matter what happens, it's apparent that Ramona will be all right...she has a family that love one another and will stick together through good and bad times alike.
Cute and funny: I first had to read this book in third grade (now i'm in seventh) and I thought the cover made it look dumb, but it ended up being a really good book.
Missing and Reprinted: This book was a sad excuse. The cover was in great condition. There were chapters missing and reprinted in the wrong place in this book. It was upsetting not being able to know how the book ended.
Awesome book!: Awesome book Beverly clearly!! I really want another one I will get it tomorrow. Bot you did a great job I rate it at 5 stars!!!!!
great read for third graders and young at heart: This is one of my all-time favorite books. I still have the old orange covered, hardback book in my closet. A few years ago, I even purchased and occasionally listen to the audiobook, although Stockard Channing's voice can sometimes be annoying.In this book, Ramona is starting a new school, while her mother starts working and her father goes to school. From Ramona's interactions with her new classmates and after school "family," to her adjusting to the changes in her real family's circumstances, the situations that Beverly Cleary creates for Ramona in this book are situations to which the average person can relate. That is what makes this and the other Ramona books worth the read.
Childhood favorite of mine: I purchased this as a gift for my seven year-old niece. She enjoyed it and is a fan of the series.
gift: A perfect book for a second grader. Every child needs to read and Beverly Cleary is a perfect author for young girls.
Ramona lacks excitement: I used this book as a read aloud in my 3rd grade classroom, and to put it bluntly, my students found it to be boring. A lot of the language seemed "dated." During Cleary's attempts at humor, I found my students staring at me with "I don't get it" looks on their faces. I have found the whole Ramona series to be a little disappointing. A better choice for 3rd graders is the Fudge series by Judy Blume.To put it bluntly, my 3rd graders found this book to be boring. I used this book as a read aloud in my classroom.
Finally Available!: I have been searching for the 1st and 2nd annual collections of Dozois' Year's Best Science Fiction for many, many years. I have searched vast used-book emporiums and have canvassed the internet in vain. The only copies I could find were going for several hundred dollars (not going to happen). These were the only 2 that I did not have on my shelves. I can't believe they are finally available and in Kindle edition no less. I have the hard-back editions of the rest of the series, but since I am trying to streamline my physical library I am hoping the publisher makes all of the books available for Kindle.Great bang for the buck. I highly recommend ALL the books in this series.
a little bit inferior quality: Length:: 0:20 MinsMy first impression of the shoes is "those shoes are a little bit roughly made".Right side is OK, but left side looks rough. I think the products contains some bad things.I think that the condition of each product should be all about luck, but I wanted to share the information with you.
Excellent product.: Fue una muy buena compra, excelente calidad, tallas ideales, lindos diseos actuales. Recomiendo a todoas a comprar este producto, se llevarn una buena sorpresa y le encantar si es un regalo para alguien.
Wasn't the quality I expected.: It was delivered at time. And seemed to be a good deal at the first glance; however, it wasn't.When I started wearing that Ferrari shoe, which is the reason why I bought it, the edge of the rubber bottom started to loose its ability to be stuck to upper leather and exibit a bad apearance. Maybe because the product was stored in stock for a long time or maybe for other reasons. Any way, the prodoct wasn't the same value or quality of pumma's shoes that I have bought in the past.
Great shoe: This shoe is awesome. Well built and very comfortable. The lacing system is a bit flaky as you do not want to tighten your shoe to much fear of ripping the inside eyelets. Delivery was super fast and hassle free. Make sure you put on a leather protector.
Excellent texture, but too expensive: If you need dry wipes for cleaning a baby, then these are the best quality I've found. The Medline are good bang for the buck dry, but when you wet them they are too rough; probably too tightly woven even though smooth on the surface when dry. Would give PeeWees 5 stars if it weren't for the price. Also wish these dry wipes came with dispensers. Doesn't anyone make dry baby wipes that come in dispensers just like wet wipes? It would seem like an obvious product to make, but I haven't come across any yet.
Love it, but it's Pricey!: We love using these to bathe our two month old son but they're really expensive!!! We found something similar at Babies R Us (store brand) and they were about $3 per box. They're not as soft as these, but they're still soft and work great. Unfortunately we will not be buying again unless the price comes down. Awesome product, though.
Not impressed: Compared to other dry wash cloths, these were both small, expensive and not as good. When you can get 500 pcs for just above 20 usd why buy these?
Kinda skimpy on number of entry of words: Kinda skimpy on number of entries for 2nd grader. I would recommend when buying a Thesaurus for your kid to check for the number of word entries to see if its appropriate for your child's age group. Next time I would purchase one with more entries. Otherwise its a good resource for 1st grade or below.
a must!: Its a must book for any pre-k/k/1/2 graders (your mileage can vary).However, it is up to you, parents, to have your kids to use this book. If your precious asks you for a word definition - don't just tell them, send them to look it up in the book, you know, like "...give them a fish/teach them fishing..." story.This thesaurus has enough definitions and based on my humble opinion - a must!
Bought this based on a 5-star review? WHY??: My child is in 3rd grade and must look up synonyms. Very few of the words on her lists are in this book. This is not a helpful book at all. I guess I should buy an adult thesaurus for 3rd grade!
Very disappointing: I love the Scholastic Children's Dictionary however this thesaurus is not a compliment to that item. There are not enough synonyms offered for each word and there are not enough root words. Horrible.
Great!: Caught my 10 yr old's attention and he likes using it! He loves it! Will keep to pass down to his little brother
Scholastic Children's Thesaurus: we have bough this scholastic children's thesaurus for our children's school work and they are using it alot. we like colorful pages and hard cover it is a plus what book travels between kids and rooms.
Poor Descriptions of Indians: The pieces on Fijian-Indians in 'Fiji' and 'The Mynah Birds', in which local Indians are shown up in an ugly and racist manner, are just bad writing. To his credit Michener apologised about his untoward remarks years after the publication of the book.
The voice of Asia: Is this a reprint of "The Voices of Asia?" Som of the reviews read like it might be. I will be reading it, but for now I found 'Voices' to be excellent and would not be surprised to see it reprinted.
Disappointing Sequel: Having read Tales of the South Pacific, one of the classics of 20th Century literature, I couldn't wait to read this 'sequel' by Michener. I wished I hadn't bothered. It seemed as if the great wordsmith was just writing because his publisher demanded to cash in on the success of 'Tales'. Disappointed, I put it down about a third of the way through and never bothered to pick it up again. It takes two to tango - even in a novel. Michener (the author) and I (the reader)danced our way through 'Tales' never missing a step. With the sequel it was if we had two left feet.
Bolero Ranchero: This is an awesome cd for those who enjoy listening to Javier Solis and to Mexican Mariachi music. Great buy.
Interesting espionage mystery: A top secret agency one day has its valued spy jump out the fifth floor window. But was agent Lister's death a suicide or really a murder? Frank Finley plays the agent who suspects something else is behind his death. Lister was entrusted with a huge database of top secret information and he tries to trace who might want to murder him. He uncovers a plan by one of the agency directors to cheat the tax revenue service out of millions of dollars, a plan Lister might have leaked out. But his movements are tracked and he is in danger, too. The first film appearance of Natasha Richardson as a flirty secretary.
Great look at life in Riga: Latvia, My favorite country. This book explains the customs and culture better than any travel guide or text book. On one level it exposes how different life in latvia is compared to the USA, and yet on another level it reveals that young girls growing up in Latvia face the exact same social and emotional problems as girls in the USA (and, I suspect, everywhere else). I bought this book for my daughter and found that I enjoyed it just as much as she did as we read it together.The photos capture the essence of the city so well, we enjoyed seeing places we had visited.A great book and I look forward to other books by this author.James HatsisJames1@OconeeAirService.com
I'm tired of dumb...reviews: ... "The Merry Month of May" is a brilliant, perfectly structured novel which was misunderstood when it was first published, and is apparently still misunderstood. Like Jake Barnes in "The Sun Also Rises," Hartley is a wounded man who finds himself emotionally impotent to help the people he loves most, even when his own godchild's future is in question. He is an observer, in the tradition of Barnes, or Nick Carraway, and to observe is his JOB. His own feelings of guilt and shame come from the very fact that he can't bring himself to act, take sides, or take a stand, even when his friends demand it of him. This is actually, in my estimation, one of the few novels of its time that deals honestly and compassionately with women's true roles in the "sexual revolution" of the Sixties.
Strictly a period piece: The only reason I read this book was because I've just read a book (Saveage Grace) about the Baekwell family who lived in Paris during the 1950's and 1960's, were good friends of James Jones & his wife, and on whom he based the Gallagher family in this novel.The best things I can say about this book is that it's a decent short history of the student uprising in France in 1968 & if you're familiar with Paris at all, it gives an accurate description of the city. Other than that, the book is verbose, its depiction of women woefully sexist and out of date, and gives the reader the cringing feeling one gets when an older person is tring to be "with it." This book definitely has not stood the test of time.
Only a Poet?: I was very surprised that I got through this book. It is not every day that a person will pick up a collection of essays on Classical, Elizabethan and other types of literature, for enjoyments sake. Eliot really outdid himself with his reviews of the literature that he was surrounded by. The definite reads, if you do not want to go through all the essays, are the essays "Dante", "Hamlet and his Problems" and "A Dialogue on Dramatic Poetry". "Dante" is a beuatiful study on both the "Divina Comedia" and "Vita Nouva". "Hamlet" is a putdown on the play that everyone "loves" so much--with the exception of the writer of this sentence. "Dialogue" is a well crafted arguement of the essence of the poetic plays and how they fit into modern--it was written in 1922--times. This book is pure genius, although at points rather "holier-than-thou." Eliot was a genius and he makes sure to let you know it in his essays.
The Dark and Mysterious Side of a Girl Coming of Age: These interconnected short stories are about the dark and mysterious side of a girl coming of age in a small, rural Canadian community. The mundane quality of puberty is intermeshed with sexual awakening. The girl has cold, unfeeling parents who try to instill the values of puritanism vs. sexual curiosity. The stories also deal with domestic violence and other secrets and shame of home life. The stories are all interesting but some require slow reading to really take them in.
A Fine Review of Advanced Mathematics: This Dover reprint is a concise and lucid review of the mathematical foundations of classical and modern physics. Originally published as two volumes, the reprint combines both volumes at a budget price.Topics covered in Volume I:Vector TheoryCalculus of VariationsVectors and Matrics (transformations, eigenvectors, eigenvalues)Vector SpacesHilbert SpaceTopics covered in Volume II:Analytic FunctionsGreen's FunctionsIntegral EquationsGroup TheoryNot for the feint of heart, the book is well written, but it is concise with lots of information packed into a compact space.
Outstanding. A Rare Gem.: I wish all textbooks would be of this high caliber and price. It is one of my favorite books. Don't hesitate to buy it.
Terrific book to ramp up and read original papers: If you're tired of reading descriptive physics like Paul Davies' books and want to be able to read the original papers and follow the math, this is the book. It presumes a strong undergraduate math background in some areas but the explanations are clear and the proofs are easy to follow. If you want to read quantum physics, the chapters on vectors and operators will give you the math foundations.
heatilator gfk21 review: I Purchased this product(heatilator gfk21 fan kit) and it shows up as a bag of parts, similar to the review that was already here. No instructions found. I found some from the heatilator website but they didn't match what I was sent. I returned this product, I didn't want to deal with the headache of "guessing" how to attach it. Dealing with amazon was no problem, but the 3rd party place that sent me the fan didn't have any instructions. good luck!
Very labor intensive: I ordered this to hopefully heat my living area better and lower my energy costs however it didn't come with any instructions and when I contacted the company they sent me a worthless page of instructions lol. If you really know how to install it or you're willing to pay to have it installed go for it.
BURNS if your child has a yeast-related diaper rash!!!: This is the worst product for diaper rash caused by yeast. My 6-year old sweats a lot and got a bit of a yeast infection around his groin, so I put Desitin on it to help it heal and prevent further moisture. Well, he started screaming! I couldn't get the stuff off of him fast enough. A few months later, I had a yeast infection and decided to test it out on me to see if I got the same reaction - YOWZA! It burned so badly I was nearly frantic trying to get the stuff off. It MAY help prevent a rash, but it is NOT recommended if your child already has a rash that might be yeast-related. I feel like the worst parent on the planet for putting this stuff on my two sons when they were babies.
I think Ted Hawkins is wonderful but....: If you're only going to buy one Ted Hawkins CD make sure it's not this one. (Go for "Songs From Venice Beach" or the "Next Hundred Years.")This CD is mainly the "filler" that was cut when the original Venice Beach tapes was reduced from 2 LPs to one CD (Songs From Venice Beach.) The result is that Songs From Venice Beach has most of the best material. However, this CD does have Ted Hawkins singing "Dock of the Bay" and "Chain Gang" without which no Ted Hawkins collection is complete.So if you're a Ted Hawkins fan you do need to buy this CD, just don't buy it first.
CD Review: Lovely sound. Then CD started skipping and does not not play. Not sure why, looks clean, but does not play without skipping all over the place
A book on the Roof of the World!: This book was written from my parent's prospective of living in Labrang, Tibet. The experiences of living where we had no electricity and rode horses when traveling. It is a place of remote traveling and friendly Tibetans, once you get to know them.
Antenna kit: A mediocre performer. It amplifies noise equally so you get the same weak signal in relation to the background.
Good story, good overview of how the markets worked and work...: This was a great read, including the author's charming description of the workings of the internal combustion engine. It also showed how the markets worked and how they continue to work - pretty sad. Good read.
Bernard Baruch : My Story: Bernard Baruch's story is very interesting but I was very disappointed in the quality of this book.
Wonderful Video!: We had recieved this as a gift about 2 years ago and still love it. Very educational and fun to go behind the scenes and watch the zoo staff care for the animals.
The Most understandable book on the subject: I have now bought 3 copies of this marvelous book for friends. Whether you are diabetic or hypoglycemic, this is the answer. Easy explanations; easy charts; easily available foods and preparation. If your blood sugar has been out of control, with this book to guide you, it will never be again.
Missing some key information: There is no mention of how to calculate insulin dosage based on number of carbohydrates in a meal. And that is the whole reason I had bought the book. Sure it tells you how to count carbs, but it doesn't say what you can do with that knowledge.
Not like the Original.: I've used a Stainless Parker Jotter for work since 1990. I've never had a complaint with the original refills. In need of ink on various occasions in the past couple of years I have had to use the Gel Ink. The Gel Ink goes down bold and thick but the tip is not as smooth as the standard refills and the ink is very easily lifted if rain or other liquids come in contact with what you have just written. Another drawback with the amount of ink that gets put down is that a refill may only last a week whereas the original refills would last me months!This complaint may sound a little extreme but one drop onto the shop floor with the tip extended renders the refill useless. This is in stark contrast to the original refills which occasionally I have dropped 2 or 3 times with no adverse effects to the writing ability.Hope this is helpfullShalomMichael
3 packs, each had one working refill: As noted by Flashbizz in his review, the packages all have one refill with a wax covering, and one refill without (and therefore completely dried out). I thought his experience was an aberration, but I ordered 3 packs and each had the same problem. I guess this supplier bought a huge batch of defective ones, and they are dumping them on Amazon. Buyer beware... your two-pack is really a one-pack.
Smooth lines, great color.: These gel ink refills are a significant improvement over the standard ink. Where the other cartridges feel scratchy and require significant pressure to write consistently, these cartridges feel very light and smooth. Much more pleasant.
Gel pens are great, but run out quickly: These gel refills are great. A smooth solid line of ink comes out every time, and it works as well as you'd expect. The down side, with all gel pens, is that they run out of ink much more quickly than regular pens. Keeping that in mind I was still surprised when I had to change the ink after only 3 weeks of daily use. Still think it's worth it, but just realize that you'll be buying these again sooner than you may have anticipated.
1/2 good: As others have said, I received 1 refill that worked and one that didn't. One had the tiny cover on the ball end and one did not.
Doesn't last long enough: Not a huge fan of this product. Love the way it writes but in less than a few months, I'm buying it again. (and there are 2 refills) I decided to switch pens instead.
Spotty preformance: These refills get blotchy ink on the bottom, which I have to wipe off. Also they skip on almost every sentence. Garbage.
poor quality: The ink was older, somewhat crushed and dried up after approximately one week of moderate use. Would not recommend the product.
DRIED OUT: Well I like all parker pens and the gel is the best but on this order all but one refill have the little wax tip off this made the ink dry out so 5 of the 6 I ordered where no good shame others i had gotten have been ok this was the first with them dried out this bad. I am glad I still had one left from other order not sure but i think I will go to office store for my next ones.
Nice Writing "feel": I give the refills 5 stars, but be aware that the first time I ordered these, they just didn't show up. I purchased these to replace the ink in several hand-turned pens I have. Apparently, not all refills are created equal because the first one I bought at a brick and mortar store did not fit.These fit, write well and most importantly to me are available in blue ink. I prefer blue ink so that contract signatures stand out from all the surrounding black text.It's been a busy year, so I'll be ordering more of these soon.
Lousy Batch of what has been a quality product: I've used Parker Gel refills for years. Decided to try to save a little money this year. Instead of buying them from a major office supply store, I went with this Amazon seller. These were not the same quality, even though all the packaging was identical to store-bought. It was as if they were dried out. The gel "went dry"/ran out much sooner than ever before.
Not as expected: Defective and disappointing. Both refills stopped working in 2 days. Very rough and not smooth at all from the first day. Not sure if this pack was just defective or this French made unit is just junk.Not recommended. On the good side, seller sent item very quickly.
Refills for Smith and Wesson Pen: These refills work great. My pen has been submerged in water for long periods of time and the ink still works.
Perfect for the Boxwave Styra: When myBoxWave Capacitive Styraran out of ink, I had to go searching for refills. Nothing was listed on the packaging or the website. I wound up visiting a local office supply shop and, through experimenting with various ones that looked right, finally came across these Parker refills. Perfect match! In fact, the writing tip feels much smoother than the one the pen originally came with. Very happy with this product.
Blue Parker Gel Ink refills: These blue refills are a much lighter blue than the Parker gel refills I purchased at Staples. The first of the two didn't flow well and felt "scratchy" instead of gliding across the paper like the refills I procured from Staples. The first one was so bad I threw it away the first day. I'll throw the second away as soon as I can get to Staples and buy some "good" replacements. I suspect they were not genuine Parker refills, but I don't know for sure.
Nice ink: I like using this ink because it is smooth and writes very well. I get a lot of compliments on how well my pen works when I use it. The only problem I run into is the fact that I use it a lot and the ink runs out kind of fast. However, it is gel ink after all so in that regard is kind of expected. It is also not too expensive, so what's there to lose?
Hard To Find Refills: The best buy around. Great price for a quality product plus fast delivery. Could not find these refills locally and was afraid I would need to retire my old Parker Pen.Then Amazon and this vendor came to the rescue. Will order more in the future if they stay available.
very poor quality: I was only able to write with these refills 2 days each, after this something happens and ink just starts flowing uncontrollaby.Not what I expect from Parker labeled product.
Fast drying gel. Smooth writing.: Like another reviewer, I also purchased these to replace the cartridge in a S&W tactical pen. I really did buy this pen more to just have a nice pen than anything "tactical" about it. This made for an instant upgrade. The pen now writes much more smoothly and the ink dries super fast for gel. If you just bought a nice pen and it came with a junk cartridge, these are for you. If you don't like gel, I'm not sure these will change your opinion, though.
Horrible fluidity: I cannot write even one word without it skipping. Just about every other letter has missing spots (like half the letter) and when I try to go back over them it just leaves a mess that is not acceptable for my own notes let alone any kind of serious correspondence or form filling. I've tried warming it up using scratch paper, using alcohol around the nib, nothing is working.
1/31/12 Dud? 2/23/12 Not A DUD!!!!!!!: Wrote OK at first. After 1 day of use, not able to write with it. Could be that one was a dud. Giving it three stars as a benefit of the doubt. I'll See how the second refill does.2/23/12 Second refill doesn't work!! Disappointed. Revised the 3 star rating to 1. Sorry Parker! But the refills stink!!!
Parker Refills: These refills are high quality. The ink flows smoothly and the refill fits my pen perfectly. The order was delivered in a timely manner which is always appreciated. There were no surprises with this order.
Surprisingly.... boring: Why is it that every new installation in this series not only introduces new characters but also new plot twists?It seems that Mark Anthony is making up the story as he goes along. There are no frameworks, no build up, things just "happen" and there are no explanations... The first book in the series could have been forgiven as the first attempt but the rest? I don't know there are so many good books out there and this isn't one of them unless it was intended for young audiences rather than adults.....
Downhill: Mr. Anthony has went from a good first book in a downhill slide.Ending with the second book and throughout this book the main "heroes" mostly seem to be boy gets boy scenario instead of the usual.Though this may appeal to some,the majority of readers would be more likely to relate to a hero who's after the princess instead of the knight.
Unique Paper Illustrations: Barbara Baumgartner has written down her stories so they can be enjoyed by school-age children. Everyone remembers the story of the clever monkey who outwits the hungry crocodile and children just love these stories.They are greatly enhanced with cut-paper illustrations. You can also make your own puppets to go along with the stories, although they didn't include any patterns to photocopy. That would have been very thoughtful.Otherwise, this book is just delightful. The stories included:Crocodile! Crocodile!Crocodile Hunts for the MonkeyThe Squeaky Old BedHow the Chipmunk Got His StripesThe Grateful SnakeSody SaleratusRichly illustrated with wonderful borders! A must see!~The Rebecca Review
Children will love this...: Children will love this retelling of classic animal tales from all over the world!The illustrations just add the right style to the stories! I bought this for my friend's son, and he loves it! Buy it, you won't be disappointed!
Mostly cacophonic noise: The title of this CD has more to do with the coarseness of the band's sound than anything else I can imagine. It ranges from 12 grit - Ouch! little more than irritating noise - to maybe 60 grit - just enough to tease you into believing there is something special to this band if they can just pull it together for a complete set of tracks (they ARE and HAVE - elsewhere). This may be the worst Madrugada CD available. I can appreciate only maybe 3 1/2 tracks, and one being Majesty, is tiring and forgettable after hearing the transcendant live version from the Tralfamadore session. Buy The Deep End, and Industrial Silence, or if you can stand the cost, the Tralfamadore CD. Don't waste your time or money on this one. If you can't play the CD through without quickly jumping over tracks to save yourself the pain, you aren't missing much.
limited photos: Most of the interviews with Ozzy are done over the phone, while you listen to the interview photo's of Ozzy and other band members flash on the screen. That's where the DVD takes a bad turn, because the same photo's flash over and over. I just feel that there should been more behind the scene's photo's or at least different photo's. Also some of the film footage is shot in black and white out of a car window of passing cars and landscape of England that has nothing to do with Ozzy. Most of the contents are well known facts about Ozzy and his life so for the collecting fan this will be a disapointment, but for a new fan it will help them understand a little of Ozzy's history.
Bad Film Makers Trying to Ride Wave of Ozzy Popularity: The disclaimer at the beginning of this 'documentary' pretty much says it all (paraphrasing): "There's not a shred of original Ozzy music played in this film, and it isn't endorsed in any way by the Ozzy Camp" (i.e. it sucks). 5 minutes into this film the horrible soundtrack (a $10 drum machine, I think) and the redundant use of still photographs with cheesy "effects" was almost too much to take. This film is a eclectic bag of snippets, poor quality sound bits and bytes from old Ozzy interviews, and "enhanced" photos slapped together by some of the least talented people I can imagine. An obvious ploy to ride the wave of Ozzy popularity to their benefit - don't buy this DVD, they don't deserve the revenue. I'd change my review to no stars if I could, and Ozzy should sue these losers for putting his name on this worthless dribble. Love Ozzy, hated this DVD.
Malta Magnificent: I have been searching for a copy of this book for years. My Father was mentioned in this book and had a copy of it but my younger sister has it.I think this book gives a very good indication of how Malta was abused in the war. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel.
Itasca hikers: First of all, the shoes received were not as pictured --- they were not low-top hikers, they were higher topped like boots. Then, they were too narrow. Did not come in anything but medium width.
B for BAD: Never buy it! I wasted 25 bucks for this stupid thing. Didnt even fit me. Dont get fooled by the picture in the web. Here's my story.Payed $26...a $8 for shipping alone.I was eagerly waiting for this. Even the most local brands will send the shoes in a box. well, I got it in a dirty white cover! with black marks all over it. And it comes with a 5 pound load of ads(now I know why the shipping cost was high...)The lace and the spongy stuff in it is all in GREEN color. know what i mean....anyone can spot your shoe even a mile away....its so glaring GREEN!The lace allignment is all distorted. Doesn't even look decent. I am right now looking at returning this thing.My advice....DONT BUY IT!
Unfortunately not suitable for serious hiking: I have these boots and unfortunately have to agree with the majority of the reviews. I'm not a fan of coming on here and trashing a product, but I felt like this was warranted. I got them cheap and was excited for what I expected to be a serviceable pair of hiking boots. I was very disappointed. I've only worn them a few times, and each time they have left my feet aching horribly. The soles, as others have stated, are inexcusably thin. Mine haven't split or broken, but they leave the bottom of my feet hurting because of the lack of support. The entire boot is unstable. They aren't suitable for anything more than a leisurely stroll. Don't purchase these expecting to do any serious hiking and not be in pain by the end of the day. Get a real pair of hiking shoes.
DO NOT ORDER!!!!! MIAMI VICE GEEN IS ALL THEY HAVE AVAILABLE.: I ordered these in brown on brown - the most hideous shade of green arrived. When I called the vendor, Fogdog said they no longer have the brown on brown - yet they are still listing them for sale on Amazon. DO NOT BE FOOLED - YOU WILL GET SOME UGLIFIED MIAMI VICE GREEN BOOTS!!! YUCK! 5 days before Christmas and I have to go shopping again!
Not so hot: Always seems like the area under heal fall aparts on these inexpensive hikers, these did the same thing.If you were to wear these hikers just for special occasions they are great, and very comfortable too, no beak-in needed.But don't expect to get a lot of life out of them.
Leather trim cracking/peeling after 1 week: I agree with others the boot is suitable for only light wear. Support is average to poor. And after 1 week the leather trim has started to crack and peeI. I put oil on it and this seems to have stopped the process. Other than that, I have no issue with color or style. And it was VERY inexpensive, 21 dollars and change, free shipping. The delivery and condition of shoes was fine. If you do get them because of the price, just be aware they're only suitable for basically walking around town. And you'll probably have to replace the insole with a better one, and treat the leather trim to prevent it from peeling/cracking.
Bad, Bad Leroy Brown.: The shoes themselves? Not bad. The very fact that I too were sent the green (ugly green) ones when I paid for the brown ones? Bad. And it seems to be a problematic thing. Find these where you know you'll get what you pay for.
wasn't able to refill: When I tried to have the color cartridge refilled at Walgreen's, they said it did not "pass" their electical test and they couldn't refill it.
Rocco's gone loco.: Rocco got fired from the ticket and basically lost his mind.This guy used to hack me off when he was on the radio, now I can hack him off....Hey Rocco, I live in a gated community and drive a Hummer. Oh, and I stole your book.
The Village Idiot Grows Up: One chapter isn't bad reading, if you're a Tickethead. The hockey stories are pretty interesting, also. Unfortunately, his ramblings about the environment are an all-too-painful reminder of the cluelessness that made his Dallas radio show unlistenable. Making a long story short, the village idiot may have grown up, but he didn't get any smarter.
If you like typos and poor editing, this book is for you: I don't think anyone edited this book. After getting through all the misspelled words and run-on sentences, I was convinced that I had died and gone to reading hell. These weren't ramblings; these were incoherent thoughts and meaningless stories that were pretty unrelated. The only saving grace is that this guy's wheels are so far off, that you can't help but laugh at him.
Not sized correctly: My normal size is 6.5. These shoes were way too big - enough excess space in the toe box for two fingers width from the top of my toe. The shoes stated they were 6.5, so, I had to send them back. I really liked the color, so I am still searching.
An excellent game: My 5 year old loves this game and has been playing it since she was 4. She's a pro at the game and never gets sick of it.
not: Mouse tracking is horrible.Controls don't work smoothly.Even the menu interface is bad.How can you get this wrong? Some menus are missing a 'return', and Esc does not take you back. Instead, you need to use the delete key above the arrows (not documented, and certainly counterintuitive). Even clicking on the menu items is awkward, with the cheesy pointer and poorly laid out hot spots.Feels more like a something someone had hacked together in their spare time.I hope it's just the result of a poorly executed port from PC to Mac.This was a xmas gift, which after a few minutes of frustration, was thrown in the trash.
annoying: i bought this for my cousin so that we could play it together cause we both like disney games but when you come to the second level it stops being fun cause you have to paddle down the river avoiding whirlpools or you will be stuck in them and not be able to get out after an hour of trying this game went into the trash
Great for your collection....But doesn't teach!: I enjoyed the book, because it was a willow book, however it is very hard to read. I found myself skimming it, disappointed there were so many black and white photos. Very wordy, with little substance, if you are looking for a book to increase your knowledge in collecting, this isn't the book. It is the book, though, to add to your collection if you just want more willow "stuff". New collectors, stick with the tried and true Gaston book. No value to me, just his research, which I'm sure may be valuable to some. But...to each his own....enjoy!
Terrible!!! Only 8% of daily needed calcium in THREE vitamins!!!: I really wish Amazon would list ingredients in their vitamins so we know what we're getting. In this instance, I was upset to see that taking the THREE vitamins a day you need with this bottle only amounts to 8% of your daily needed value of calcium (75mg)!! You get more calcium drinking a glass of MILK and that would be much, much cheaper. Do yourself a favor and don't throw away money on this product. You can buy a whole-food calcium vitamin on Amazon called Rainbow Light, which has 50% of your daily needed calcium (500mg) and higher amounts of all other minerals/ingredients (e.g. magnesium) for a lot less money. I'm going to try that next!
pretty bad: I didn't have any problems assembling it, but I do have three main complaints:1) Either the music piece or the spinning piece makes a horrible grinding noise pretty much constantly which I think leads to:2) Sometimes, fully wound, it just stops, perhaps because of the friction produced from point one. But a lot of times, hours later, it starts up again. My twins can sleep through anything, but man, talk about spooky, music boxes just starting up in the middle of the night. I know, I watch too many horror movies.3) The way the part that spins connects to the spinning mechanism, it's possible (and actually pretty likely) that the spinning hook will get a few rotations around before the plush part catches up, which makes the plush part jolt into action and spin a few times really fast.My kids don't have any issue with it, but for the amount of money I paid, I expected something with a bit more quality.
How could a company ever produce this??: We purchased this mobile to go with the matching nursery set. I still can't believe how bad it is. Within a minute the string that attaches the mobile to the device that spins it broke. I decided to use a zip tie to patch it to see if my son even liked it. He did but it has too many design flaws to go with it's poor quality. The tree is just a plush toy with no support, so the limbs sag making the animals hang low. Even with that sagging of the limbs some of the animals get stuck against the holding arm. When that happens you have to give it a nudge to get it spinning again. The mobile is powered by a wind up that lasts about 2 minutes. The music quality is low and after a few days of use the mechanism in the wind up started making constant loud noise.I'm returning this piece of crap before anything else happens. I'm half expecting one of the stuffed animals to suddenly explode.
Disappointing: The animals are cute. Assembly is (for the most part, see below) easy, and it attaches well to our crib.The music is loud and the quality is AWFUL. I suspect it might induce nightmares rather than an actual desire to sleep. I don't expect that we'll use it. Ever. Which is too bad, because it means that we'll have to turn the mobile by hand since the two features do not operate independently. However, as another reviewer noted, one of the animals/palm tree arms is too big to fit past the arm assembly as it turns in any case.The pieces all clipped together easily except for the music box; the hook on the arm attachment has insufficient space to allow the music box portion to slide on. We'll need a zip tie or an s-hook to complete assembly.I feel as though this product did not actually go through a thorough QA process - they missed the part where they tried all of the pieces together.
Not well built: I was excited to purchase this mobile for my sons crib. Especially because it matched the crib set. I was even more excited that at about 2 months old my son loved the music and stuffed animals. I was angered when at my sons 3 month mark the mechanism that rotates the stuffed animals and makes the music broke. I am very disappointed by the build quality of the mechanical aspect of this mobile.
My son loves it!!!: We have the whole Jungle Babies collection, the mobile keeps my sons attention locked in on the cute little animals that match the collection perfectly. The music does last only a couple minuets before needing to be wound again. The music is cute and enjoyable. Great construction and durable have had for 3 years now, currently being used by my second son.
Fully wound, it only works for 2.5 minutes and is way too loud: We got the Jungle Babies theme for our son's room and generally love all the stuff -- the one thing that lacks is the mobile -- it only lasts 2.5 minutes, and is far too loud for putting a baby to sleep. I wouldn't buy this even for $3.
Wonderful and Motivating Book: When I began to read this book I first thought that I would be reading a book similar to a book about the Appalachain Trail or a Wilderness book. Although he writes about some of his expierence walking in the wilderness he mostly writes about the people he meets and the life lessons he learns.I was shocked at the end when he finished the book in New Orleans but he writes that he will continue his walk Westward across America and then write about it.If you are expecting a book about being out in the Wilderness this is not it, but if you want to read about a guys stories about his hike from NY to New Orleans with his best pal as a dog I suggest this.
Stumbled upon the book, could not put it down!: Absolutely one of the best reads that I've ever encountered. Of course, throughout this book, I continued to hopelessly imagine myself taking this journey along with Peter. Its just a down to earth, true speaking, journey across the eastern US. I wish I could have been there to experience it too. Great read!
Quick Read - Good Book; Could have been GREAT!!: I very much enjoyed this book. It was a quick read and left a very favorable impression on the how each of us can rise above our preconceptions of others. Some very deep and probing subjects were only brushed upon which to some extent allows each of us to fill in the depth based on our experiences. However, I would have loved to hear more of how the hermit in the mountain became so "magical" for him. Also, at the end, everything races forward at a pace well beyond and out of sync with the beginning of the story. I highly recommend the book and wished that the journey lasted a lot longer so as to more fully explore some of the more magical and cathartic experiences in this person's life.
Slightly dated but worth reading: This is a very good book that captures a period in American history that is rapidly fading. Not quite as good as "Blue Highways" by Least Heat Moon, but most definitely very well told and a recommended read. If for no other reason, read this book to reflect on ways of living that Washington careerists are set out to destroy and erase from America.
Great book: Great story of going on a journey to find one's place in life. It's an interesting look into some of the less visited places in America.
Naive, but honest...: I was given this book as a kid by a nice old man at my church. I stopped going to church in my teens and am now agnostic. I have since become very critical of religion and my country (mainly the government and our corporate culture). However I think it's important not to become too cynical. In writing a review of this book I find it necessary to point this out because it is a very simply told, innocent story written by a young man who is not a professional writer or an intellectual. He's just a normal, young guy who walked across America and wrote about it with no secret intentions. As a result you get a very entertaining and heartfelt old fashioned adventure story through America's heartland. If you're looking for anything deeper, then you're reading the wrong book.
great condition: I bought this for my husband that was reading the series. It came in great condition. He was suprised and loves the book.
Re-read this after many years and still enjoyed it.: Loved walking Peter and Cooper's journey with them, interacting with all the people they met along the way, and the descriptions of places they saw were wonderful. What a great way to experience the Appalachian Trail!
Wonderful Book About Travels Hiking Across the US in the 1970s: I found this book at my parents house stashed away somewhere. What a find! It was an original copy from 1979. If you enjoy travel novels (Such as Bill Bryson's a "Walk in the Woods") you will really enjoy this book. The book took me both across the country and back in time.As someone in his 20s I can identify with the author and the way he felt at the start of his journey. But this book was set in the mid 70s, just under a decade before I was born. It is interesting to hear about all the people he meets along the way, and what America was like in 35 years ago. Jenkins paints a very vivid picture of the places he visits and the people he meets along the way. He also goes on an inner journey of self discovery. From a lost recent college grad disillusioned with the US he gains an appreciation for his country and a better understanding of himself. I really enjoyed it and even ordered a copy for one of my friends.
Moving Adventure, well-told, Makes you proud of American ppl: Peter goes on an incredible journey with his best friend, Cooper, and takes us along with well-told chapters, each covering a different section of the hiking trail. He tells of the many Americans he comes across, most of them good-hearted, generous people who offer him unconditional hospitality and love. He doesn't say much of the technicalities of trail life itself, so it is not really a good hikers guide. This is more like a collection of individual stories, each with their own theme and lesson and his own revelations he discovers about himself and the world. What's great is that he discovers himself in the most complete way any human being could that it seemed like it was fate that he needed to take that hike. What a great, story-book ending to true-life non-fiction novel.
It's Great: Love this book. I've read a library copy 3 or 4 times and wanted my own. It arrived in great condition, and I'll enjoy reading it again and again.
Great theme, bad writing.: Walking across America is quite an endeavour, to write a book about it another. The theme of the book is very interesting, however the style of writing is very dramatic which is a bit tiresome. Jenkins experiences are either rated as total bliss or complete catastrophe, and unfortunately so are the people he meets. The book bleaches in comparison with Krakauers "Into the Wild". I did buy the sequel before reading this book and will actually read it because I really like the theme. Hopefully Jenkins has matured on the next section of his walk.
Disappointing: I read a few other reviews where the writing in this book was described as amateur, lacking focus and ham-fisted (what a great word). The premise of this book is so great but the author's poor writing style and lack of meaning is incredibly disappointing. The book feels like a work log of what he did every day and misses so many opportunities to share insight and depth. One of my favorite inconsistencies is when the author shares that he has been a strict vegetarian for the prior 3 years and then only 13 pages later describes how he orders 15 "big-man" burgers from a fast food drive in. What?!?!I was generous and gave this book a 2 because I really like the idea of seeing the country by walking across it. Unfortunately the title was probably the best part of the book. Don't waste your time on this one.
Boring!: Reading this book for a book club, I found it incredibly boring and superficial. Peter spends 3 days on the mountain with Homer and writes nothing of depth about this amazing mountain man. Peter's writing is pedestrian. He talks about wanting to discover America and yet only writes about people when someone else directs him to! Someone told him he had to go see Homer the Mountain Man. This was the first people story after 7 weeks of walking. Homer was a character and shared himself with Peter and yet Peter is insensitive and self-absorbed in his responses to Homer. The next story in the book written about actual people is when someone directs him to spend the night in the police station. There Peter talks to a Vietnam Vet. Peter writes that the Vet's stories would awaken a person from a 6 month coma and then writes NOTHING about those conversations. Wasted opportunities. The concept of the book is a great idea, but the writing is juvenile.
Amateurish prose: I believe Mr. Jenkins must have been paid by the exclamation point, so liberal is he with their use. While his story should be interesting to the wanderers among us, his telling of it is so hamfisted that I just couldn't bear to continue. Jenkins needs a harsher editor or better yet, a ghost-writer. This book reads like a high-school senior's lengthy "personal narrative" for a college admissions essay. But perhaps I'm being too generous.
Suitable for an 8th grade reading list: I just finished this book and want my money back. I felt like I was expected to write a book report after reading this. If this book is any indication, I won't insult my inteligence by reading any more of his work. He didn't even make it "across" the US in any meaningful sense of the term. In THIS book that is. For the entire trip west, you have to buy the sequel. Sounds like someone is milking a story...I do envy him his journey. The entire reason I bought this book was to learn about the logistics of undertaking such a long hike, as I plan on walking from the east coast to the west coast someday. Unfortunately he would rather write of his love affair with his "forever friend" and make up lame similes for every little thing he encounters. I would give an example, but I've already given away the book.In my opinion, check your local library or buy it in a quarter bin at a flea market. Any more time or money invested in this book is a waste.
Not for a Lazy Weekend Afternoon: Ugh, ugly book. This book, while original, was definitely not a book I'd sit down and read on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't worth my time, and I doubt it will be worth yours.Peter Jenkins, author and protagonist, decides to walk across America for no good reason besides curiosity. He takes an exaggerated super-dog named Cooper with him. He explores all different aspects of society in his quest and eventually finds himself a girl and gets married. Many things in this I find hard to believe. The author believes that Cooper and himself share a level of implied communication of feelings to each other (implying that the animal is sentient). The some of the ridiculous characters encountered represent the crazies of American society. The lack of interesting plot left me gasping for something solid.The only thing and I found that I liked in this book was that the author found God in the end and felt the power of God affect his life.
What a Great Book!: A Walk Across America was a wonderful book. The book was full of adventure. Peter Jenkins, the author, hikes from New York to Louisiana with his trusty dog, Cooper. This book allows the reader to take a wild journey. Peter discovers what it is like to be truly hungry, to travel in the mountains, to live in very different cultures, to make new friends, and to learn about religions. This book contains interesting photographs that bring the stories to life. One thing amazing about this book is that it is a true story. Peter Jenkins actually "walked across America." After reading this book I felt energized. Knowing I can go anywhere and do anything if I put my mind to it. I would recommend this book to others. You won't be able to put it down.
Not the best writing, but definitely a story worth reading.: Well, it's been over a year since I read this book, and yet it still constantly echoes in my mind. Essentially, A Walk Across America is a collection of encounters with enlightening individuals, each who shares something about their lives that will stay with you forever. At times I was disappointed with Jenkins' style; his writing skills are not on par with John Irving, for example, but he definitely gets his point across.
A Walk Across America Review: I really enjoyed the book, A Walk Across America. The book reminded me that life is not about the destination; it is about the journey and the sights you see, the things you do, the memories you create and the people you love. This book reminded me that life is the journey, and in the journey you find out who you are and what you stand for. Peter Jenkins is a great author, and this is a must read!
A Most Terrific Walk: I can promise you that I haven't read more than one book in the past ten years, but from the moment I picked up "A Walk Across America" I couldn't set it down. I read it cover to cover in three days and ordered "The Walk West" and "Along the Edge of America" immediately. This book is for anyone who loves the outdoors, dogs, adventure or just a heartfelt excellent story. I now plan on reading anything and everything that Peter Jenkins writes. I sent a copy of this book as a gift for my son in Florida. Thank you Peter for sharing with us your wonderful story.
Warning: I read this book in 1986 while in the Marine Corps stationed at Pearl Harbor. After geting out of the service I still haven't settled down. I,ve trekked from Florida to Alaska to India and beyond with no sight of settling down and no reason to.Jenkins lit a fire in my conciousness that stirred an unquenchable couriosity. This book should have a disclaimer warning that you may just bag what is expected of you and find your own path.This is a heartfelt account of one mans journey. Be careful!! You just might do it yourself.
A Life Altering Book: I received a copy of A Walk Across America as a Christmas gift. Now exactly one month later I have finished not only that book but the sequel, A Walk West. Being a college student I do not have much time to read outside of my assigned readings. However with both of these books I set aside time to read them and most importantly contemplate what Mr. Jenkins was saying. I am 19 and Mr. Jenkins wrote this book over twenty years ago expressing thoughts and concerns that most teen-agers share today. I applaud Mr. Jenkins and thank him for sharing his story. Every child who is unsure about there path in life or is sure needs to read this book.
Good walkers don't [necessarily] make good writers: I was disappointed in this book. The author is not a strong writer. He tries to compensate for it by being overly dramatic, which only makes some passages border on the absurd, such as worrying about the "shark-infested waters" while crossing a bridge over an inlet of Lake Ponchartrain!With a personal narrative it's also important for the reader to form a bond with or at least take an interest in the narrator. I found that difficult to do with what the author gave me to work with.Frankly I'm surprised this book sold so well. I agree with another reveiwer that "Blue Highways" is a much better written book of this genre.
dragonfly: This book was very cheap.My child needed it for class and we got it super fast..I well order from them again..
A spiritual journey; a humble search rewarded: One of the books that has had a greater impact on me. This is personal testimony of a young man who set out walking across half of America, disillusioned with the world he knew. Along the way he will discover people who will show him a different way to look at life.Written in a simple style, with humility and candidness. A spiritual journey that we have the privilege to witness, and that can be a great benefit for those who sit at home prisoners of their empty selfs. A portrait of rural America, of real people and of real places. Real life always excells fiction. A most highly recommended book, don't lose this opportunity and read it.
"Attitude Check" review: I found this album online after having already acquired Mike Ridley's "One of a kind" album elsewhere. If it had been the other way around, I would never have come to know the latter, because "AC" is "not good" - a lot of juvenile & vulgar stuff, very few keepers. Needless to say I was very disappointed, when I know how good an artist Mike is.
wonderfully crazy: This journal of Ginsberg, alone and with his friends, is insighful and crazy. Using long narrations and scattered poetry he lets us into his thoughts on just about everything. A must read for any Ginsberg fan.
Horrible: This was supposed to be a plug and play. And i had to customize to make work. Do not order this item. Not plug and play like seller says!
T-Harness for Bulldog remote start...: After getting the correct T-Harness from Amazon it worked as claimed. It save about a third of the time when installing my Bulldog remote start by not needing to cut and connect several wires..
One Goal: You probably already read some of the previous (great) reviews. I do agree with most of what was written so I will not be repeating that information. But I do give you a tip; buy, or borrow a book of Paul Gauguin's art, and read this novel watching the paintings. Then you will realize the great descriptions Mr. Llosa gives of the paintings and their meaning. It's Stunning.As for the second person references, it isn't that anoying, although at the end they are a little too common; but somehow they give you a link with Flora and Paul, maybe an empathic link.The characters are very well researched, realistic, with lots of flaws (like everyone) and hopes, past mistakes, glorious victories... but with one common goal - the search for paradise.
My purchase: I had a Bad Brains Cd I liked however did not care for this DVD. A lot of people obviously like it though so for a true punk fan this may be for you.
David Jay Brown is Exceptional!: Author David Jay Brown does it again - a wild and wicked trip into the secret places of our mind through a delicious fantasyland of science fiction. Or is it? One has the feeling DJB has been there himself. How else could he describe the alien experience in such exquisite detail? Brown has an extraordinary gift for communicating on a verbal, artistic and emotional level simultaneously. Me? I'll read anything Brown writes. You? Read this book only if you're a mental adventurer with a true appreciation for literary genius... and the willingness to jump gleefully over the edge.
phantasmagorical entertainment tour: Virus is a wonderful escapade through the amazing world of MultiplePersonalities as seen from the eyes of an alien - or is it the world of an alien as seen from the eyes of...Either way, who else could have dreamed up such a phantasmagorical trip through the dimensions of mind?I'm impressed!
great and colorful: These socks looked amazing on my daughter she wore them for a halloween costume. They were comfy and kept her legs warm.
Very Very Good: Awesome,great colors,bright,and great! but only con is that it is a little tight at the thigh but don't let that throw you off these are great!
too tight thigh highs: Too tight above the knees, and I have skinny legs. I had to give to a friend. I would not recommend buying this unless you are a stick figure.
Lots of Fun: I thought that these would look sexy and fun on my girlfriend and they do!They seem like they're high quality and I think they'll last a while.They are a little tight at the top but other than that they're great.
Did not match the photo!: These were disappointing only because they weren't rainbow like the photo, just random colors. Although we could have sent them back my other daughter wanted them so we decided to keep them.
They did the trick ;): Very nice fit. My husband loved them! And I enjoy just sitting around in them because they are warm lol.
Not the product that was ordered.: I received these from my wishlist and they aren't thigh highs. They are leg warmers. NOT THE SAME. I am highly disappointed.
rock the sox!: These are the best socks ever! Amazon is so awesome because I ordered these on monday and received them on wednesday! I even ordered 2 pairs. I have received so many compliments on them because they are incredibly bright. Don't hesitate to buy these..they are a must!
Way awesome gift for a girlfriend or wife: I buy tube socks for my girlfriend alot, i just like them. These are a for sure necessity for any guy who likes a girl in tube socks. They dont slide down and come right up to the thigh at the perfect length. Not costly, sexy accessory for a cute girlfriend or wife.
Cheap and poor quality: I bought these for my wife and when they arrived we pulled them out of the package to discover many problems. They are very cheap socks to begin with and after examining further I discovered that one of the socks at a dime sized hole in it and the other was unraveling at the toes. There are good thigh high sicks out there, but these aren't one of them
Fun Fun: My grandson is 3 and he sat and watched this whole video and it was so fun to see him smiling and laughing! He always asks to watch Micky again when he comes over
Disney Free: My daughter loves this movie. It is a classic Disney picture. Themes are subtle and easy watching. Allows child to draw their own conclusions. A family favorite from the first viewing.
What's with the lame narration?: I loved Mickey and the Beanstalk as a kid. The version I recall was pleasantly narrated by Disney voice actor, Sterling Holloway (Winnie the Pooh). This edition is narrated and intercut with cheesy comedy relief from live actors and puppets. It was so annoying I couldn't even finish the cartoon. If you enjoyed the cartoon-only Mickey and the Beanstalk, find another version. This one will only frustrate you.
Not the best: A Disney movie with Mickey Mouse on the cover..... I thought you couldn't go wrong. I was wrong. This movie was not what I expected or hoped for. It was pretty lame. Even my young kids were disappointed.
disappointing: This 'movie' is really only two stories and no fun. the first is a story of a circus bear wanting to live in the wild. He escapes and meets a girl bear who slaps him. This apparently means she loves him. He won't slap her so the mean bear gets her and they battle it out. Second story is the Mickey Jack and the Beanstock, which I loved as a kid, but it is narrated by a weird guy with puppets. I'm sure this was great in the 60's but this is not even close to PC and the stories actually suck. That's right, I said it. It sucked.
forced to watch commercials: i'm with vince o'sullivan. disney FORCES you to watch their stinking commercials BEFORE you can watch your movie because they're a bunch greedy suits.
Splice out the Edgar Bergan interruptions and reissue the film!: Maybe he was popular at the time, but the narration interruptions by Edgar Bergan and his scary puppets are horribly annoying. My 3 year old kids can't watch this video because they start screaming that the TV is broken every time the video cuts from the animated story to the live action black and white footage of Edgar bergan explaining the story to his evil-looking puppets and annoying child actor assistant. By the same token they can't stand the stupid puppet sequences in Caillou videos (which are not present on the actual PBS airings of Caillou).Disney should re-issue a new version of this DVD with all of the Edgar Bergan/evil puppet sequences edited out.
Good if you like Older cartoons: I thought this was a newer Disney cartoon when I saw this cover, however it was an older style cartoon, the content was good, it just wasnt for me because my daughter is very young and didnt pay attention to it as much as the newer Mickey Animations.
All ok!: We received the disc on time and it worked very well. We enjoyed watching the movie with the children, several times now.
Too much other stuff: It has a lot of other little segments or shows that are not Mickey. My son wants only Mickey so when the other stuff came on he was uninterested. Not that those other things were bad, we were just expecting all Mickey.
Fun And Fancy Free by Walt Disney: Very disappointing. Neither the three year old nor I liked this. I regret spending my precious dollars on this program.
Great Movie!!!: I was feeling down, and this movie really picked me up. I remember watching it as a kid, and unlike some childhood films, it's still good.
Disappointing: The only reason I purchased this DVD was so I would have a good copy of of Mickey and the Beanstock, one of my favorites.I was really disappointed when I watched it and discovered that I did not have the original version of Mickey and the Beanstock.Instead there is this version with ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his dummies reading the story to a little girl. I wouldn't have minded if it was just an introduction, but Edgar Bergin and the dummies keep making comments throughout the entire cartoon.This was a complaint I always had with the Walt Disney show when it was on. They would take classic cartoons that originally played in theaters re-edit them and show them on TV. Sometimes they would take bits from several different cartoons and combine them to make a show that had a certain theme. I hated that. I want to only see the original theatrical version - and this DVD is not it.
concerning messages to our youth: Although the granddaughter wants to watch Mickey- she looses interest before Mickey even makes an appearance. And while there are good messages about worrying less- it is concerning to watch the bears smack each other around -all in the name of love. Domestic violence is difficult enough for children to endure without the confusing message that it really is a show of love. If you are looking for a Mickey Mouse tape for your child or grandchild, I would pick something else.
Too Many Forced Previews: The cartoons are okay, but I don't really care for all the previews. I have to hit the next button severl times before I can get to the main menu and if I don't do this I will end up owning the entire Disney library.
Where is the Ward Kimball Naration?: The Mickey and the Beanstalk portion of the DVD is fine, except for the fact that the live action keeps popping in. While this is all fine and well for those with nostalgia for that type of thing, it absolutely ruins the flow of the movie. A much better version (the version I remember seeing) had Ward Kimball narating. There were no interuptions in the animation and it flowed a lot better. Unfortunately, there is no DVD out there with the Ward Kimball naration, so if you love the animation like I do, you're kinda stuck.
Not what I was expecting: This is not the Mickey and The Beanstalk that I remember -- this one included creepy marionette howdy doody-ish puppets live action that my toddler was afraid of! I was even slightly skeeved by the puppets, and seriously, why was this little girl alone at a party with an adult male puppet weirdo?Ok anyway -- whenever the live action sequences came on (which is pretty often) my kid would cry MICKEY! MORE MICKEY! We had to do a lot of fast-forwarding. Definitely not worth the 1.99 download.
didn't watch: We never got to watch it. It said there was a "region error" and wouldn't play in my area. There should have been an alert on the sellers end stating where it was being shipped to and that it wouldn't play there. Very disappointing!
History of Southwestern Pennsylvania Remembered: I bought this book for my grandfather in January of 2000. He immigrated to America with my grandmother and father from Lago, Calabria, Italy and worked as a miner and mine rescue worker in Pennsylvania during the days of H.C. Frick.He turned 91 in December of 1999, but he vividly remembered his days in those mines until his death in April of 2000, when black lung finally weakened his heart, causing him to pass. Reading this book was one of the final acts of his long, admirable and often difficult life, and he assured me that this book portrays conditions inside the mines and in the company towns very accurately. The book tells the tales of the coal barons, but it is much more. It recalls the coal mining region's contribution to the building of the United States and is a testament to the immigrant spirit of those who made it possible.
Why hasn't this book become a movie??: This book describes so well the history of Southwestern Pennsylvania's coal and coke industry.Enjoyed it thoroughly. It would make a great movie!
not a very good C book: well, this book has proven handy for reference and review, but i would certainly NOT recommend it. the author repeatedly used obscure functions(imho) that were prone to bugs, and he introduced totally new concepts in breif 10-word sentences only to use them all-too-frequently in most examples following. yes, im a 16 year-old, shift-key-fearing mexican, but i've seen good code, and mr.bacon's code doesn't fool me. if you want to take full advantage of this book, read the ENTIRE THING in one sitting so every little concept sticks with you throughout, and don't you dare approach a computer without reading a book that emphasizes on structure, organization, and clean, effective code first
An EXCELLENT text on C/UNIX for programmers of all levels!: Overall a VERY nice book, this is NOT hard reading. I am definitely impressed. The text is very readable, and the concepts come across crystal clear. The number and content of the examples are very appropriate, and the performance tips, tips of the trade, pitfalls, etc. are VERY insightful...I would recommend this book to ANYONE who is or is thinking about programming C and/or running UNIX!
Very practical approach for learning programming under Unix: I wish this had been my First C programming book. It teaches all the basics required for you to start some worthful programming under *nix. It doesn't go into as many details for e.g., as given in 'C programming: A modern Approach by King but it still gives many details on what things are. It starts with basics of Unix and provides a lot of information on the C development tools in *nix. A very good starting point for learning programming in C under *nix.
Wonderful!: This is a book I keep reading again and again. It just is a terrific read. If you're interested in the history of early America, then this is THE series for you!
Flagstaff: I might have given this more stars, however the book has never been received. It is now mid Dec and was slated for delivery by Nov 24. I emailed the seller, but to date have received no response. I am very disappointed.
No effect: Maybe I'm not taking it correctly, but I've tried this formula on an empty stomach as recommended for the past couple of weeks; one capsule per day. I have not noticed any change to me cognitive functioning or energy level.
awful: this product did nothing for me. what a hoax!! wouldn't recomend it, no way. very sorry I bought it in the first place.
How could this be 500 MG???: I'm wondering if the dosage on this capsule is REALLY correct. The capsule does zip -- you get a vague energy buzz, but nothing sensational or really "rhodiola" feeling. This is more like caffeine. I am sure that either the processing of this herb is off base, or they have included some other ingredient that flavors the way it feels when you take it. Not at all like the quality Rhodiola from Siberia.
Strangely Low Powered for Such A High MG Dose: This product must have very low percentages of active ingredients. I don't get much effect from it, despite the fact that it is two or three times "stronger" by MG dose than the Swedish product I normally take. I'm very surprised. Was expecting a huge boost of Rhodiola -- not much happened.
16 Singing Men, "Carols of Christmas": I would recommend this CD even though it is remastered from vinyl. The original "Master" tape has been lost. In 1996 I recorded a DAT tape for Dick Anthony that contained this Zondervan vinyl album. Mr. Anthony used this DAT for his remaster onto CD. The DAT tape I made was not well done and the quality of this reissue CD reflects the surface noise that is prevalent on vinyl(I never intended the DAT to be used as a master). The song "Star and Septer" is particularly noisy. The rest of the songs are OK but there is still the occasional "tic" from the vinyl. I have over 800 Christmas LP's in my personal collection. I would rate this CD/Album number one. The a cappella music that was crated by the 16 Singing Men is some of the finest.Jim Guild
A MUST HAVE For All Babies: This has to be one of the best products on the market! Now that my daughter is pregnant with my first grandchild, I have been doing a lot of shopping and research. My sister-in-law filled this with orange wedges and handed it to her then very fussy 8 month old and I couldn't believe the instant peace. She swears by this product. It can be filled with just about anything. Cold products are great in here for teething babies, and it's a great way to give infants fresh fruit without the risk of choking. I have to admit it can be messy, but what doesn't get messy with babies? My new grandbaby will deffinately have A Baby Safe Feeder!
I must be missing something: I used this twice, once with a teething biscuit and once with banana and found it impossible to clean. Washed it several times then put it through the dishwasher and what came out was a disgusting mess. I threw it away. Everyone else here seems to love them - what am I missing?Also, Target sells a version by Munchkin that's less than half the price.
I'd save your money...: This item seems like a good idea, but after purchasing two I feel that we've fallen victim to "new parent baby marketing". Our baby wasn't interested at all in sucking on anything in it. She woudln't even go for fruits that we knew she loved. I'm guessing the mesh is too distracting or annoying to them(?) She would just shake it around, bang it, or throw it. Also, it's a total pain to clean it. The netting never gets clean in the dishwasher.Save your money on this one.
good for some foods: Some foods worked great in this but it only frustrated my baby with some others. By the time she mastered holding the handle she was moving into "pick em up" foods anyway. Good for ice for teething when they are little. Dogs can chew thru the mesh :(
my daughter can't get her mouth around it: I tried this after reading the great reviews. My 10 month old daughter never sucks on the mesh part but just uses the handle as a teether. Even when she puts her mouth to the mesh - she just sucks on the mesh but not at the food inside.Needless to say I am dissappointed...
It stinks!!!: I think the idea is great, but obviously the person that created it never had to clean a banana from it!!! I spent 2 hours and there were still places that it was impossible to clean. I don't want to give my daughter a fruit in something that may have bacteria from the previous fruit that was placed in it.... I used it just once and never again. It is impossible to have the baby safe feeder 100% clean with a fruit like a banana.
Worth Every Penny!!: I had seen this product in the store, but had put off buying it thinking it wasn't necessary. Then one day I realized how much my daughter LOVED whole friuts vs. the baby-food puree & it was also the first time she choaked on anything... a piece of peach. A few days later I had the safe feeder & its great to let her sit in her highchair and eat on her own. Nice break for me to do paperwork at the same time too, instead of cutting up small pieces for her!! :) Excellent product. Leahs Mommy :)
Great teether!: I bought the Baby Safe Feeder with the intention of putting ice in it for my teething son. My husband had other ideas. He thought it would be a great way to introduce our 5-month-old to grilled steak. It took some convincing, but the voice of reason finally won. We compromised on watermelon, which our son loved! The ice idea works pretty well, too. The only problems I have with the Feeder are it's hard for my son to hold, and its messy. But, he's five months old, what do you expect?! I reccommend this product, but not for steak!
Great Idea!: I tried this based on the recommendation of some moms in my playgroup. Never realized something like this existed! My 7 month old is more difficult than my first two children to take out in public...this helps tremendously when we go to a restaurant. I just get a piece of fruit and it keeps him occupied the whole meal, and I am happy that I am able to give him healthy alternatives! Great, great, great product! (be advised, though, it can take a bit to get baby used to it)
Disappointing: I was swayed by all the positive reviews of this product. I am sure that it works with *some* babies, but unfortunately my daughter is not one of them. She won't put the mesh part in her mouth at all...she keeps turning it the opposite way and chewing on the handle. While the feeder seems like an innovative idea, I think I'm better off either pureeing foods or just waiting to give her certain foods when she is older and less likely to choke.
Mom: The idea of this product is great and that is why I bought it. It has one major problem. To get it clean again is almost impossible. I used it first with a banana and since I could not get all of the banana out of the mesh I ended up tossing it. It came with an extra mesh and I used an apple in that. It met with the same fate.
Love this Item: We love this item. Not only does it allow for my son to feed himself all kinds of foods from frozen milk and frozen veggie cubes to graham crackers and teething biscuits, but it keeps him busy since he can 'do it himself' so that hubby and I can enjoy dinner together and not in shifts. Cleaning it has not been a problem at all...even when I left banana in it OVERNIGHT. (I don't recommend doing that...but if you do...it will come clean). I took the advice of another poster who reviewed this product and clean the feeder with hot water, some vinager and denture cleaning tabs. Works beautifully. We've had our feeder now for about 2 months and use it practically everyday and we're still on our first bag. We LOVE it!
Very handy: This is a great invention! You can stick pieces of whatever food you like in and screw the top on and let your baby discover new foods and cut those new teeth at the same time. It can be difficult to clean, but you can always get new bags. It is also a little bulky but my child didn't have any trouble handling it once he found the tasty treats inside. And, as always with feeding a baby, expect it to be a little messy! I loved mine with my first child and am about to pick one up for my second. You should try one, it's such a relief to know your baby can eat safely without getting too large a chunk of something from those first teeth. You see, it is a mesh bag with a fairly fine mesh, so they have to squish the foods into a pulp and basically suck it through the bag to eat it. A great find.
Great product: I bought this for my 6 month old who is very restless in her highchair. She was very content with this product. The first time I used it with bananas and she loved it. I want to provide healthy food for my baby and this helps me out alot. Not to mention without the worry of a choking hazard. I would have rated this product with 5 stars, but it is a pain in the neck to clean. Food does get stuck in it and takes quite a bit of work to get out. However, I will take the advise of the other comment and buy more bag refills.
This is so awesome!: I discovered this wonderful invention when my son was about 9 months old! I wish I had found it earlier. We froze carrots, bananas, grapes, and peaches and put them in the feeder. He loved them! The frozen food helped soothe his sore gums and he also loved the taste of the food! I highly recommend this for any parent!
Great for Little Eaters!: My 6 months old loves food! I don't buy jarred food, I cook frozen or fresh foods and grind it up for her. This item is awesome. I don't have to grind things up. I can just give her the safe feeder and she sucks it right down. She loves being able to do it herself too. Definetly worth the money 100 times over. You'll be glad you have this!
Daughter does not like: My daughter hates this for some reason. she is teething, so i thought it would be great. I put cantaloupe in it and she licked it and then threw it on the floor and cried when I put it up to her mouth again. We have tried 3x now and she HATES it. I even tried freezing fruit in it and giving it to her that way. I think she hates the feel of the mesh bag. So I just diced the food up like usual and gave it to her that way, even though its messy and she gags on it sometimes. I was disapponited because I thought this would be so nice and avoid all of that hassle and mess but I guess this just won't work out for us.
Messy, hard to clean, and hard to use: While I don't share everyone elses enthusiasm about this product, I will say that my 5 month old 'liked' it. I gave two stars instead of one only for that reason. I can't understand how people are able to clean this thing. I scrubbed it, put it in the dishwasher, used a brissle brush, but it took forever to clean. One thing is for sure, if you buy this, don't use the peel on foods as suggested. I had a little more luck cleaning this when I peeled the grapes (which you'll see isn't really that hard, apples and pears. Bananas I'll never use again, they are virtually impossible to get out of the inside mesh area by the ring. Also, when my baby was done, he was soaked from all the juice and sooo sticky. On the positive, he did seem to have fun at first. Up until the food was small and it kept going up to the top where he couldn't put his mouth around it.Good luck to those who buy this, maybe you'll have better luck like the other reviewers.
My 8 month old wanted nothing to do with it: My 8 month old loves to eat biscuts and toasts, but sometimes I get a little nervous about the possiblility of chocking on little pieces that he bites off. So I thought this would be perfect. I've tried all different kinds of fruit and he wants nothing to do with it. He doesn't get any fruit from the mesh, just fluid. This doesn't teach him how to eat. Sometimes you need to let them take off a chunk and watch what they do with it. Obviously, you need to use your judgement. Also, I thought the ... price tag was a little hefty for a mesh bag and handle, but figured I'd give it a try. Aside from his not liking it, it is impossible to clean. Most likely a ploy to get you to spend more money on replacement bags. Definately not worth the [money]. I'm sorry I bought it. With all the baby stuff out there on the market, it's hard to know what you should buy. This product shouldn't be one of them.
Mesh Feeder: This feeder is great for babies who start sucking on their toys. It is great with cantelope. Buy two and get some replacement bags also.
A little frustrated with this product...: I was SO excited to get this feeder for my 8 month old. I've tried using it several times and he will not put it past his lips! I've tried to 'help' him get started eating from it, but he won't bite! The reason is the mesh bag. He doesn't like the feel of it. He is that way with foods that are not blended smooth enough as well.I would love for him to use it, but I'm not sure what to do! Maybe I will just rely on the food grinder from now on.Great idea though!
UNSAFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: My son is 8 months we have used this item 3 to 4 times since november. He was not really that found of it but I gave it a try since so many highly recommended it and after spending 10$ for it on amazon(shipped)Imagine my supprise when I see a piece of apple next to my kid and ask my mom how he got it out of the feeder.My mom said he was chokeing on apple and shown me the mesh ripped completly from top to bottom like you would cut it with a sharp knife. I will try to add a picture of it ripped.My feeder is ripped and my kid is alive - lucky me I dont have to gamble with my baby life again - and why? to let him suck on a fruit thru a "sock" that is unsafe. You want your baby to eat fruit mash it and feed him please don't experriment.Awful product I dont understand why people write such good reviewes. Just put a piece of fruit in it and try it yourself if you like it -AWFUL!
He didn't "get it": Sorry, but this product was a waste of money. My son hated it. He just "didn't get it". He used it as a toy and threw it on the floor every time I offered it to him. I just gave up! He has been eating fresh fruits and vegetables since he was 9 months old without the use of this unnecessary product. You will have to wean your child off this gadget eventually so why even bother?
Nice concept: My daughter hated this item. She only decided she liked it after she has almost a full mouth of teeth. What a waste. So if you have a finicky child like mine who is sensitive to new tastes and textures, save your money and forget this product.
Effective for a no teether baby: My baby loved this, even though he won't use a single of the many teethers we've tried. This is the only thing that soothes his teething pain that he'll take. We use with frozen apples, even ice cube pieces. Worth the price, as it WORKS
not too bad: I didn't find it too dificult to clean as others commented. It's good for babies over 6 months but one must understand that the baby might throw it away (sometimes very far away) and then all the food is gone. It's a cheap item and the baby might have fun as mine did. When they get a bit older and holding things for longer, it is very handy to leave the baby busy eating some fruit, for example.
Great food item: This feeder is great to let little ones have and make a mess. Don't think they won't get messy. My little one had banana everywhere. She is 9 months and can hold it my herself. However, she does try to eat the bag. She has two teeth that I think could eventually rip the bag if she tries hard enough. But I don't think it is a dangerous feeder. The replacement bags are useful so you can't wash one and put in a fresh one. The screw top is wonderful and it is made in the USA.
Great for babies...: I received this whle I was stilll pregnant I thought it was a joke. To my suprise when my son started solids, I gave him a small piece of peach in this....and he went to town!!!He can eat almost anything from this which he likes since now he can have a taste of whatever mommy and daddy are eating at the time. I feel safe giving him grapes (which I cut in half since the skin is tougher to break in the mesh) and he eats all the pulp out of them and the choking hazard is eliminated! I got the extra 2 nets and when traveling or in a typical day we can use all three and don't worry about washing till the end of the day.My son is now 13 months old and we still use this for the occasional use. It is great for a lot of those fresh fruit days, since he loves to gobble his food down without really trying to chew. I would, and have, reccomend this to every parent.
Love it so much- I buy it for every newborn I know: This is an AMAZING feeder! I have 15 mo old b/g twins and they have loved it since they were 6 months old. I put everything in it- bananas, avocado, apples, pears, cheese, strawberries, watermelon, ice cubes (great for teething), juice cubes, even MEAT! My children love it. Cleaning it was never a problem, I soak the mesh nets in Oxyclean over night and rinse them thoroughly (then I lick it to see if there is ANY residue of the cleaner), then rinse again. They come out perfectly clean. I make sure that I tell them what I am giving them in the feeder so they can learn the words for banana (for example) and that has worked wonderfully too! I love this product
A must have: I just bought this because a friend recommended that I get one for my 8-month-old son. He loves it, in fact I'm going to buy another one to keep in my diaper bag for restaurants, grandma's house, or wherever. We put teething bisquits in it and he goes to town and I don't have to worry about him breaking off a piece and choking on it. I think that this is a must have for all babies!!!!
Caused a rash after each use: A neighbor had recommended this product and it sounded great. I bought it along with extra bags and my baby loves it. We have used it several times and have found two major problems with it. It is really a pain to clean but worse than that - my baby breaks out in a rash around his mouth after each use, despite us washing his face immediately after he is done eating. We have determined that he is allergic to the mesh and won't be using it again. What is it made of anyway?? I threw the packaging out and wish I had kept it.
Very difficult to clean: My son loves it. As soon as I gave it to him with a piece of banana he started chewing on it. But to clean it afterwards is almost impossible. I am trying to find something else.
No more tears: I came across this product with a recommendation from a friend who's twins were having an easy time with teething. My little guy was so unhappy and crying all the time. The bitter biscuits were so messy and even without his first tooth william was able to break them into little chunks. I bought the feeder and used it originaly for his teething. At around 4 months old I was putting melon in it. Although it said to use frozen fruit, I just used fresh and of course fruit juice was everywhere afterward but the crying stopped. The only teething upsets after buying this product were when the tooth actually broke thru, otherwise william was suddenly the happiest kid in town. Melon, strawberrys, oranges, peaches, you name it. and once he was old enough i'd use it at dinner time and give him whatever we were having. Steak and potato....No problem. It made all the difference and saved my sanity to boot. I ran out and bought one for every gal in the family who was having a baby.
Great Product!: I bought this for my son when he was about 6 months old after reading soo many great reviews. I admit, I was very skeptical.. it looked like such a pain to clean! But my son really loves it so it is definately worth the effort it takes to wash. He is teething and I think this is really soothing for those little gums. It is also great for taking along when we eat out as we can always get some fruit from the salad bar, and it keeps him entertained so we can actually eat! The only drawback is the cleaning.. it really does take some effort to get all the food out of it.. especially banana. The feeder has a very thick seam and a ridge around the green part that trap bits of food. I have been using a toothbrush to clean it, but if anyone has some tips to share to make it easier I'd love to hear them!
A parent's best friend....Baby's, too!!: We started using this feeder when my son was just 3 months old. He loved the flavor of melon, but we were uncomfortable with letting him bite on a piece of melon for fear he might choke. The baby feeder was the perfect answer.You can cut up just about anything and place it in the feeder bag. We even put lightly frozen grapes in it when my son was teething. We used it mostly for fruit, especially melon, grapes, pears, and strawberries. I will admit that it can be messy to use this feeder, but it was totally worth it to us to give our son a chance to learn to love fresh fruits. Enjoy!!!!
Baby loves it!: I just recently received this item and my son loves it. He tried it with bananas first and was hooked. He's six months old and I think he loves being able to feed himself at times. I haven't had any trouble keeping it clean so far. I absolutely recommend it.
Too little, too late?: I bought this for my son when he was 8 months old. At that time, he had just started chewing on teething biscuits and I wanted to give him a little more variety in his diet. I think we used it twice before we decided it was too much work. It is a great idea, but takes forever to clean the food out the the bag and my son was fed up with the amount of work he had to put into getting swallow of food. Maybe if we had tried it when he was just being introduced to fruits and veggies this would have worked, but I've decided it was just a huge waste of money for us.
Gives babies an opportunity to try new foods earlier in life: I love this item and we use it almost daily. My daughter's eyes light up when I start filling it, she loves it that much! She has tried many more fresh fruits and vegetables than my other kids did at her age. I even put broccoli in it and she devours it.The only downside is that the net can be difficult to clean when very small food particles are embedded. Sometimes the dishwasher doesn't get it all, so it has to be scrubbed by hand in addition. For that reason, we bought three extra nets. If I haven't had time to clean one, we just grab an extra.Overall, I think this is one of the most useful baby items I've purchased in a while. It beats feeding her nothing but food out of jars.
This is a great product!!: I don't have to worry about my 7 month old daughter choking on teething biscuits (which often break into tiny pieces) when I put them in the baby safe feeder. I feel that it has helped her to learn how to chew and when used with frozen foods helps her with teething.
loved it at first, but now am upset: My sister-in-law bought this for me, and it was a lifesaver! My son stayed quiet while I cooked dinner. However, he's 10 months old, and likes to throw things on the floor. The green top breaks very easily, and my son has just broken the third top. I can't keep buying replacements for it--it's getting too expensive. The idea is excellent, but the product quality stinks, and I'm not buying another replacement, nor am I going to encourage any of my pregnant family or friends to buy it.
GREAT FOR TEETHING BABIES!: I think this is a great idea. I only used it a couple times for foods. At that time she was having trouble mastering how to hold the handle and soon after that she was able to pick up foods on her own and was pretty good at chewing. I LOVE this product for when she is teething. I put a couple ice cubes in it and wet it under the faucet so it doesn't stick to her lips. She gets upset when the ice is gone. My daughter is 11 months and has been teething almost none stop since 3 months...Currently she is cutting her first molars and this helps for her to suck on it and get the cold water back farther than a teething ring would.
GREAT ITEM FOR BABY'S DEVELOPMENT: This is a great item. My 12 m.o. is reluctant to chew and swallow but since I purchased this item, he's eating teething crackers, bananas, little bits of apple. My only complaint is how difficult it is to clean the mesh bag. I've used the toothbrush as suggested by the manufacturer and even put it through the dishwasher and it just doesn't come clean. So, I virtually use a new bag with every item the baby eats. But all in all, well worth it.
LOVE IT - but would have thrown it out if i hadn't read the review with the cleaning tip...: BUY THIS!it is great!but - i would have thrown it out the window after the first time we used it (bananas!) had i not read the customer review that instructed how to clean it. it gets really messy and hard to clean UNLESS you follow the tip and soak it in oxyclean detergent and melt away all the goop. *just don't forget to rinse rinse rinse off all the detergent residue!!!!*it is a great invention - been using it for many months with my now 11 month old son - favorites are mango, watermelon, grapes...he had some steak tips last week! it is a wonderful thing - just make sure you follow the cleaning tip and you'll love it!
The best baby item I've bought!: To all the people who have rated this product a low score: "WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?". My daughter is 8.5 months old, and nearly choked on a cheerio. She would also bite pieces of teething biscuits off, and almost choked on those too. For those of you complaining about cleaning banana...it says right on the instructions that they don't recommend putting banana in it for that exact reason. It's awesome for teething biscuits and apple slices, as well as frozen juice for those really bad teething days. This beats any other baby item I've bought, and will be giving this as gifts to every new mom I know!
Doesn't Teach Baby to Eat Safely!: Unless your child has a feeding issue that prevents thenm from eating solids this is a waste of money. My son started to eat solids that were not pured before he even had teeth, ask your pediatrician, they can tell you that until your child has molars that chew with their gums. First he started with cheerios, they will melt in your babies mouth, and yes he did gaga little, but a nurse told me that is normal and part of the process of learnign to eat. When he mastered that I introduced other foods. To make it safe I just cut his food up into tiny pieces (about the size of a cheerio). He only has 4 teeth now at 12 monthes old but he eats what we eat, just cut up (the pieces can be larger now).
ICK!: This product looked GREAT online and I thought it would be the perfect way to allow my young son to feed himself independently some of the time. He wanted NOTHING to do with it. Really, would YOU want to eat your food through a piece of mesh? I didn't think so.
i hope i didnt waste my money: i believe this is a good product but its not suitable for my 14 month old daughter. she screams when i show it to her and wants all her fruits in hand to chew on her own. she has 4 teeth up top and 2 on bottom. since she was younger, she has been excellent about not swallowing what she knows wont fit down her throat. i plan to use the feeder with my next baby due in 2 weeks as soon as he is ready to use it and hope he favors it.
Possible Choking hazard?: I have a hard time believing that the baby would not choke on this. They are putting the mesh bag in their mouths and they could get that mesh bag back far enough to choke themselves. They do not have the knowledge yet to know to pull it out. Not sold on these!!!!
Totally Useless: This product seemed like it would be such a great thing, but my daughter would have nothing to do with it. It's way too hard for babies to actually get any food through the mesh-- the holes are too small. It ended up as just one more gunky mess for me to clean up.
Will melt if slips through top rack of dishwasher: I never used this with my son because when I attempted to wash it before use, it slipped through the top rack of the dishwasher (the recommended washing spot) and the plastic then melted. Be very careful if you clean this in the dishwasher!
Love this product!!: I really love this product. My son is teething and I cut bananas into chunks and freeze them, then place them in the feeder. He goes ballistic! And it feels good on his gums too!I've given him watermelon, cantelope, all kinds of fruit in it. Definitely worth the money. My only reservation is cleaning. It's a little hard to get spic and span, even with the dishwasher, but it's worth the extra effort too!
Great idea, but...: This product is a really good idea, but be warned that it's difficult to clean. Bits of food get trapped in the seams of the mesh bag and near the plastic ring. I scrub using a short-bristle brush as recommended, soak and rinse under hot water repeatedly and still can't get it completely clean. Stains are one thing, but pieces of food will grow bacteria. I worry how safe that is to give to a baby. If the manufacturer can fix the problem, this would be a must-have product.
My baby refuses it!: I don't really know if this thing works or not because my 8 mo old refuses to have anything to do with it. Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth, will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething. It seems like a great idea for that short transition period between mush & solids. This particular one appealed to me because it's not dyed & it's made in the USA. As to whether or not it works? I will never know!
Baby broke cap on second use: The feeder works fine, though the netting does get nasty from banana and is really hard to get clean after baby eats banana in it.However, my baby broke the green part of the cap just by dropping the feeder on the wood floor - the SECOND time she used it.It has a crack in it now that has a sharp edge, so it is no longer safe for her to use. The design was fine but turned out not to be worth my $5.
Mesh fell apart after a month: It was okay while it lasted but then the mesh started unraveling at the seams. I like the concept of this but in practical use, my 7.5 month old wasn't thrilled about using this. The handle is a bit heavy and I wondered why they couldn't make it a little lighter to hold. My baby ends up holding onto the mesh part of this b/c the handle is too heavy for her. Eating out of this does get really messy but that's going to happen any time babies try to feed themselves. In comparison to the Munchkin Feeder I bought, this is nice in that the handle screw off but the Munchkin feeder is much more durable and the mesh is easier to clean.
Happy Baby = Happy Mom: This is one of the best baby products ever! My 9 month old daughter is very high needs and this is the only thing that will keep her occupied for more than 30 minutes. It not only gives her healthy, fresh snacks to eat but it gives me much needed free time to do things like cook dinner. I wish I would have purchased this for my now 4 year old son when he was small. He nearly choked to death on a meat stick. I plan on buying more to always have a clean one on hand.
Gastric Memoir: Think of this short piece more as a culinary review than a work of philosophy or fiction or even memoir. Baudelaire speaks to the pros and cons of both Wine and Hashish as well as the impact of both on the body. In addition, he dabbles in satire and social insight, giving the reader a wonderful view of his life, opinions and experiences.
Classic: This is Baud writing about his experiences with Hashish and Wine. It is very poetic and very enjoyable with lots of memorable quotes.Oh Great Hashish!
Godzilla hearts Scorpio!: Godzilla makes friends with a giant scorpion! That is one of the wackiest notions I've ever heard about Godzilla. Still, one wonders if there friendship can last? Find out in this monster romp!
This book does an excellent job of portraying Godzilla.: "Godzilla Invades America" is a neat represantation of the Godzilla universe. This is the first Random House Godzilla novel to feature other monsters. Scott Ciencin writes the Kamarucas (Gimantis) and Kumonga (Spegia) monsters very closely to their movie incarnations. An interesting occurence in the book has Kamaracuras carrying Kumonga as they fly away to escape their battles with Godzilla and the giant scorpion. This is strange because in "Son of Godzilla", Kumonga tries to paralyze and eat Kamaracuras. Another intriguing point in this book is Godzilla making friends with the giant scorpion. In "Godzilla King of the Monsters", the book, Godzilla dreams about himself playing with his Godzillasuarus friends. Obviously, he still wishes to play because after a small battle, the two quickly become pals. This book is worth reading because it has a lot of great moments in it when Godzilla fights his monster foes.
Flavorless Funk: I have thousands of funk albums. This one is boring-- with a few exceptions, the more "obscure" tracks follow the formula without any inspiration (I 'm waiting to see, but imagine the first 2 in this series will be a little better?) Ho Humm/off to bed....
Think twice before buying!: I bought this CD on the recommendation of the reviews here on Amazon.com. But I regret the purchase. I buy CD's both to teach my kids new songs and to keep them quiet in the car. We have all of these songs on several different albums, so the songs on this album, "classic" they may be, were not interesting enough to grab the attention of my kids--two and four. The "young artists" in this album do not have the clearest articulation, so I do not know how much a child can learn from this album, if he/she does not know the songs already. Sure it is cute to hear little kids sing, but I suggest one thinks carefully before making this purchase.
elmer fudd kids who think they're cute: I was highly disappointed by this cd. I had also read the reviews and thought this might be fun for my 2 year old son. First of all the kids all sound like they've had speech lessons from Elmer Fudd. Second, the recording is striving for `cutesy wutsey' and comes off as quite nauseating. I like the sound of children's voices, so don't get me wrong on this point. Smithsonian series has some great songs with kids singing and it is quite enjoyable. The kids on this cd however, are so self-conciously trying to be cute that it comes off as annoying, especially the old man is snoring song. Be warned. There are much better and fun cds out there choo choo bugaloo and the above mentioned Smithsonians cd series as well as satchmo sings disney etc. avoid this one unless you are a lover of sacharine cutesy wutsey poorly produced garbage. my kid doesn't like it either. he is bored with it. and god knows I don't want him@speaking like these kids. uggggh
don't like it at all!: I am very disappointed with this CD considering it was recommended by the parents. I bought it for my 2 years old daughter and she is not even interested in listening to it. She likes her other CDs a lot better. I can't stand listening to it because it just sounds too annoying. What a waste of money!
No more fussy car rides: A friend gave this CD to my 11 month old daughter. Every time we put it on in the car, she stops fussing and starts smiling. We never hear a peep from her after that. While it is cutesy, my husband and I much prefer to hear these young toddler voices rather than professional sounding 10-11 year olds on other CD's. She knows all the songs now and loves to listen to us sing them to her during bath or changing time. The fussing stops there, too.
I love this cd: The Toddlers Sing cds are the best cds for toddlers that I have found. I have been a music teacher for twenty years and have used more cds than I can count in my classrooms. These are the best by far. I think the toddlers, preschoolers, and kindergarteners like them so much because the kids on the cds sound just like them. The songs are great and easy to sing. It is such a simple concept with amazing results - sheer happiness and enjoyment. My three year old daughter is their biggest fan. We actually listened to this cd so much in the car that it cracked in the cd player. Had to get a new cd player, but the biggest loss was of the cd. Needless to say, we purchased another as soon as we knew it was broken. We love these kids and their songs.
Young toddlers love it: I am purchasing this CD for my 2 year old because I remember how much my 14 year old son enjoyed it as a toddler. The reason children like this CD is that they love hearing other kids sing. Although there have been exceptions (my oldest liked Raffi-especially the Christmas CD) my kids preferred hearing little ones. And, even though some parents complain about how syrupy sweet it is, isn't it worse as an adult having to listen to grown ups sing silly songs? Who wants to hear a 30 year old woman singing about a teapot anyway???
A great CD for the little ones!: My two grandchildren (ages 2 1/2 and 8 months) love the songs on this CD. They've enjoyed the CD so much that I've purchased additional CDs for all their little cousins.
Very Annoying: I found this cd, and the toddlers sing rock cd, highly annoying. My daughter was not very enthusiastic about it either since it lacks the musicality she is used to in her other cds.
Toddlers Sing: I purchased this tape on the reviews of others, but was very disappointed. While the children are cute, their english is horrible. I never play this tape for my son, as I do not want to expose him to the "baby talk" and incorrect pronunciation.
Terrible waste of money!: Before I purchased this book, I read the description which stated "This book may have occasional imperfections such as missing or blurred pages, poor pictures" etc. What I got was a book where MOST pages were too light to read. The entire book is like a copy of a copy of a copy. Plus, the actual title of the book is "Winfield Courier History of Cowley County Kansas" which makes the book (at least what I have been able to read) heavily about Winfield, Kansas, not the entire county. A big dissapointment.
Don't buy this Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story line sound really good, but it was stupid and boring!!! Don't waste your money on For Queen and Country.
extremely educational: My 2 1/2 yr old daughter loves these puzzles. The backs of the puzzles have a color along with the name of the animal that is on the front. This allows us to either put together a 'zebra' or flip one over and put together the colored puzzle with the word on it. Obviously you need to keep these away from the 13-month old, b/c they are not intended for chewing. This toy is best used when brought out under adult supervision to ensure pieces are not rough handled b/c they are made out of cardboard. However, my toddler cherishes the time we spend and cheers when she seems me pulling out the box b/c its mommy time and matching/education time as well.
Not what I expected: I returned mine. The ring is very large...taking up the entire length of my finger between my middle and end knuckle. Some people can carry this look off but it is not a good look for a smallish person like me. Also, the "stone" part looks like enamel rather than the cool, unique stone that I thought it was going to look like. The color is beautiful but is lacks the depth and variety that would make it look like a true natural stone.
Totally Awesome!!!!! Jump-starts the soul.: This is one the best CD's I have listened to, for the spirit, in a long time. It really gets you jumping and helps to lift the spirits...listen to the words and it is really uplifting....from Elton John's "I'm Still Standing " to Paul Anka"s "My Way". I feel like I could conquer anything that comes my way.

nice little toy...but Beware: Bought this on a whim but read on how it a waste of $12.00+ The led lights are very cheap and very dim, you are better off buyingUSB LED Light for Laptop and PC Computer, Electronics & Computerswhich is cheaper and more effective. The body is very plasticky. The worst of it is the seller charged me $18.00 to ship a $12.00 item. Normally an item this size and weight should only cost about $4-$5 at most to ship to my location. So yes, definitely feel ripped off. About the only good thing I can say is the fan blades are made of soft material, so you don't have to worry about cutting your fingers by mistake. Save your money and get something else of better value.For everyone avoid this item, for me I'm avoiding this seller.
FOR REAL HIP-HIP HEADS... No commercial pricks: After hearing Talib Kweli and Hi-Tek's "Reflection Eternal", I had to find some more material from Hi-Tek. Hi-Teknology is full of amazing, unique, and original production. The album also has some great underground emcees. The short solo productions of Hi-Tek, without the raps, "Scratch Rappin" and "Tony Guitar Watson" are just amazing! I guarantee satisfaction. All the cuts are unique and individually amazing. GET THIS ALBUM!! DON'T SLEEP ON IT.
Lo-Tek: Hi-Tek has never been a personal favorite of mine, but I did enjoy his work on Blackstar and with Mos Def. He's just not the type of producer who puts out the bangin' hip hop beats I prefer. Hi-Teknology only proves this further. The majority of the beats featured are weak, dull, soft, whatever you want to call them. Not to say I want everything to be Rasco-esque, but I get bored of those Common-type beats that don't make your head nod even a little bit. I'm starting to get the impression that Hi-Tek is a one trick pony who is saving all of his better beats for future projects. Hi-Teknology comes off as being very incomplete.
Cats are sleep on this Natti producer: I recommend this album for two words "Hi" and "Tek"! This cat is as real as it comes. He has an all-star(that's if you on the "real" hip-hop scene) lineup along with his tight, and signature beats. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the CD wasn't long enough for me. I guess I'm greedy. But on the really real you gotta feel Tek, if not, you'z a hater, dats real. But to really feel him, I mean really, you gotta get Train of Thought, Quality, Black Star, and The Beautiful Struggle. Hi-Tek defines real hip-hop, just like the old Hulk Hogan represents real wrestling. Now get back at your boy about that!
can you say oh my!: this album...no need to skip thru the tracks...all of it is sick....sun god w/common, keep tha steppin w/mos def & vinia mojica..slum village, kweli & others. hi-teknology is a cd that i can listen to over & over again! this is a must have if you like GOOD HIPHOP MUSIC!
Hi Tek ! DA Da DA Da DA! Da! DADa! DA! DA! Hi Tek!: Not since Bootsy Collins and his brother joined James Brown's band in 1970 has Cincinatti's funk had such a high platform. Hi Tek makes a sweet blend of smooth lady vocals, hard bass thumps and sweet old school hornplay thats consistent on every song he produces. Suddenly with underground stunners Mood, the Cormega track, and the Buckshot joint are the heaviest pavement pounders. Get this album and turn the volume to high proportions.
Hi-teknological, neurological, unstoppable: Hi tek is one of the best producers/djs out there, and he shows off his skills in his new album by working with a wide variety of artists with different tastes and abilities. It had a slower feel to it, and Hi tek is never one to use a "form beat" to create the normal rap/pop song. The lyrics are moving, and exactly what you would expect from greats kweli, mos def, and common. If you are looking to download, pick up sun god, get back part II get to steppin, and LTAH which has a feel of something you do not hear often. Overall, Hi tek put out a great album of slower and more experimental beats that show off his production prowess. This is a good cd to add to an underground collection.
dissapointed: i was thinkn this new album would be ill, but i was disapointed. The tune ws off the hook, but the artists werent as good as i thought. He got some good, like common, talib kweli, mos def, not much else. I was thinkn hed get all the good rappas. i dont have much to say, i like the beats and all, but the artists were not as good. Hi tek still a good dj, but he just had some bad judgement on the rappn.
Still the best book on the end times: This is a very thorough study of the end times. The first part of the book is a defense of the grammatical-historical interpretation of Bible prophecy. Then Pentecost dives right in with a survey of the four major biblical covenants, and a study of Israel in prophecy, the Gentiles in prophecy, and the church in prophecy. He includes a detailed discussion of the timing of the rapture, the events of the seven year tribulation period, and the second coming of Christ, followed by the 1000 year Millennial reign of Christ. He then has a helpful section about the eternal state.It must be stated that this is a 600 page heavy duty textbook. It is not like reading a Frank Peretti novel or a Left Behind book. This is for the hard core Bible prophecy student, and it is still THE end times book to get. Pray that someone will wake up and revise it for the 21st century and include chapters critiquing the prewrath rapture view and the preterist view.
Things to Come--but still the same book: The point of this review is that any version of Things to Come, at least from 1958 to 1980, the version in front of me, is the same text reprinted.Hey, you wouldn't be looking for "Things to Come" if you didn't like it. This is 633 detailed pages discussing Biblical prophecy by topic and in detail from those positions which J Dwight Pentecost has come to represent. Yes, this was his doctoral research when he was just starting out, turned into a book and still selling more than 50 years later (as he is also still teaching, as I write!)
The limit of my ability to read!: I bought THINGS TO COME a long time ago. I may still have it. For me the poor layman it surpasses my ability to endure. I read 110 pages of it and quit! I did learn that my style of Bible interpretation was the literal-historical interpretation. While people like Benny Hinn, who I have observed trying to teach the Bible is allegorical. I used one chapter which identifies the players in Ezekiel 38 and 39. Eveyone's books just say that Russia will invade Israel. But I remember him call "Gomer" there Germany. So, I just described Ezekiel 38 based on that book chapter as the nations of the world invading Israel to go to war with Jesus Christ in armageddon-Russia, the Germans and EU and the Arabs. I remember some complicated teachings about God's covneants with Isreal and Abraham. Too much for me. I just used it as sort of a reference book to look some things up in. My fomer P Chem prof, Dr. Thompson actually looks like Dwight Pentecost-how amusing!
Makes a Nice Door Stop!: If you need a new door stop OR a class Dispensational reference guide to eschatology, then Pentecost will do the job.If you are looking for eschatology that's faithful to the history of redemption, better to look elsewhere.Ironically, there's more good eschatology in Acts via the *real* Pentecost than J.D. Pentecost's understanding of Acts!!
no plastic taste, thank goodness: All I have to say is that for those of you looking to get rid of that plastic taste... this is the answer. I have a Camelbak hydration pack. No matter what I did I couldn't get rid of that plastic taste, and I tried a lot of things. I tried all of the suggestions on Camelbak's website, as well as the suggestions of others with the same complaint. In the process, I learned that Platypus is made of a different type of plastic... either the whole thing, the inside lining, or the tube alone. I don't know, but it solved the problem. Now water tastes like refreshing water.
dry and disappointing: This is largely disappointing, if only because the bulk of the writing is extremely dry and poorly constructed. As an English major I may be an elitist, but I expect professors to be able to write at least as well as I do. One notable exception to an otherwise bland collection is Suszanne McCorkle's "American Hero Meets Terrorist," an essay that tries hard to introduce relevance to a volume that's otherwise mired in the 1980s.
Not worth it!!! - FULL TEXTS NOT INCLUDED: The information on this CD is far too small. All you are able to do is search for citations of a literary work such as date published, original publication, author, original title. THIS CD DOES NOT HAVE THE FULL TEXTS OF ANY WORK. You would be better off googling a literary or buy a brand name encyclopedia suite than get this. I was pretty naive about what it included. DON'T BUY IT. It's not work the shipping.
Great story for interactive reading with children: A good introduction for the story of Noah and the Ark, easy to understand, and with the hand signs and movements, you can capture the children's attention and get them involved.
Fun way to tell a great story from the Bible: This title, part of the Action Rhyme Series from New Day Publishing, gives parents, RE teachers, and Christian daycare providers a fun and nicely illustrated text for teaching the story of Noah and the Ark. Each 16 page book in the series is a treat, and with the actions suggested, each is a nice solution to the "wiggles" that often affect 3-6 year olds.
Very solid!: I was looking for a sturdy shovel, and I always look for Made in USA. This fits the bill on both counts. It's built like a tank.I checked every local hardware store, and not a decent shovel to be found. Eleven varieties of Ames True Temper, a few off brands, a few store brands. A few had decent handles, but every single one without exception had soft, thin, cheap imported steel (in a few cases "tempered in USA") guaranteed to bend or break under any strenuous work.Where I come from, the ground is filled with rocks. A shovel takes a beating digging even a modest hole. You have to be able to stand on the foot braces and jump up and down, and scrape and auger and pound. Cheap junk won't cut it.This Bully Tools shovel has as solid construction as I have ever seen in a shovel. Pound on the blade, and it gives that distinctive deep thud you'd associate with a whack from a cast iron pan. Very nice. Heartily recommended.
BSA: (...) He blames BSA for the demise of his true love, Triumph. Basically he would be quite happy if BSA had not made anything more sophisticated than the A10. Save your money and buy a decent book on BSAs!!!!!
save your money: This was a total waste of money! The male terminal does not fit properly into the ingition side of the harness and good luck with the instructions on installation. There is plenty of room on the factory harness to connect the wires with no problems.The vendor was very prompt and I had no issues with thier service, I would buy from them again.
Very cute, but runs small: I love this teddy -- it has a slimming effect and seems like a quality product. I found it for $13 elsewhere on this site, but it was a small/medium, and it fit tight. I think this is a one size fits all product -- not for women over 5' 5". Very sexy, with no back except for a pair of strings to hold it together.
does not work: Put it all together and it does not work. The directions are horrible to follow and they should give you an option to purchase it assembled.
Not what I ordered: I ordered these bags because I can no longer get this brand locally. Instead of receiving the feeder bags listed above, I received the Sassy brand---which I do not like because they do not fit my feeder. I am so frustrated as I have a teething toddler who is in miserable pain and only enjoys crushed ice in her mesh feeder!!!
Not what we ordered: I too received the Sassy brand, rather than what is pictured and advertised, as I was moving too fast to read the feedback. One star (ideally, less). This MUST be remedied.
Do not fit babysafe feeder!: These did not fit the original Babysafe Feeders unlike the misleading item title and description. They are the Sassy brand. They are too small and do not fit. Very disappointed!
Too small: Theses replacement bags are too small for Sassy teething feeder. They don't match at all. Can't use them on feeder.
Does not fit baby safe feeder!: This product is advertised as refills for the Baby Safe Feeder but they are too big. Waste of money. I had to order the original replacement bags from the Baby Safe website. Don't waste your money!
Not for the original green Baby Safe Feeder (TM): My husband ordered this product thinking it would work with the original Baby Safe Feeder(TM) as the second picture indicates and stated in the product title but it does not. The only way you can get replacement bags for the "green" feeder (only one made in the USA) is by going to (...). These replacement bags are for the Sassy Teething Feeder. Amazon and the seller has been contacted to correct this misrepresentation and misuse of a trademark.
These DO NOT fit the green babysafe feeder!: I received Sassy brand mesh bags, which are too large to fit in the green baby safe feeder shown in the photo (they also do not fit the Nuby feeder, which I also have). If you have a Sassy feeder, then great. If not, don't waste your money.
not a fan: I bought these and the feeder at the sametime. My daughter hated it! Cleaning bananas out of these are impossible. If you REALLY want these, go to Babies-R-US....I think they are cheaper. But save your money!!
Definite Must Have: As any parent knows teaching a baby to eat can be a steep, uphill battle. After 3 months of trying and a fair share of gagging I decided to try this feeder. Hallelujah! Although our son may not like the taste of food, given the smirk on his face, he will eat using the Baby Safe Feeder. This product gave us one of our first meals where he has eaten without gagging or giving us a fight. The other brands may be a little cheaper but this product is made, assembled and packaged in the USA. Don't believe however that this won't be messy. Our little guy likes to bang and squeeze this mesh bag as much as he likes to suck and chew on it. Buying extra bags and feeders are recommended in case it is dropped.
great for teething babies!: this is a GREAT thing to have around when your baby is teething! Put ice in the bag, and although your baby's shirt or bib may get pretty wet, the COLD of the ice really numbs their gums and brings back the smile!
Changed formula is sickening sweet: I have been buying this brand of sugar-free DGL for a long time. I am extremely disappointed that they have recently changed the formula so that these tablets are now sickening sweet and leave an aftertaste similar to that of regular table sugar. To be clear, the principal ingredient, deglycyrrhizinated licorice, is the same. But they have added sorbitol, anise seed powder, and stearic acid to "other ingredients." It is sorbitol, a sugar alcohol, that adds the hypersweet taste. I'm looking for another brand and am returning this order.
No longer same product: DO NOT BUY THIS !!! - They changed the product. It is no longer licorice. It is only anise powder with an artificial sweetener now.
USEFUL BUT NOT PERFECT: This book has been written in a completely different and useful methode,therefore you can find an extremely useful charts and explanations and exercises, but the problem is that it does not have the answer key so you can not use it as an independent material. I suggest that an answer key to be included in the next edition.
Good: It has been great source for advanced learners, however it doesn't give adequate details about a particular subject. one thing which come to mind is that it does this because it is for advanced learners, therefore, a person must have some knowledge about the regarding subject. In general, it is worthwhile to have.
toefl.grammer , writing and speaking: my name Ahmed Askar abdi.Iam writing befor one massage ,so i want one book of english.so i have receaving your massage and thank. but i want tu seny me as soon as posible.next book you have tell me.excuse me my poor english
Be Patient.: When I watched the first episode, I thought it was revolting at face-value, and a little too violent nothing like G1. As a manual describes "more human" than mechinanized characteristics. In retrospect it has the premise of Dragonballz, they have similar qualities.i.e. The Saiyans and Frieza...Transform. Allow the story to unfold one episode after another and you will see how hot it gets. Possibly the hottest of all The Transformers epics. Masterforce has good moments of heroism.Produced by Wok. Followed byTransformers Victory 1-32 End (4 DVD Disc).
Not Just For English as Second Language: This book is awesome and I think that adults and kids will love it. Like the the reviewer before me, this book would be enjoyed by English as a second language people - and, I'd add everyone!!This story is FUNNY and well written.
Breaks easily: DO NOT BUY! This case breaks very easily. There really isnt much more to say. It is very hard to get to anything on the sides and the belt clip broke off on mine within 2 days of purchase.
Do not purchase this item: I purchased two of these items from eforcity. One was clear and one was smoke for our new LG VX8500 phones. The smoke case was slightly warped and would not even fit on the phone. The clear case was attached to my wifes phone and severely interfered with the slide action of the phone. It broke after one day and came off of the phone. The product is made from very thin, cheap plastic.
Horrible display, minimal contrast, large and clunky.: The display on this device is really hard to read, and the contrast is poor. The box is quite large compared to the display itself, it feels like technology from 1992. I can't recommend it. Hard to imagine the other products in this category are worse.
Don't do it...: After applying these strips just ONCE...I have very splotchy inconsistent white sports that looks horrible. Those splotchy marks are VERY white while the rest was hardly changed. Have a dentist whiten your teeth to do it right. My teeth look really wierd now...
Sorry, Easier isnt better...: ...I didn't have to tell you that though. They don't work at all, maybe one shade of whitening if you are lucky. I use whitestrips frequently to maintain white teeth. I decided to try this, no results. I am using whitestrips premium as I type this to make up for the no whitening. Oh well, they have a satisfaction guarentee, just keep[ the invoice!
BDA STRIPS: Any person that give good review about this product must be working for the company a $20.00 plus tax this product is completly useless it breaks when you try to remove it from is glue place its rolls up making it impossible to used any any other stripos is a lot better than this garbage I 'm offended to give it one star it should ZERO STAR.Once again don't waste your money on REMBRANDT STRIPS it DISSOLVE IN YOUR HANDS.

Now in paperback, this Rockport Publishers offering covers all aspects of identity design clearly and specifically. From "The Ten Rules" to "Implementing Logos," the authors provide a visual smorgasbord of case studies and examples from firms such as Landor Associates, Morla Design, Pentagram, and over 45 other studios of all sizes, in explaining the basics and the idiosynchrocies of the logo design process. This book should be required reading for the students of any educational institution as they begin to study the creation of identities. - Jeff Fisher, Logo Notions/CreativeLatitude and bLog-oMotives
Amateur Video: There is some useful information here, but this video makes most youtube videos look like cinematic masterpieces. I would recommend skipping this item.
If you thought you knew it all about "the" case.....: Dear Readers:This book reveals fascinating new information that only came to light during the civil trial. The writing is expert and the information is presented in a way that rekindled my quest to know everything about this tragic event. I have read thirty (or so) books about the trial and this one ranks among the very best. It's not over until you have read this book. Dan Petrocelli is a true hero.
The Freshest and Most Complete picture of the entire saga!!!: This book captures you from the first page. Just when you think nothing new can be brought to this tragedy which has enveloped the nation, we finally have the truth....not bogged down in the issues which have clouded every other story.Mr Petrocelli has spoken the words that were in my heart....and truths I *felt* all along. Thank you, sir, for restoring my faith in the Justice system. Wish it all (justice system)would operate by the standards we see here. I would encourage anyone to pick up and read this book.
A 636 page ego trip!: As both a trial attorney and "court" buff, I really enjoyed the factual basis of the book, and much of the accounts of the Simpson deposition and testimony were riviting, HOWEVER, when we hear about the genius, and yes heroic bravery of attorney Pettrocelli it goes so far off the deep end that it threatens to make the entire book perhaps best left on the shelf. The Best (worst) example of this was when he describes giving O.J. the chance to "lay his hands" on him while testifying. He goes to great lengths to to say that even though he is smaller then O.J. that he "wasn't afraid". As if O.J. was going to pull out a knife and kill him in a room full of lawyers! The value of this book lies not in the shameless self-promotion of the author but rather in explaining that both the criminal and civil juries in this case may well have come to the correct conclusion, and in explaining how the differences in the system can lead to this conclusion.
Accept it world, OJ was innocent!: I followed this case very closely and I believe that the verdict was completely fair. No other verdict was possible. OJ was innocent! The notion that many people hold that public opinion polls "proved" he was guilty is ridiculous. He was either guilty or he wasn't. I have never had a conversation with anyone regarding this case - no matter how sure they were initially of OJ's guilt --who didn't come away with the opinion that there was a lot more to the case than they had previously thought and that perhaps OJ wasn't guilty after all. The fact that OJ is currently imprisoned in Nevada on "kidnapping" charges makes me lose a great deal of respect for our judicial system.
this bpok is excelllent: i read it every night as i believe too in my heA6T THAT OJ IS GUILTY I CHEERED WHEN I SAW THE CIVIL VERG IT READ OUT ON TV AND READING THIS BOOK TELLS ME WHY THEY GOT THEY VERDIT DOES DAN HAVE A E MAIL ADRESS I LOVE TO WRITE TO HIM HE A GOOD WRITER
Boring and incompetent writing: Petrocelli (and/or his ghost writer) have put together a book that is replete with incorrect use of the language in terms of tenses and punctuation marks, and the writing style is without any real sense of flow. I found this effort tedious and poorly organized, certainly not worthy of an attorney of his stature -- unless it was written soley for the money that nearly any book about O.J. Simpson can produce.
Terrible book: Humanity has declined to such a point where they are just useless idiots that stare at shadows in the walls. Apes work on fields to feed the humans. In the mean time our computers bravely explore the galaxy and every now and then they check on humans and they break a few rules. There is also some kind of impossible love affair on this book. This is a completely disjointed, incoherent, depressing book.
Very (poor): This is one of the worst books that I have ever read. It is fairly depressing, first humans are taken over by their own computers and then they become extinct.
A good read, if a little tough to identify with at times: When I read this book I immediately thought of Olaf Stapledon's book "Last and First Men." Both books are very well written, explore some very interesting ideas, and cover such a wide swathe of time that you really have no individual characters to identify with. They are almost closer to history books than they are to science fiction novels (merely an observation, not a criticism).Having said that, "Genesis" does maintain some characters throughout the book, and somehow this makes it easier on the reader when Poul Anderson starts to really push and question what it means to be human, both mentally and biologically (if you can make that distinction).This is not a light summer read. It is good solid science fiction that pushes the reader outside of his or her comfort zone and into a world where "human" is not a clear-cut concept, but is more a question of perspective.
A Disgrace: Poul Anderson ought to be ashamed of himself. He took the worked-to-death theme of sentient machines, presented the same dead-tired ideas in a grandious backdrop - I suppose that was an attempt to make his readers think he said something new - integarated them loosely with some old short stories of his and called it a "new" book. What little story the book has lurches along until Anderson apparently got tired of writing and quit. It certainly had no ending in the normal sense of a novel. At times, Anderson's prose is almost poetry. It flows beautifully. Unfortunately, when examined for meaning, it's often complete nonsense. Add the fact that the only two characcters in the book are two dimensional strawmen that Anderson made no effort whatsoever to flesh out and what you get is a real stinker. The only interesting aspect is whether Anderson is a cynical old man trading on his reputation to grub some easy money or whether he's really that far over the hill.
Yes, a Great Book: I can confirm the previous positive reviews of this book. US foreign policy is exposed in detail in this work. These were crucial years (1944-1954) in twentieth century Guatemala, and the US played a decisive and destructive role. After the US intervention, Guatemala experienced a long series of brutal dictatorships backed by the US, which culminated in civil war in the 1970s and 1980s. Any student of Latin America or US foreign policy would greatly benefit by reading Gleijeses's book.
Would not recommend: Although the novel covers some interesting aspects, it fails to captivate its audience. Its barbaric and at times childish remarks fall short of what a good author should provide for his readers.AVOID THIS BOOK.
Beauty: This is really an extraordinary, beautiful novel. It is not for everyone--it's too smart to be, too strange and strangely wise. I bought this book and half expected it to be some pale shadow of Homer and found instead a whole world, hilarious, sad, absurd. Did I mention beautiful?
An enigma, poetry, and the odyssey rolled into one.: I've been wanting to read this novel since I read a short story by Ehrenreich in McSweeneys about an odd couple meeting in an aquarium in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Although it's far from my idea of the perfect novel and I can see how it might be construed as pretentious, I think Ehrenreich has a very unique, and poetic voice. I love the way this book and the short story I read seem to teeter somewhere between a surreal nightmare, a daydream, and everyday reality. It's not for everyone, but if you are looking for something different and you appreciate the craft of writing, it might be just right for you!
Fantastic Book: I've read a lot of books in the line of city/street type fiction and Dexter has it down cold on the likes of Richard Price and even Pellecanos. It's a very lived in book and a very funny book and every single character is eerily believable. I can't understand why this book doesn't have more reviews. Hopefully readers just assume it speaks for itself, since it's as close as you can come to a classic. Wish he'd left the newspaper guy out though. The book is stronger than rockets without him.
Tom Leinenweber: God's Pocket is a tremendous book. A great look at an insular society and an outsider's mistake in trying to understand it.
COULDN'T GET INTO THIS: This book was allright in the beginning but some parts were boring. It was okay but it was worth 2.5 stars. The story was sad but moving but it fell apart later.
Disappointed: The book had only one baby design that I liked, the rest were pillows, very basic accessories and boring designs for older kids, not even toddlers the same pictures of the same projects repeated thoughout the book. Colorful and well phographed, but no very inspiring.
Uggh...: I bought this book earlier from a bookstore. I'm glad I did because returning it was very easy.... I have read more interesting grafitti in bathroom stalls.
Perfect Gift: My grandson loves books by Sir Walter Scott. I ordered this one to add to his collection. It was inexpensive but beautifully bound. I am pleased and so was my grandson!
Okay...: This was an okay book. While I did believe that the book had great potential, Rob Roy fell short of my expectations.
Good @ Deep!: Rob Roy is a great book, but I caution! This book is very deep, I repeat, VERY DEEP! The Scottish dialect is very hard to understand. But the characters are amazing! The plot is great, but remember everything! Sort'av.
Boring and confusing: I have derived many hours of pleasure from this author. My favorite is Ivanhoe. I wouldn't recommend this one, though. It is boring and confusing.
Incredible new artist I'll look forward to hearing more from: I've been waiting a long time for music like this. It's "always in my head" and I love it.
Long awaited new CD was worth the wait.: India Arie delivers more upbeat, positive and spiritually uplifting beats in her own unique sounds. She's not afraid to be herself and be different from the top tunes of today.
Too Brilliant for the Grammy Voters...!: If one needs further proof that the Grammy Awards reward artists who adhere to convention, we see India Arie shut out in favor of the video-friendly, incredibly overrated beauty Alicia Keys. I guess they can understand the simplistic "teenager-in-love" noodlings of our Ms. Keys more than the wry, ironic, world-wise songs India offers. Or is it the difference between Alicia's piano-based music (does that make it "classy" somehow? Besides, she's not THAT great a pianist) and India's guitar-based soul?I defy anyone who loves soul music to listen to this CD and not fall in love with her smoky voice. I melted the first time I heard her. This is a stunning set from a powerful talent, and she will be with us for a very, very long time, I hope. BRAVA, INDIA.ARIE!!
Grammy Nominations for THIS?: Short Review: After listening to this CD, I have lost faith in the Grammy Awards. I don't believe this woman was nominated for her "talent," as a recording artist, but for another reason.
Don't get it!!!!: It's nothing to do with her I just found this album MAJORLY BORING!!! I am very angry that I spent the last bit of my bday money on it. All the songs are really slow with this annoying drum in the background bum, bum, bum, bum. Then she comes wailing in with her terrible voice. The only thing I liked about it was the song "Video" and the guitar which is excellent, but sadly hidden under her wailing vocals. It literally put me to sleep the first time I popped it in. I was HIGHLY dissapointed.
ONLY LISTENED 2 VIDEO: yep, its official I LOVE video. only gd song on da album. i mean, she has gd voice but alicia keys & lauryn hill r WAY betta than her. glad she missed out on the 7 grammies she was up 4 in 2002
I hate india. arie: i hate this cd. her voice sounds like stinking bees! thru the whole thing she's all: um aa ummm, it makes me want to puke. i don't see why everyone likes her so much. she is very strange. i'm not trying to be mean, i'm trying to save you from buying this trash. india, do you think i am a fool? well i hope not. anyway, this cd is bad.
Soulful Record!: How refreshing to listen to this record. India sings with a heart and Soul that takes me back to another time.She reminds me of this record that came out years ago called Womanchild by Bemshi but updated for today. India keeps it real and like Jill Scott, Maceo Parker and Rodney Jones, "Soul Manifesto" cd is keeping the heart and soul in the music! Acoustic Soul is a must buy is you love Soul music. I bet her next record will be even better!
FRESH AND ENJOYABLE: ACOUSTIC SOUL introduces a new singer with a fresh voice and a fresh prospective. Her voice is rich and clean enough not to need all the musical override and remix that have come to be acceptable in the popular music business. In addition to clear and melodious pipes, India Arie sings the songs that today's woman should hear. The tune, VIDEO, clears says that she doesn't look like the girls in the music video. But more importantly, it says she's happy that she doesn't. The songs show a high level of self-acceptance and self-celebration. Her rendition of BROWN SKIN offers a kind of sensuality that makes you want to play that track over and over. Then she gives gratitude and tribute to the musicians from which she has gathered her style.This CD offers active dance music and tremendous mood music. It's truly well worth the purchase.
Essence of a Woman: India Arie speaks from the heart of all woman. Video is a message that was needed to be told. Her words are true poetry.
Disappointing debut from this neo-soultress: While India.Arie does deliver "acoustic soul" as the title of the album promises, this cd falls short of delivering the complex and unique sounds of other "neo-soul" artists such as Jill Scott or Erykah Badu. India.Arie has a sultry and beautiful voice, and it is apparent that she is a strong black woman deeply proud of her spiritual and ancestral roots. However, sometimes her lyrics come across as more preachy than proud. I also thought that her lyrics were trite and over simplified. There is more to songwriting than making sure the words rhyme. The first three tracks after the Intro, "Video", "Promises", and "Brown Skin" are the strongest tracks on the cd. But as I continued to listen, my excitement dwindled. Ms. Arie is a talented young woman, but she needs to work on her songwritting skills, and perhaps find stronger production. I believe her sophomore effort will be better.
Another word from Blighty - If you like Jill Scott....: Judging by the Album cover I thought it was going to be along the lines or Ladysmith Black Mam... whoever! I was watching MTV and saw "Video", totally swayed me, this album is a must, very similar to Jill Scott in terms of, put it on, sit back and enjoy the ease of listening... very calming & soothing music.
Great CD, Bright Future: For weeks, I had been listening to "Video" on the radio. The song was one that I felt that I could relate to. A couple of weeks ago, I heard an interview with India.Arie on NPR. They played some cuts off her CD and I fell in love. I immediately ran out to get it. I have truly enjoyed the entire CD. The first few tracks remind me of Tracy Chapman. I have played it so that one of my coworkers went out to buy a copy for himself. I look forward to hear what she will give us next.
Gorgeous stuff.: I also listened to the interview with Arie on NPR - thought "Video" was really refreshing. Having spun through it a number of times now, the song that keeps me hittin' 'replay' is "Ready for Love" - strong writing, music keeps pulling at you like an undertow, builds to a crash. My favorite lines so far:"Lately I've been thinkin' maybe you're not ready for me Maybe you think I need to learn maturity They say watch what you ask for, 'cuz you might receive..."The couple of songs where she lists her musical inspirations/ancestors got annoying on multiple plays. But a gorgeous CD, reminds me of Des'ree's first offering.
Music for the soul: This definitely a "must-have". If you liked the "Miseducation of Lauryn Hill", you will like "Acoustic Soul."
This is a tremendous step for music: Her music is unique, mellow and smooth. Her songs sound like something heard in upscale coffeehouses catering to educated business folk. Her first single, the highly acclaimed "Video," is the epitome of radio candy without being the fluff that happened to be popular in early 2001 when it was released (Britney Spears and the boy bands instantly may come to mind). India Arie is her name and she's about as soulful and introspective as anyone can be. Her music reflects everyday situations and real life. Sure, not all of this CD soars as much as the aforementioned "Video," "Brown Skin" and "Promises" do, and that's sad because it's doubtful anything else other than that instant first single received airplay; but this talented singer-songwriter's debut Acoustic Soul is still brilliant, soothing as a first sip of coffee and as delightful as taking that first swallow and feeling the warmth down your esophagus.
I can feel you India: Ok. I gave this cd 4 stars instead of 5 just because I'm not a liberal when it comes to giving out the twinkles. But I must say that this is a pretty good album. India is more than a singer she's also an artist. Unlike many of albums I was able to listen to this album in it's entirety. My favorite songs on this album are Video, Back to the middle, and Nature. I like Video because she seems to be a girl after my own heart. I like Come back to the middle because it focuses on balance (It's as important to have a balanced mind as it is a balanced meal). And last but not least I love Nature because it's great advice for those entering into relationships.
Good debut: from a talented young lady. This is one of the best soul albums of the last few years. Her voice is really smoothing and she's a good lyricist. It's a great feel-good record, she seems like such a positive and sweet girl. Everytime I'm feeling down this is one of the best albums to put on to make me will better. "Video", "Strenght, courage and Wisdom", and the others always put a smile on my face. Another really well-made song is "Ready for love". The cd has it highs and lows,but overall it's a made-well album.
I love this Cd!: This Cd is awesome. Every song has a meaning. Its so empowering to listen and understand the words and the meaning.I really think that India Arie should have won a Grammy. Her Cd is so much better than Alicia Keys.I think everyone should listen to the cd and understand it.SO BUY IT!
Beautiful Songwriting, Lovely Voice, Catchy Melodies!: I try to listen to this CD everyday. I drew a pencil picture of India and it was praised by everyone I know.This girl has wonderful vocals, perfectly matched with her soulful R&B songs. My favorites on the album are obviously 'Video', that's my song!, 'Promises' is absolutely fabulous, and of course, 'Brown Skin' is sultry and very beautiful.The only track that's a little...unmusical(?) would be 1., which is an intro describing a list of 'in-remembrance' African American artists. It would be better written than sang, for sometimes it's a bit hard to incorporate names into a song.
The Best: India Arie - She is an awesome songstress. I am impatiently awaiting her next album. Found it very strange that she didnt get aGrammy. She was on Jay Leno two nites ago and she was just simply the best! Sometimes you have great artists and they just never get their due. Not to worry India, just continue to do the great work!Stella
Good Music, So So album: India's intentions are appreciated but I think that she misses the mark. The music is very good but the lyrics are a little too simple to be profound. A good departure from the current state of R&B which lacks substance and creativity, but not enough to make me play over and over like "Mama's Gun". All the songs are anti-climactic, and no one stands out above the rest, but India's calming voice makes you listen 'til the end. Sophmore effort will probably be better.
India Arie: I saw her perform on a morning show, Regis, I believe, and she was great! She did her signature song, India Arie. Unfortunately, for the CD, this was the best song. I guess I thought from seeing her live that she was in a more "universal" mode - meaning, strength in herself, being herself (built from heritage, but transpiring it). From one poet to another, I was really excited that she wrote her own songs. That counts for a lot! However, my excitement was followed by big disappointment in that there were no printed words. What's up with sharing?
Refreshing and Beautiful: "Acoustic Soul" is one of my all-time favorite CDs, and I have over two hundred in my collection. It's hardly left my CD player since I bought it. India.Arie has an incredible amount of talent; she is a lovely singer, and has a steady touch on the guitar. Her lyrics are refreshingly honest and introspective; there is nothing of the vapid music dominating radio stations on this album. Every song is solid, with great hooks and lovely melodies. I enjoy singing along to every one (how often can you say that?). I listen to "Acoustic Soul" during any mood: when I'm feeling thoughtful, it's a quiet accompaniment; when I'm angry or stressed, it's calming; during happy times, it bounces along cheerily with me. I really can't say enough good things about this album. India.Arie is a great addition to the music community; I look forward to her next offering.
I was floored when I heard this CD!: I'm glad that there's something positive, truthful, fresh, and sexy that I can listen too. Erykah's hypnotic anguish has to take a back seat to India's soulfully honest renditions of life and love (of self). The beats are lush and flavorful and the lyrics are right on. If you don't have it then go get it. If you have it then buy one for a friend. We need to promote the positive and refute the 0. I pray that India (and the like) stay around for a while.
underhyped: by which i mean to say, this album is mindblowing, and you should get it now! the entire album is a such a refreshing change from the same-ol' stale r+b music out there. it's fresh -- it rings with her beautiful guitar playing instead of being laden with samples from countless other songs; it's beautiful -- her voice is one of the most gifted out there today -- rich, deep, and smooth, with such a range (unlike alicia keys' voice, which sounds tinny and shallow in comparison); her lyrics are inspiring, uplifting, joy-inducing; and the grooves, which make me bounce around in my seat when i'm listening to this album at work, are just SO GOOD! (esp. on brown skin. that is my fave, groove-wise). so GET THIS ALBUM! and forget about alicia keys. what an overhyped disappointment she was. i only wish that india.arie played piano; i'm still hoping for an r+b woman piano player to come along and knock my socks off, like fiona apple but a little more soul-tinged.
India.Arie is like fresh air: She is a breath of fresh air when the worl;d of R & B needs it most. With all the fake groups like Destiny's child and the other man haters India Arie has made an album that deserves all the acclaim that it has recieved. Her voice is so soulful it makes me shudder to hear it cause it is so good. The songs are all well written and produced. India Arie is here and is not going anywhere.
Nothing else to be said.....: Soul touching music.... the sista takes you on a calming thought provoking smooth ride....a must have.
Acoustic Soul: I really enjoy her music and find myself listening to this CD quite a bit. This CD is reflective and any artist that makes you think in a positive way is worth a mention, but she makes her guitar sing as well. When you've finish listening to this CD you feel the strength,courage and wisdom she has put in making this music. A great choice for your collection.
GOT TRICK INTO THE VIDEO SONG: "Video" highlighted my expectations to this album, Video it's such a great song, great message, and makes you remember of the good music that was use to be made, but it's a fact that most of the rest of the album is pretty boring and forgettable. The worth tracks here are the leading single "Video" and "Streght, Courage and Wisdom". Sadly I have to say that the cover of the album stands out, but the music not.
Soul? Where?!: I really looked forward to listening to "Acoustic Soul." India has a great voice, and I believe that with some assistance with lyrics, and a new producer, she can be a moderately successful entertainer. But this album was a letdown. I thought that maybe it would grow on me, but "Strength, Courage and Wisdom," seemed strained and made me lose patience. "Brown Skin" is beautiful, and I hope the song gets play, its the one standout on this CD.
Huge Dissapointment: I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this album...god after reading all the great reviews I wanted to LOVE it. "Video" is really, really good. "Brown Skin" is fairly adequate, and "Ready for Love" is pretty. But the rest of the songs really lack the catchy vibe, and upbeat tempo that I love. If you like slow songs, and guitar playing-which she is excellent at, than try this album, but if you love Lauryn Hill, stay away. The two can't even be compared. They are both so talented, but in totally different ways. "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" will forever be my favorite cd. India.Arie is incredibly talented, but it's just not my thing, and I totally wasn't feeling her.
Drop the Acoustic Guitar \ and learn to play the guitar: There are a few songs I like, but seriously drop the tired ass riff playing guitar...get a better production, her lyrics are descent, a little too much preaching, but OK...I couldn't listen to the whole CD, sorry
Sorry, but...: Liked the song I heard on "Oprah" (Video), but just didn't hear what Stevie heard in the rest of it.
pleasant surprise: I had heard about India.Arie for awhile, but was not familiar with her music at all. This past weekend when I went to see Sade in in concert, she was the opening act. All I have to say is that she is wonderful....immediately went the next day and bought the album and it does not disappoint. The hook for me was when she sang "Ready For Love" as an encore...the album version is just as good. Try to listen to this album without experiencing chills several times. I'm not going to dissect the various songs, as I have only listened to this about 3 times. Read the other reviews and you'll see that this is definitely an artist to explore and watch.
The BOMBDIGGITY!!!!!!!!!: This CD is awesome!!!! It is a must have for everyone's CD collection. I like all of the songs on this CD, especially "Beautiful", "Brown Skin", "NAture" and "Always In My Head". Practically every song has a message which you don't usually find in today's music. When I first heard "Video" on the radio I loved the song. But I am always hesitant to buy a CD without hearing at least two songs first. This was not the case for Miss India. Arie! I do not regret this purchase, it was so worth the wait. Listening to this CD gives me a feeling of euphoria and it will be one of my favorite CD's from now on!!You are wonderful INDIA!!!!
What a talented woman!: This is one of those CDs that screamed to me "take me home"---so I did and I am so glad I did! I had never heard of india.arie when I saw this CD, but something told me I just had to have it. india.arie is one talented woman and I'm sure we will hear more from her in the years to come. She writes her own music and plays the acoustic guitar. She has a sound all her own---and what a sound! When I listen to this CD I am touched someplace deep in my soul. I hope she releases another CD soon.....before I wear this one out!
Thank you, Sade!: I caught the Sade concert last night (fantastic show). Opening for that amazing lady was India Arie, a performer I had never even heard of. Thank you, Sade, for turning me on to one of the most heartfelt singer/songwriters I have heard in some time. I bought India's CD at the show and have been listening to it non-stop for 24 hours. Despite my relative naivete, I am blown away by the mix of groove, peace, and emotion the blend of vocals and strings on this CD has. Shades of Jill Scott, Sade, Dionne Farris, Me'Shell Ndegeocello, and even Lauren Hill ring through this sound. I think this lady will be around for quite some time.
Exquisite, simply exquisite: Pure satisfaction guaranteed. India Arie is a very talented young lady. Her songs appeal to your soul. It is tasteful and full of meaningful verses. It is my type of music. If you like, Sade, Jill Scott, you will dig India. Brown skin, Video and Promises are my favorite songs. My 5-year old daughter loves the song video and said that she was glad it did not have any bad words. This is music the family can enjoy. It is nice to listen to music that is appealing to everyone who comes in contact with it. My husband said he even liked it!!!! Go buy and help the sister reach the top!!!
A Rare Musical Gem: It's about time that more and more people discover the musical creations of India.Arie. Michael Mann incorporated one of her songs, 'Ready for Love', in his stylish '06 Miami Vice motion picture.By listening to each song you can tell that a lot of work and art went into its creation. India Arie is not just another pretty voice, but instead there's much more to her as the whole CD has a lot of substance and she puts true soul into each song.Her sultry voice soothes while she tells a story. Also the instrumentation is very well arranged with taste and applications in all the right places. This CD is a rare musical gem from an artist who comes across as believable and as someone who loves to do what they do.
It is amazing.: I have to agree with everyone else that this is a mind-shattering CD! India Arie not only has an amazing, awe-inspiring voice, but deep lyrics and beautiful music to accompany it. The title of the CD describes it all: Acoustic Soul. Listen to the samples and you will be hooked.
ADVANCE COPY: This CD is brilliant. I had the glory of having the CD 2 months before it came out. Ms. Arie just adds more flavor to the sound that everybody is coming around to. Her tribute to Stevie Wonder is off the hook. I wish her the best in the future and all who have this album, enjoy it, because you are listening to a future great! 1
The Best R&B Album I've Heard In A Long Time: This album is nothing short of smashing. India Arie has the true voice of a Queen and the soul of our ancestors. The entire album is filled with phenomenal lyrics, extraordinary music, and a superb, harmonious voice! I hope this album goes at least triple platinum! To all of you who are considering burning this CD...please do not! Purchase it for yourself so that we can support this sister! I hope to hear many more beautiful albums from this gorgeous Nubian Queen!One!
India Arie - Acoustic Soul: To keep it simple, overall one for my collection. It started great then lost the plot big time in the middle, brought it back together for a great ending.
Amazing Voice, Amazing Talent ---> Buy this CD: I was really impressed with this CD it is a must have. My favorite on the CD is brown skin.
Superb: I will never see another year where such a talented person goes without winning one Grammy. Keep on doing what you do. . .India. . just be you.
Magical: I'm not sure on what show my husband and I first heard/saw India Arie. What I do know is that we were in amazement and hooked instantly. Incredible voice. Incredible sound. She is truly magical.We now have this cd and we love it. India Arie is so smooth. What a pleasure it is to be carried away by her fresh soulful voice.India Arie - we look forward to your next album!
Awesome CD! Just Press Play!: I love this CD, she is a great singer, song writer, and musician! The songs have great lyrics with deep meaning, the beats are all good, and the feel of this CD is one that makes me smile and wanna dance! She's very positive and smooth! I'd highly recommend getting this CD if you like even 1 of her songs! The whole CD is good in my opinion, and that is hard to find today!
Good girls can win (or at least get nominated)!: I liked almost every song off this album. Arie's stylish and polished debut proved that she will be one of the many that will outlast the Britneys and Pinks. Her voice, a combination of Nina Simone, Tracy Chapman, and Lauryn Hill, melts over you and leaves you feeling oh-so-high. I know it's not the same thing, but I'd put this up there with Erykah Badu's debut album as far as sophistication and songwriting. Try "Back to the Middle" and "Promises."
Much better than Alicia Keys!: I think it's outrageous that Alicia Keys managed to win 5 grammy awards, and India Arie won none! Arie's album is much, much much stronger with constant cool laid back vibes!She has a soulful voice, which reminds me of some classic Motown artists. The song's have more depth and strength than Keys', BUY THIS!!!!
Acoustic Soul of a True Artist: I have to say that I was really disappointed with the turnout of events from the Grammy's. How could talent like Ms. Arie's not be given it's due credit? This is a CD that can be enjoyed from beginning to end and you really feel the spirit of the artist, not like other artists' trying to fit in someone else's mold. India Arie truly changed the way I view musical talent with the soulful stringing of her guitar. "Video" was given the most credit from the album, but songs like "Ready for Love" and "Back to the Middle" are the best songs on the CD. Though Ms. Keys' debut "Fallin" and "A Woman's Worth" were very good songs, these didn't beat the acoustic guitar of India. In my book, she is still a winner.
Heartfelt and Personal: Only after listening to India Arie's second CD, Voyage to India, that I finally realize how good Acoustic Soul is. While very good, Voyage isn't quite up there with Acoustic Soul. Simple, catchy, and honest, there isn't an uncomfortable note nor a corny word in Acoustic Soul. I guarantee that you will listen to this whole CD without skipping one song. Video, Simple, and Part of My Life will have you humming along with their catchy beats, while Back in the Middle, Ready for Love and Beautiful are honest and well, beautiful. But above all, the one song that separates India Arie from the rest is Brown Skin, which is original lyrically and brilliant musically. Acoustic Soul is undoubtedly one of my favorite CDs of all time and my only advice to you is to buy this CD and give it sometime to grow on you. You will not be disappointed!
Great cd! On a whole different level!: This is a great cd.She deserves the same respect as jill scott and eyrkah badu.Brown skin is a beautiful song, and I hope she releashes it as a single.The songs are from a spritual base and for that reason some people may find it boring,(because it's not like that crap that is played on r&b radio.)but boring it is not.A very uplifting and funky cd that should be checked out!
Don't Miss This One ...: India is truely a breath of fresh air. I just got this CD last night but I have been listening to her every moment that my eyes have been open. Don't Miss This One! Soulful!
*7* Grammy Nominations ... Need I say more?: I was compelled to express my gratitude to the music industry and it's critics, for their acknowledgement of this profound ARTIST. India's talent and creativity DESERVE the upmost recognition. Primarily, because she refuses to compromise for the sake of record sales, or a shallow image. "Video" speaks for itself, and is a reflection of India's personal journey. While listening to the captivating "Ready For Love", one is brought to to the realization, that a position in the "Album of the Year" category, is not displaced. Concrete, confident and inspiring, "Acoustic Soul" is a "DIAMOND IN THE RUFF" and worth every listen.
great album: I am into many different genres of music, but I have noticed lately alot of less-than-stellar female vocalists (ex. nelly furtado). I think India.arie has a great voice and she has the ability to turn a basic three chord guitar line that has been used in 50 other songs into something original and special. This is a very good album.
a breathe of "soulful air": Hearing humming and a guitar as an intro is going to catch your attention and seeing "Video" will glue you to the television. Here we have a "sister" letting us know its alright to be "natural". Arie has a true story to tell in each song and each track has its own identity demanding us to listen to and feel it. Arie gives much respect to those who paved the way before her and allows us to relate with many of them through her "soulful" sound. You won't be able to focus on just the lyrics, whether its the mellow sound of the guitar and vocals or the strong backbeats, Arie is going to grab you somehow. Although i know her cd will encourage "all" women to think positve, her cd will have great influence on African-american women to teach us to love and repect ourselves and our "BROWNSKIN". porsha ... a soulful fan
Acoustic Soul Angel: I - IntactN - NotableD - DynamicI - IntactA - AliveA - Amour propreI - IntactR - RelaxingE - EnergizingWhat more can I say.
This is a god CD: Always searching for just that right song, and you will find it on this CD, full of emotions, that middle of the road whine down and exhale music. Real Music, breath of fresh air music. I'm still a funkateer, so after a mellow time with a glass of wine and India, I throw on my party attire, and pop my Dawn Silva CD in the ride and off to the party a humping I will go.
Don't buy this!: $80 for a 25 minute DVD! I wanted to get driver's ed info for my 16 year old son and this DVD was a waste of money for us! It covers signs, lines on the road, very basic stuff. The web site only provides a very basic question test. A great dissappointment. Maybe the DVD could be used as the first video in a driver's ed high school class.
not that good looking watch: i bought this casio watch. it's a little bit pricey. the battery didn't last long. the watch looks old fashion. i would rather buy the kenneth cole than that watch
Not useful: You'd have to be a very accomplished 2D animator to make use of this book. The notion of doing everything in hand drawn 2D first is interesting but probably not an efficient detour for most people who are trying to become acquainted with 3D animation.
A untrue story!: This is a book by a Government agent. He claims to be a Sikh but research shows that he just has a Sikh name to cover up his caste which is considered a low caste in India. He is definitely not an authentic Sikh .The book only portrays a Government view and is a biased
Well written and a different perspective: Being a Sikh myself, I purchased this book to get a different perspective on the Operation. I must say that it is well written but sometimes the author (who himself led the operation) makes superfluous claims about the circumstances existing at that time. I think the content could have been more and the author could have put some more mental imagery and thoughts into writing rather than only describing the sequence of events. Highlight was some of the pictures which are in the book and I had never seen before.Good read; Some rare unseen photographs; A different perspective.
Must read book: A must read book on Operation Blue Star. Clears a lot of myths about the event and highlights why the operation couldn't have been avoided in order to preserve the national security of India.
Excellent book and an eye opener!: Until I read this book, I was mislead by a false account of history that was told to me from different people!Highly Recommended !
ONE SIDED: The above review from the person from california is absolutely incorrect. I think the person has the wrong book. In no way was this book ever banned in India, rather encouraged. This is a biased one sided work that wasted so many trees in publication. For the sake of saving our environment as well as your time I recommend a more thorough and unbiased work titled: "Fighting for Faith and Nation: by Cynthia Mahmood.
BOOK is not the TRUE story: i am also a sikh but i would give this book only one star. sure it was interesting to read about what happened during the attack on the golden temple...but this book was NOT the true story! Instead, it was a lot of BIASED B.S. it only gives the viewpoint of the indian army and is full of outright lies about innocent sikhs who were beaten, tortured and killed by the indian soldiers. I bought this book because i wanted to hear some more insight on what went on in 1984..its too bad that this book was only written to make the sikhs look bad with a lot of indian army b.s. i would recommend mark tully's book on amritsar instead. It is a more reputable read
Don't Read this Book: I suggest all the people that don't buy this book because the author was Indian government agent during the operation of Blue Star. He didn't write a lot of things that happened but instead he wrote good things about Indian government that Indian troops took their shoes off before entering Golden Temple but it's not true. All the troops had their shoes on in the Golden Temple. I even has seen the pictures. So I request everyone not to read this book.
Terrible: Besides for Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, the worst book I've ever read. Illogical, arrogant, proselytizing ramblings! I want my time and my money back.
an intellectual diversion: I will not dupe you into thinking that B.F. Skinner is a master novelist, and that is the only reason I docked B.F. one star. However there are so many interesting ideas in here that you really need to read it if you would like a book that is enjoyable, but also leaves you with something to think about for months after you've read it. Whether you agree or not, you should read it!
Fascinating blueprint for utopian society: If you're interested in psychology and/or sociology at all, you'll enjoy this book. Skinner has some unique insights about communal living. This book will make you think about how society works. Pretty good read, too.
An excellent institution of modern behavioral engineering: An experminetal community that is on the border of morality and immorality. It questions whether or not behavioral engineering limits or adds to the freedom of the inhabitants of Walden Two. The many theories and problems (and the solutions) of the nature and behavior of humans are used to shape the community.
a tragic disappointment: What could have been an extroardinarly clever, engaging text is an inch-thick preaching of the merits of behavioralism, bashing Freudian theory as worthless. As a student of psychology, I have studied many many different fields and theories and though I would not consider myself an exclusive behavioralist, it is apparent that many of the tactics of behavioralism are valid, effective conditioning techniques. This book presents such techniques with repetition and monotony, pointless characters, and no plot. It is an inane textbook, conditioning the reader to unconditionally accept behavioralism as an authority, treating the reader as if he were a child.
Extremely challenging ideas, but no strong foundation: I read Walden Two as part of a class assignment, studying the effects of secular humanism and other worldviews on this world. The book itself is full of extremely challenging in its ideas. It raises many points that can have a person strong in their faith even take these ideas and ponder them. What if it really could work? Skinner does a good job presenting his ideas, but he has no basis or foundation for which to rest them on. The inconsistancies of his thoughts stand out more than the characters themselves. If Skinner is hailed as an exceptional psychologist, why then can ten high school juniors take every one of his ideas and prove why they can't work? Also, these juniors can take his ideas, match them up with the worldview that applies (Naturalism), and predict where, why, and how his plans will fail.
Behaviorism Give Us A Way To Achieve Humansitic Goals: Everything B.F. Skinner did was to give us an understanding of how to improve the human condition. The science of human behavior has eliminated criiminal behavior, improved education and self confidence, has perpetuated moral behavior, has perpetuated personal responsibility, eliminated obsessive behavior, cured autism, etc... and has given us understanding to solve every human problem. He was named humanist of the year in 1972. Walden Two isn't scary. Walden Two is thrilling. It shows that scientific advancement is not only preferrable to the lottery system we have in place now, it is necessary. Read this book as an anti-dote to the hateful ignorant propaganda spewed endlessly by Brave New World, Ayn Rand, Noam Chomsky, etc... Hopefully you will enjoy learning real possiblities that would allow for a better life.
Interesting concept, with boring characters and no plot.: Walden Two is a book that could have been great but suffers from one flaw: it's boring!! The book reads like a lecture with occasional debate. Skinner definately intrigues me with his thoughts on behavioral engineering, and the concept of a utopian society in the midst of present day society is very intriguing. However, there is basically no plot and very little character development in this book and thus it suffers. 1984 doesn't read like a blue print discussing the society instead it's a story about Winston and Julia through which we learn about the society. I wish Walden Two was less of lecture and more of a story.
Very Worth Reading: If you're a thinking person, read _Walden Two_. When I first picked it up, I expected a boring piece of behaviorist propaganda by a stuffy man in a lab coat. I was wrong. In the end, the book is about where humanity is vs. where we might like to be--and, most importantly, how to get there. Whatever you think of Skinner's answers, his book is worth reading for the questions alone. (Note--the criticism that _WT_ isn't much of a philosophic novel along the lines of _1984_ is correct; it much more reminds me of a Platonic dialogue. Not a bad thing, if you ask me.)
Awesome: This is a wonderful CD by a wonderful new artist. What inspiration. I was fortunate enough to see her in concert with Michael W. Smith and she brought the house to their feet. You can just feel the music with her.
Stellar Debut: Blind since the age of two, Ginny is still your average person: she can cook, do laundry, clean house, iron clothes, put makeup on and climb trees. But her charming pop-rock songs reveal a gift of second sight into the real meaning of God. Includes the hits "Free" and "I Am Nothing" plus "I Want To be Moved"; " Without Condition"; the classic "Be Thou My Vision"; "Land Of The Grey" and more. Guest harmonies from Michael W. Smith.
Beautiful music & thoughtful lyrics.: I just recently purchased this CD after hearing her played on an Internet radio station that normally plays the likes of Sarah McLaughlin, John Mayer, etc... I loved her sound so much that I checked it out on Amazon & discovered that she was in fact a "Christian" artist. Normally, I'm not a fan of Christian music, even though I am, in fact a Christian, but most of what I've heard in the past have been groups that hit you over the head with messages and have a very cheap sound to them. But this CD is contrary to what I've been exposed to in the past... it's beautiful, and the message is delivered sweetly and thoughtfully... with respect given to not only God, but her listeners as well. If I were to sum her up, I'd personally describe her as the "Christian Jonatha Brooke". Not a bad thing at all, considering Jonatha is my favorite female songwriter/singer. Other Christian artists... take note!!
Wow...: This is my first Ginny Owens cd and there will be more. She is such an inspiration with such a beautiful voice.
I Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This cd is excellent!!!!! I heard some of the track a week before it was released and every track they had played I liked. This cd is a little old school and a little new school but if you are a Carl Thomas fan you will like it. The first track "Let's Talk About It" reminds you of a Marvin Gaye sound,"She Is featuring LLCoolJ is more of a Stepper's song if you are from Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and the list goes on. The Baby Maker is Neo-Soul if you were raised in the 70's it on that style of music. This cd will never be as good as debut "Emotional" but it can be if you just give it a chance.
The Hotness: Carl Thomas is an incredible vocalist, who brought the same flavor from the last album. Most new artist's 2nd album don't really compare to the first one, but I can really say that this album is great. All yall real Carl Thomas fans, He did more poetry on this album. He has some tight up beat tempo songs one produced by "Jus Blaze", but he also brought those soul tracks as well. Carl Thomas has done it again! ! ! You won't regret the purchase. Go get it today! ! !
A Whole Lot More: Carl Thomas' album is one that I have been anticipating for a while. Summer rain instantly made me a fan and I've been waiting for some new stuff from him. The wait was well worth it. I'm starting out with the aucoustic guitar and the guitar in "My love" really caught my attention and has me wanting to cop the chords for that piece so that maybe I can learn to play that. Also, the inspiration in "Dreamer" is something that speaks to me as my dreams are seeming unattainable right now. It really soothed my soul when I heard that song. The thing that sealed the deal as a good album for me was the sultry sounds of "Make it Alright". I love the whole vibe and feel of the music on this song. This is definantly an album worth copping.
review: This album has very smooth sound, Carl Thomas' voice is very Luther-esque. I highly recommend this album, spring is coming up and these songs are perfect for a sunny day. He gracefuly changes from one vocal style to another. hes the R&B pride of bad boy, and doesnt get enough credit. the album is produced y puff daddy, full of hits.
FABULOUS: THIS CD IS AMAZAING EVEN IF IT WAS PRODUCED BY P.DIDDY. CARL THOMAS DOES IT AGAINGREG LASSITERwww.misguidedproduction.com
Let's not talk about it: After Emotional where every single song was top shelf, he comes back with this? I think Carl is very suited for sultry love songs. Let's Talk About It did nothing for me. There were two songs on the CD that I actually liked, the rest were blah blah blah...Carl I love you so get back to the basics and produce another album with the quality and texture of EMOTIONAL.
ok i'll talk abit bout it: Carl has a great voice! i enjoy this album alot.My Fav Song is "My First Love". "Rebound" and "The Baby Maker" are also good. I heard "She Is" featurin LL to much but it was a great song.good work Mr. Thomas
Real Music: Even after a lengthy hiatus, Carl continues to impress with his silky voice and mellow tunes. Like other sophomore efforts, one may expect "Let's Talk About It" to be "Emotional Pt 2". Although it's not quite the case, Carl still offers real flavor with music that makes buying CD's worthwhile. The best tracks are: the U2 inspired "Let Me Know", the old school "The Baby Maker" and "But Me". Who can forget Malik Yusef? Well, he reappears with "Know It's Alright", which should have been a full track in my opinion. Carl Thomas is an underrated singer and performer that puts on a fantastic show for those that appreciate real music even with the road Contemporary R&B has taken lately.
Let's Talk About It...: I know music, been writing music for years now. Music is my life; I also write music professionally.This CD is just as good or even better than EMOTIONAL. Although Emotional had some seriously GREAT songs, this does too and is very consistant on quality. Good job Carl! Must buy!JUST BUY THE DAMN CD ITS AWESOME!--------------------My Rating System is based on Amazon's:* = Hate It** = I Don't Like It*** = It's Ok**** = I Like It***** = I LOVE IT!--------------------
No Sophmore Slump: Although this album is not as striking as his first, Carl Thomas has proven he is no one-hit wonder. There are no obvious singles and although I find myself fast forwarding a few cuts, this is still an very good CD.
Does not deliver!: I am a fan of Carl Thomas and I think he is very talented but his sophmore album is no where near as good as the first one. There are two songs on the cd that I do like alot which is played on urban radio stations but the rest of the songs on the album needs more work (maybe a few remixes would spice it up a little).
Needs to try a new producer: I looooooved Carl Thomas' first CD and could not wait for this one to drop! Major disappointment. He only had maybe 2 good song on the CD and the rest were garbage. Please try again Carl and do those lovely, soulful ballads that put you on the map in the first place.
NOT GOOD AT ALL: NOT MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THIS ALBUM AT ALLTHERE ARE ONLY TWO GOOD SONGS ON THIS ALBUMI LIKE CARL THOMAS FIRST ALBUM BUT THIS ONEHERE IS A NO NO I WOULD NOT BUT AT AFTER AGOOD PAL LET ME HERE IT
GUESS I'M MISSING IT!!!: Just like the debut CD, "Emotional", this is almost as boring. Extremely bland music spells disaster for this project. "I Wish" is the only excellent composition on the previous CD, and nothing comes close to that on "Let's Talk About It". The first single, "She Is", a tired Surface sample that R.Kelly have already used on his "R" album, was a flop, and "Make It Alright" is struggling on the charts as well. Need I say more? Carl Thomas is in desperate need of good producers. Someone please call Jam & Lewis, Dre & Vidal, Joshua P. Thompson, Gerald Levert and Babyface, just to name a few.
Carl does it again: Carl Thomas manages to display his great talents yet again in his second release. He continues to grow as an artist on this cd. This is certainly a cd you can just put in the cd player and never touch the forward button.
carl carl carl: Hes back and damn im glad... while this cd is different than the first... its obvious he's grown and he reflects that wonderfully on this cd. Hes one cute M&M..... his voice is very sensual.. i love him and its great he's back. Another artist u can credit w/ tryin to help the betterment of music today.
Pretty Good CD: OMG I loved Carl Thomas' new CD. I cant say that I have a favorite song because i loved them all. He needs to keep doing his thing and not let anything stop him. If you havent picked up his CD then you need to go out and do that.
The album is great: The album is great. i have always admired carl thomos's smooth introverted behaviour, and now he paints his character all over the album. The album is smooth, it makes it seem like it is raining out side. songs like " Rebound" is like a mixture of sade and marvin gaye. This is an album to keep, no arguments.
It's okay if you are into polyster.: I'm sure there are advantages to polyester - but I am not a fan of it. I think it doesn't "breathe" well or feel good on your skin - this top falls into that category. If you like polyester, this is a nice roomy top. I do think it looks a little bit cheap - but it's not horrible - and, again, the fit is good.
Should be: Snorkeling - How to buy and wear the equipment: I wanted a book to teach me how to snorkel. This book teaches you how to evaluate and purchase the equipment to snorkel, and how to wear the equipment, but not how to USE the equipment!!! I see pictures of people diving underwater while wearing a snorkel - how do they do that without the snorkel filling up with water? Oh sure, I can figure out that if I lay on the water face down and have a snorkel in my mouth I can still breath, but I wanna know how to do more... This didn't even really touch on the basics...But in fairness - It is a very good guide on how to purchase, wear, and maintain your first set of snorkeling gear...
You get what you pay for...: I needed a car charger and was thrilled to find one for such a cheap price but of course, "if it looks too good to be true, it probably is" and in this case it unfortunately was. This charger feel apart in my hands LITERALLY the first time I connected it to my blackberry pearl. The piece that connects to the phone dissembled right away before I was ever able to use it. I definitely do not recommend this product.
Do NOT do business with Bargaincell!: Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective. This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. Consider yourself warned.
good item: very satisfied. received it on time with no issues. would buy from this person again. Hope this helps others with their decision to buy from them.
hard to use,poorly printed,vocabulary for bible thumpers: Written in 1887. This book is the worst language book I have ever used. I can't spell or pass a grammer test but this book stinks. For example Page 141-exercise to exihibit typical Nepali idioms " If ye had faith as (much as) a grain of mustard seed ye would say to this sycamine tree, Be rooted up ....." The grammer is presented in a format that is very tricky to understand and seems to be endless. At the end of the book is an Army Formulary with sentances like "Eight days' imprisonment with hard labour." translated into Nepali. This book is hard to find and that is one of its best charateristics. It has a lovely red solid hard cover and my copy will certainly last untill I throw it out.
A Real Page-Turner: A Bride in a bloody wedding dress who can't remember who she is or where the blood came from. Why is no one searching for her? What about her fiance? What? She has TWO? You will keep turning pages as the bride and her ex-cop friend try to bring back her memories. But our ex-cop finds himself falling in love with her--does he want to discover her past or start a new future with her? I could not put this book down because bits and pieces of her memory kept surfacing. Very well written and very believable. One of Ms. Steward's best.
"Private Vows": A Surprising good read!: Well, this book does start off a bit slow. However, by Chapter 3 (page 40) things start to pick of steam! After Cole Grayson accedentally ran into Mary Jackson who ran into the middle of the street, she lost her memory. However, there was blood on her Wedding dress. Where did that blood come from and who was she marring? She doesn't remember her past. After a few days, Cole finds himself fiercly attracted to Mary. He soon discovers Mary feels the same strong desire. Afterwards, many secrets are reveled! What stunning secrets are reveled? Why is no one looking for her? Is there violence? Does Cole and Mary's heated attraction blossom into a full-ledged love affair? You will have to get this book and read it to find out the rising action, climax and exciting ending to this breathtaking romantic suspense novel! "Private Vows" quickly becomes an exciting page-turner that will leave you satisfied, in more ways than one, believe me!
Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror: Excellent writing in explaining the Web of Terror. Very timely in what is occuring in Global Terrorism. A book that should be read by American people and Government officials. It is the first book that I have seen that lays out a strategy to win the War on Terror.
Blueprint for disaster: This book represents the hardest-line right wing elements in and near the Bush administration. It cheerfully entertains plans for US attacks on Syria and North Korea. I agree with much of Mr. Steele's review above -- except when he calls the book "uninformed." If only it were! I fear it is informed on precisely one point, the extremists' agenda. Particularly interesting is the appendix, with photographs of the author meeting key figures before the Iraqi war. One of these is Israeli Defense Minister Mofaz. There is another person in the room, whose face has been blurred for security. It couldn't be Richard Perle?Those researching the Bush administration may want to buy this book to add to their collection of evidence. Those wanting a broader discussion of terrorism and global problems can do much better.
NeoCon-Likud and Southern Evangelical Fanatics in Uniform: This book is as scholarly and credible as the "fair and balanced" news coverage of Fox News which the writers shamelessly plug as their new found sinecure. The disaster that is American foreign and national security policy today is a direct result of these ethno-sectarian fanatics with connections to the Neo-Con Likud movement and the Southern Evangelical Armageddon churches. The vast majority of us Americans dont share their ethnic or sectarian affiliations and must work to defeat their use of our blood and treasure at home and abroad. If you want credible analysis on these issues read real "experts" and academics such as James Bamford, Anthony Zinni, Rashid Khalidi, John Mearsheimer, Richard Clark, or a dozen other writers outside this incestious cabal.
Too bad...: It's too bad that people think of anyone that is not American as an animal that the world needs to be rid of. Perhaps there is something we are missing here, if we seek to understand other human beings even though we have different points of view it's possible that we can find some common ground and let each other be. If the U.S. had not so badly victimized these people, maybe they wouldn't hate us so much. Unfortunately this book does not illustrate any of that. It's a one way view, but I'm not surprised since the authors are regulars on Fox news!
Endgame: A very well written book on ending terrorism and the fight it will take to end it. This book will make you think and take you into the heart of all the players of the endgame. The authors are very well up on whats at work the world over, who to watch and what needs to be done before its to late. The list of players is a long list and the list could grow longer if the blueprint for victory isn't followed. A book every one should read-Larry Hobson-Author- The Day Of The Rose
Complete Garbage: Little more than propoganda, the book is slanderous and so frequently speaks without evidence that it is without any use. If you're a true believer and want somebody to tell you what you already think, then enjoy. I couldn't get much past the second chapter, when the book rambeled on with baseless accusations and an assortment of silly baseless suggestions. Complete and utter garbage.
Not worth the paper its printed on!: Quite possibly the worst book ever written. Starting with the prologue where Oliver North blames everything but natural disasters on liberals to the main body of the book that reinforces the notion that generals should really stick to military matters and leave issues of a political and diplomatic nature to the politicians. Truly poor selection...I'm glad McInerney is in no position to make the decisions he advocates in the book!
A must read: Starting with the forward by Col. North this book holds your attention. The Generals' book is well written and gives a clear, concise picture of the War on Terror and what our response needs to be in order to be victorious. We need to realize that we are fighting for our civilization and our way of life and we need to stand together to defeat the terrorists. This book is a must read and I would recommend it to anyone.
A Clear Vision of the Threat We Face: Generals McInerney and Vallely articulate a clear vision of the global terrorism we currently face and present a well-crafted road map for America to defeat the threat. The authors bring decades of military and global security experiences to address a thorny problem - The War on Terror. They address the larger issue of the clash of cultures in a way everyone can understand. The lessons learned from September 11 are slowly fading from the memories of many of our elected officials. We, the people, have to hold their feet to the fire to pass effective legislation that enhances our national security. This author strongly recommends that all concerned Americans read this book.
Great truths found in this book rarely found in other books even partially about Saddam Hussein: Like the part about also terrorist Gaddafi (Khadafi) of Libya quitting his nuclear bomb building project when he saw Saddam Hussein fall to US forces in 2003 and Gaddafi feared he (Gaddafi) may have have been taken down next. Book was revised in 2006
great read: I really enjoyed this book. It is a well written, quick read, that makes you proud of our military efforts overseas.
Interesting but meandering: The subject of Ms. Thomas' book, her decades at the White House, assures that this book will be interesting. I was, however, disappointed at the lack of organization; the book reads like a conversation with a person who keeps remembering things to throw in and that can be inordinately distracting. There are also a number of factual errors in the book, which I would have thought a careful editor would have found and corrected. I have read a great many books written by reporters (Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather, David Brinkley, Lesley Stahl, Sam Donaldson, Charles Kuralt) and this was the only time I found myself distracted by the lack of organization of the writing. In the end, I found the book interesting, but not well-written.
Straight-forward and insightful: As a big fan of Helen Thomas, I could hardly wait for this book to be published. My only regret is that she left so many telling details out. Of course, if she had included all that she had learned while covering eight presidents, the book would have been to heavy to even pick up. I loved this book and it should be required reading in every college communications course in this country.
Good Book: What an interesting lady she is..I really enjoyed this book. I am Australian and I found her story fascinating.I can only imagine that for anyone in America, it would be even better. It is good in the sense of reading it and I kept thinking, you think you know someone and then there is a lovely surprise at the end.Boy, she has guts!!! good on her I say.
"Mr. President?": If you've ever wondered about the woman who for years asked the first question at presidential news conferences and also ended each one, then this memoir will be entertaining. Thomas had a long career and got to know every president since JFK pretty well, or so you'd think from this book which is chock full of interesting anecdotes and opinions. It is a bit repetitious and would have benefited mightily from tighter editing. One wonders if the publisher was a little too reverential to use the red pencil. Somewhere along the line, UPI, her employer, lost a lot of its power and impact, due to business turmoil. Still, Thomas soldiered on. She doesn't say much about UPI in the memoir, probably because she's still working, though for Hearst. If you follow the journalism biz, you'll want to read this one.
The front row at the White House has a price.: I was disappointed that Helen Thomas managed to pen no less than 3 times in her book that former deputy White House counsel Vincent W. Foster had committed "suicide." Last October I had dinner with Helen Thomas at the National Press Club and handed her a copy of the addendum that was attached by the court to Ken Starr's report on Foster. The addendum was submitted by Patrick Knowlton the harassed and intimidated witness who is suing FBI agents and others for violating his civil rights. Helen Thomas remarked at the time, "this should be reported to the public." To this date not one member of the American press, including Helen Thomas has told the truth about the death of Vincent Foster and Patrick Knowlton's story is noticeably absent from her book.It would appear to sit in the front row at the White House as long as Helen Thomas you have to keep your mouth shut. This what we call award winning journalism? Her book was very disappointing to me.
Everthing you didn't want to know about Helen and very little about anything else: I was looking forward to reading this book but was sadly very disappointed. Helen Thomas takes great pains not to rock the boat. She is in a position to make intelligent insider analysises, but she chooses instead to sit on the fence. She seems tickled pink that various presidents noticed her! And her birthday!!!! Sheesh!
Ms. Thomas confirms how the media is stuck on themselves.: On page 139, Ms. Thomas chides former President Johnson for giving the Pop a "twelve-inch bust of himself" when the Pope gave Johnson "a fourteenth-century painting." I was looking for a fourteenth century painting in this book, but all I got was a twelve-inch bust of a self-absorbed (self-described) journalist. The Beltway has consumed another media-type. Save your money on this one.
Waste of a day: I never really enjoyed her work and this did nothing to change my opinion. Just another annoying liberal with a mediocre book.
Lively Reading: This book was a great read! As a long time UPI correspondent on the political stage, Helen Thomas has some stories to tell and she tells them well, in a positive and upbeat way. Yes, there was some 'jumping around' in the book - the events and antedotes Helen Thomas describes aren't written up in strict chronological order - but she can certainly turn an apt phrase and does so often in this book. I thought she portrayed the events and people in her life in a mature, insightful and entertaining way, without petty or grumbling judgements. She's upfront and proud of being a hard-eyed reporter out to get the facts - but notes in her book that quite a few of those individuals who fall under her scrutiny don't hold it against her. After reading this book, you'll know why.
Disappointing string of ancedotes without insights: One would think that after having been a reporter for decades, Ms. Thomas would be able to write. One would be wrong. She apparently doesn't know what the word "ironically" means, nor the word "quipped." She repeats ancedotes several times, even ones that weren't that great to begin with. She quotes presidents and first ladies complaining about the press, without seeming to realize that their arguments are often much stronger than her lame "freedom of the press" argument. Does the public REALLY need to know about Caroline Kennedy''s dead hamster? Does it REALLY matter what reporter called in a story seconds earlier than a competitor? And do we REALLY need to know about every award she ever won, every compliment she was ever paid? This book might have been much better if Ms. Thomas had retired first, and thought about her life's work with some perspective.
Gossipy and self-promoting; devoid of analytic insight: I found this disappointing, having hoped for genuine insight into the role and experience of the press and the White House. Instead it is crammed with random and often pointless anecdotes, in which the author's purpose seems more to assure the reader that her colleagues and those she covered valued her and paid attention to her. She portrays herself as a tough questionner, but this book can only make one wonder how effective a journalist she really was.
doesn't live up to the Corona name: I bought this ratcheting lopper expecting it to perform well given the Corona brand name, but it's a disappointment. The problem is that the ratcheting mechanism frequently does not kick in. I have used other larger ratcheting loppers before and even the cheap ones work better than this mini one. Here is what it does: The lopper makes a bite into a very thick branch and it doesn't have enough leverage to make the cut all the way through. This is perfectly normal for a ratcheting lopper. What is not normal is that when I open the lopper handles again, the ratchet frequently does not advance to the next step. The result is the leverage does not increase as it should and the lopper just gets stuck on a branch that it can't cut through. Sometimes it works, but often it doesn't.
a rip off: What a rip off, there is barely anything in these tiny vitamins! save your money, I can't believe I spent 20$ for nothing. These great reviews are obviously fake.
Staple in my Supplement Regime: Been taking this for abvout 2 months now and I seem to notice a difference. My 40 something eyes don't feel as dry and one day I noticed that I could read the news scroll on the bottom of the screen clearly! It also seems that I can read street signs better without having to strain.I take one every other day and have given up my bilberry/lutein supplement for this one; I think it is much better and a good addition to supplementation and to eye health.
Product didn't work!: I purchased this product for my dad who has been diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). He has very limited vision but noticed that his night vision had gotten gradually worse so I did some research and came across this product. It seemed like a really good product that provided a natural alternative to offer some relief for my dad's failing eyesight. He took the recommended dosage daily for the last month and did not notice any improvement in his night vision. I'm not sure if his condition hampered the effectiveness of this product but for what it states, I have to rate it a failure.
bad taste: The pills taste very bad when crushed and I have not been able to find the contents of each supplement anywhre. I dont know how much of anything I am taking. Also the information on the bottle is microscopic and very very hard to read. Since it is still hard to read I am guessing the pills are not working.
The Mastery of Hawthorne: The Reunion ReaperAs an English teacher at the high school level I cannot understand why so many of my colleagues do not care for Mr. Hawthorne's work. I would think that when someone gives Mr. Hawthorne due opportunity they will see the beauty and preciseness of his work. If you have not had the opportunity to read short stories that symbolize so much more than what lay in the contents of each story, I encourage you to delve into Twice Told Tales. Here you will discover a variety of work that taps into so many cavities of your psyche, not to mention discovering the experiences of a man who was obviously driven by man's seemingly natural inclination toward guilt and sin. Yes, there is a darkness and sadness to much of his work, but it is not morose or macabre like Poe. With Hawthorne humanity is in many ways, stripped away and we see, like in the "Minister's Black Veil", that we all hide behind a veil.
This audiocassette is NOT an unabridged version: On the Amazon page the Twice Told Tales audiocassette is called UNABRIDGED in capital letters (twice!), and the review states that Hawthorne's Twice Told Tales in book form contains 39 stories. Unfortunately, the Twice Told Tales audiocassette only includes ten stories on four cassettes. This is clearly NOT an unabridged recording of Hawthorne's Twice Told Tales.
A Sad Life: Is the saddest person the one who gets his deepest desire and finds it to be empty? JD craved an audience, and in the end, it cost him two wives. This is a sad book about an empty man who tried to fill his emptiness with drugs, booze, other woman, and about every weird cult that has every come down the bend. His shallowness is surprising. How ironic that a man marketed as such an all American boy was anything but.
Very interesting: A great book if you want to fully understand the music and songs ofthis great artist. Wish you were still here John!
It could have been better: Oddly enough I found myself owning two copies of this book. And while I read it cover to cover I wish it had more about JD:the man and his music and his feelings. It just didn't seem to cover enough of what I was looking for. Sherianna
Not enough of what we want to know: Having been a fan of John's music for over 20 years, I expected more from his autobiography, then what I got.It was interesting reading, and his honesty was refreshing; however, I was looking for more in depth writing on the various songs he had written.Few of them were written about it any detail.His second marriage to Cassandra Delaney was glossed over, in my opinion, as was his relationship with his children.I suppose it is hard to cram one's life into a 200 page book, but then again a marriage and children would seem to be more important than EST training.Still, overall, a decent read.I remain a fan of the man and his music. May he rest in peace.
Take Me Home : An Autobiography, John Denver: I got this book for my mother. I could not find it anywhere. My mother likes all of John Denver's songs and when she was in the hospital and sick, she wanted to listen to John Denver. So I got her his autobiography, found it on Amazon. She has thoroughly enjoyed the book. She wanted to know more how he came up with the type songs he sings and his background. Good book for anyone wanting to know about John Denver and his life.
It's a Keeper!: If you are a fan of John Denver's music, this is the best CD that he ever made! The audio-book is read by John Denver. It is very interesting to hear John talk about how "Annie's Song" was created while riding on a chairlift; how Bill and Taffy Danoff worked together with John making "Take Me Home, Country Roads", and how his long estangement from his Father was finally bridged with flying lessons. John talks about life on the road and the problems that he and Annie could never settle. He doesn't make excuses for his divorce from Annie or the chainsaw incident at his home in Colorado. John Denver just tells it like it happened.
This book is the foundation of modern bullying prevention!: This clear, brief, and practical book is based on extensive research and outlines an intervention to prevent bullying. Dr. Olweus's work has become the standard approach to bullying prevention, reflected in such programs as the University of Colorado "Blueprints for Violence Prevention" project ... As a counselor and trainer specializing in bullying prevention, I find this book indispensable, and recommend it highly.
ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER: Don't usually read screenplays but I saw the movie so many times (Susan Sarandon is my favorite actress, I like Harvey Keitel too) that I could picture it as I went along. A few scenes were changed in the movie but not many. The dialogue is laugh out loud funny. Darryl, Thelma's husband, is such a jerk, just as portrayed in the film version. Most of the characters are faithful to the screenplay. I love the symbolic ending-two women flying off...and leaving it all behind.
Not what it what it said it was.: I believe the claims to fit both a side post and top post battery are very misleading and inaccurate. Since I live out in the country, I bought this thinking I could install it without additional parts. As well, the fused link defeats the purpose of a battery disconnect. When I tried to install this on a side post battery there are in sufficient parts to complete the installation. There is no way to connect the cable to the other end of the switch. To use this I had to travel to town (I live 50 miles from town) and get nuts and bolts ($2.20) to get it to work. I you install the fused link, then you still get battery drain from the on-board electronics and within a short week (at least in a GMC pickup) the battery is dead. I do NOT recommend the purchase of this switch for a side post battery.
A pain to install, not designed for normal battery cables: It should be simple, disconnect old cable,put this on, and reattach cable.However, the terminal post for the cable is too small for normal battery cables. No amount of tighting the cable bolt will firm it up for a decent connection.I've tried two different kinds of these to install on two different cars, and both have the same problem.Now, I'm out to find some soft copper sheeting to make up for the difference.The switch itself seems quite solid and simple to use. If you're not concerned about the memory settings maintained by the jump line [this draws current too], get a cheaper one for $11.99.
Brittle Clamp: Product appears to be made of heavy metal however it is brittle when I attempted to tighten it so it would be secure on the post it broke in half at the bolt. Overall the product appears well made, however if you decide to purchase be extremely careful when securing it to the battery.
lasted 1 month: worked well at first, then the knob became hard to turn. eventually, I couldn't turn it at all. somehow I think the connections stuck together. Conclusion: it's a cheap part that doesn't last. will have to try something else.
A Cornerstone of Old Persian linguistics: Professor Kent's monumental book is still the most widely used work on old Persian. Although it is old (about fifty years old), it provides us with a complete overview of the inscriptions and their transliteration and transcriptions. In many cases, like the style of teaching the grammer, the need for a newer book is felt, something in the league of Nyberg's A Manual of Pahlavi. Still, a great buy, if you can find one!
VERY INTERESTING: This book by Flemming is interesting and well written. I like it because it is non-fiction and is a true story (unlike his Bond novels). A real Flemming fanatic will love this wonderful book. I rate it a 4 star book and a piece well done.
Paper airplane nut!: Our ten year old grandson thought he knew how to make every kind of paper airplane until we found this book for him. He has thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of making new designs, which really do fly nicely. We have even tried to fly them off the upstairs landing and out the front door!!!
This product is severely lacking: When I buy CD burning software, I don't expect much. If you want to edit something, you are going to buy editing software, so halfway attempts to add editing functionality are superfluous. The one thing I do expect is that it be able to burn a CD-Rom. This product has no ability to burn a CD-Rom unless YOU CREATE THE CD-ROM INSIDE PYRO!!! This means if you have an old ghost image, forget it. Download a linux iso, forget it. Do you have backups, lying around on your hard drive? Forget it.
Biggest piece of garbage I have seen: This software is of no use whatsoever when it comes to playing & listening to CD's as a simple listening tool. If you want to slap in a CD and burn a duplicate of it, it may be ok. But if want a 'jukebox' to listen to CD's etc., run the other direction. It is so bad I am going to eat the $40 cost and throw it in the garbage. I am serious, it is that bad.
Never got it to work: I had the same installation problems. THe program would install and I could open it, but nothing worked. I couldn't play any audio file. I just got the same error message that the file could not be opened. Emailing customer support gets very old. I tried to jump through the hoops but could never fix the problem. I'll likely give it to my sister for Christmas and hope she has better luck with it on her PC
Terrible waste of time: Shuts down in Windows XP, error report appeared 5 times. Each time I started to 'add' mp3s to project it froze and pretty much never worked again.GARBAGE!
VERY LAME: I am very unsatisfied with this program. I have many mp3 files, some a couple hours in length.This program only reconizes about fifty percent of them. This program is going in the garbage.
DOA: I bought this program three days ago, 7/12/2004. I just bought a brand new computer with XP, and a CDRW Drive, and a DVDRW drive came standard with the computer. PYRO 2004 keeps telling me my computer has no rewritable drives installed, so I go to the cakewalk website to download the new drivers list so it will recognize at least one of my drives, and still no sucess. The only way to get support for this product is through E-Mail. Three days and I'm still waiting. I will never buy a cakewalk product again. They use to be good with music programs.
XP upgrade?: This software is costly if you plan to just rip tracks for MP3 in or out.Cakewalk Pyro. First you will find that the Gearlang DLL file hasn't been up dated to run with XP multiuser windows software, which XP has been out on the market for years. The dll file library is not a shared library which means only one user can rip CD'S that user is the admin. of that computer; so everyone else will have access to the admin's personal files while using this program. Be aware of the limits of this software. If you really need the bells and whisles it might be a value to you? NOTE Gerland DLL. file 95/98/NT (NO) 2000 or XP update.
Might be good, but BIG installation problems: I bought this program after reading reviews of several products. Maybe it's the best thing since sliced bread, but I couldn't get it installed. I called and e-mailed Cakewalk's tech support, and after 5 tries I gave up. I have a new machine running Windows XP, and even though the program is supposed to be compatible, it isn't. I've since heard from several would-be users who have had similar problems. I don't know what to recommend instead of this program, but unless you're willing to pay a high price in frustration, get something else.
Didn't work: Installed, following directions precisely. Tried to rip one track from a CD. Didn't work. Tried 5 times. Went online to obtain driver updates. Tried same CD. Didn't work. Tried a second CD -- 5 more times. Same error message.Was there any quality assurance done on this project by Cakewalk? I am seriously disappointed. I want my software to work right out of the box. This piece of junk didn't even come with a manual. You open the box and it contains a CD and a piece of paper telling you to visit Cakewalk's website. Lame, lame, lame. I don't have time to track down solutions to problems that should have been caught by Cakewalk's QA dept. Shame on you, Cakewalk.
doesn't keep what it promises: when I saw the title I was sure it is exactly what I needed, some special tips and tricks, something that you can't find easily on the internet. But it was nothing more.The good thing is now I have some good ideas in a book and don't have to search every time online.
Great resource: If you've worked with PHP for a while, you probably already know some of the hacks in this book - I did. But it did give me several ideas and I definitely picked up some new tricks and tips from it, so it was worth the buy for me. I love the "hack" books - I always learn something new!
Don't buy this book!: Please don't buy this book - even not if you are a PHP beginner. The hacks in there are for beginners and even for them it's not worth buying the book.The samples are just wrong, have security issues and are known by everyone that has ever coded seriously.So save yourself some money and buy another book, but not this one... the first O'Reilly-book that's really bad.
Some good hacks, not a lot of PHP: The book has a lot of hacks, to be sure! And if the author presents a hack that EXACTLY fits your need, then the book is worth a read (not a buy). WAY too often, though, the 'hack' is "How to use some other, non-PHP product to get PHP to do what you want."The book is like bizarre combination of "Look what I can do!" and "Buy this book where I tell you, quickly and poorly, how to use someone else's product that really IS great!"The book is barely worth checking out at the library.
Sanding Stick,Medium: Does a good job while it lasts. But that is the problem They don't last long. For the price I rate these sticks very low. Will not buy again.
Ask Ol Bill is worth the price: Dylan's new song Ask Ol Bill is as good if not better than Things Have Changed...He sings in a John Wesley Harding style...limited but nonetheless clear throated that is easy on the ear..This song just chugs along with great images worthy of the best from Dylan..There are previously released Dylan songs on this cd plus songs from other artists...Warren Zevon's Werewolf..still a hoot, the two corny country songs I just don't like...But I did not see the movie so they may bring some appropriate comic relief to the script...??? If you are Dylan fan, you gotta get this cd just for Ask Ol Bill....
Important info left out!: I love Lonely Planet Guides and have used them for many trips in the past, but this book was certainly not complete. One example is the lack of info on marionette shows. It's one of the most popular things to do in Prague and this book only mentions marionettes once, in a short paragraph about the history of theater in Prague. No mention on the places to see a show or what to see. Also, I have never had a travel guide that didn't mention ANYTHING about the train station in the city!! This book did not even have one piece of info on the train stations or how to find them, how to travel from other cities to Prague or how to get to other places from Prague. We had planned to go to Vienna from Prague and had no idea where the train station was, how to get to it, or how to find a train schedule. Thankfully our hotel was able to fill us in on this info. I would NOT recommend using this book as your tour guide for Prague, it isn't thorough by any means.
Useless Maps: Recently purchased the 9th Edition and found the pullout maps to be useless. The text is printed in an incredibly small font. I purchased this book without seeing it first based on experience with past Lonely Planet books. Never again. Outside of the history of Prague, I found little useful about this city guide. I was better served with a map provided by the hotel and what information I could gather online. I am shifting to Frommer's.
Poorly organized: As far as descriptions of sights, restaurants tours, history, etc, the information was pretty accurate. But actually being in Prague and using the book to get around to different sights and restaurants was extremely difficult.Instead of having a chapter on a specific neighborhood with everything in that neighborhood, they have a chapter on neighborhoods, then shopping, then eating, then drinking, then entertainment, etc. Having to flip to the eating section, then flip back to the neighborhood section, then flip to the map to see where it was located was very time consuming and annoying.Another thing I didn't like was that the writing on the maps was much too small. I have perfect reading vision and could barely make out the street names and numbers.
Great travel guide: This will be my first time in Prague to study at university. This book has extensive information on the area with quick tips for foreigners. Although, I do wish that this book had more pictures. The map in the back is a must.
Detailed, Helpful: My only qualm is that it isn't in full color. I may be spoiled by the other travel book I recently bought (Fodor's Paris 2011 Full-Color).Between this book and the Moon Travel Guide I also have for Prague, I would definitely say this one is more helpful and has much more content.
You can count on it: The Lonely Planet series was recommended to me, and the guide to Prague was the first one I purchased. The recommendation was right on, the guide's reputation is well deserved. Everything I needed to know is included, the places and restaurants were exactly as described, and the maps and walking tours were easy to follow.
Love PacMan!: I wanted my grandson to have the good old 'Pac Man' game that I enjoyed when my kids were little. He is 11 and loves it in spite of the fact that he has everything else. I think the simplicity is a nice change of pace for him and his little sister can play with him. It's so nice to be able to just hook it up to the little TV we have here and not have to interfere with our big TV.
didn't work so great: I have a rocking chair that was hand made in Hungary and is fitted together - no nails in the entire chair. Over time, the place where the arms connect to the back has gotten incredibly creaky. So, I got this to quiet the creak, but it didn't really work. I followed the directions and even applied it 3 times, thinking maybe it was just an extra creaky chair. But, the swel-lock never did do a good enough job. I won't be buying this again.
Few purses, Many Vanity Bags: I have a large collection of vintage handbags which a local museum wanted to display, so I needed to establish values. This book was of no help as it is mostly vanity bags. I ordered this book because the other books listed for sale were too old to have current prices. I am still seeking a CURRENT book with prices to value my 100+ purses! Do not buy this book unless you want to learn more about vanity bags, as there is next to nothing about vintage (beaded or mesh) purses in this book!
Love the writing. Don't love the publication.: I love Harlan Ellison's writing. Haven't read him for years and wanted to reread some of his stuff. It seems as though the publisher simply cut and pasted the contents into a new format without regard to pagination and footnotes. At least one footnote (there may be more as I am still reading) appears in the middle of the page following the reference. It's just very sloppy publishing. And why isn't Harlan bitching about this?
Irreverent Genius: What can I say about the writings of Harlan Ellison that has not already been said, some of it in court, assuredly. Funny, insightful, irreverent, and powerful, his style shines through no more clearly than in this collection of his shorter works. From the deadpan imitation of Ellison's style by Stephen King in the introduction, to the nonfiction accounts of Ellison's failed attempts at creating a TV show and writing for the Walt Disney Company, this book will have you laughing, crying, and contemplating the meaning of life, as any great work of speculative fiction should.
Smooth skin with honey overtones: I love trying new bath products and this shower gel is one of my favorites. It lathers well and leaves the skin smooth with a delicate scent of honey.
Really pretty and cute !!!!!!!!!: I have the brown ones. They are cuter than any shoes I ever got. They have a high heel like women's shoes. I am only seven, and I like to wear high heels. Little girls will love them!Mom says, "They are very sturdy and well-made, as can be expected from Nine West. My daughter wears them to school and runs around all day in them. She says they are comfortable."
Bland: I like Agustin Lara's tunes, but the way Solis sings them they all sound the same. He employs vibrato on every note that's held long enough to use it on, and it sounds weak and wobbly. If you want to hear the real beauty of Lara's music, go to Placido Domingo's Bajo el Cielo Espanol.
Left a lot to be desired: Love GNR, would love alternative versions of their music but this is a wimpy attempt. And dont be snookered into buying both CDs -- they share a handful of the same songs. November Rain is the best of the bunch -- no duh -- it was already an orchestral piece. Very disappointed.
all original artist: track number 5 - sana bukas pa ang kahapon - was originally performed by KUH LEDESMA. on this cd it is printed performed by SHARON CUNETA. If you listen to this cd it is kuh ledesma singing to sana bukas pa ang kahapon, the original artist to this song. sorry guys somebody made an error on this custom cd.
Great book...a little racist...but great book: I have to use this book for my Spanish class and I love everything about it. Well, not everything...all except the sections on stereotypes. The audio for that section is kind of racist in what others think about not only Americans but Blacks in general, so that rubbed me the wrong way but other than that it was a great book to learn from.
The book is racist and Americentric: Overall the book is useful, but the part of estereotipos is very racist. Most parts of the book reflect American perspectives on issues, which is not surprising as it was written by Americans. I would not recommend the book unless you are American and/or racist.
As represented: I needed this book for class and it came brand new for a third of the price sold at the school. As for the quality of the text book I think it is poorly put together and difficult to learn from.
Great book!: Buying this book instead of the new edition of this title saved me over $50! The only downside is that it does not have the story "La Llorana" in it...other than that it is basically an exact replica of the new edition!
Good book at an awesome price: Thank you for the book. *_* I think that buying books at amazon is a smart idea it is helping me to save money in books and pay for college tuition.
doubly dissatisfied: Spanish is my major and I planned on keeping this book, therefore I wanted a book in 'like new condition.' When I received this book it was in terrible condition. It certainly was not what I ordered. I was very disappointed. To add insult to injury, when I tried to get either a refund or a book in better condition I was met with many obsticles and in the end was stuck with this book and another book in terrible condition. NOT COOL!!!
never again: The person did not respond to emails. It took way to long to receive the book. And if anyone else is thinking about doing business with this person I strongly suggest against it.
Horrible Digital Conversion!: This was a favorite movie when I was a child and was intrigued enough to buy it as a digital download...but...the conversion from film to digital is completely unacceptable. If owning is a must, rent first to see the low quality for yourself. If I could, I'd love to get my $5 back!! Disappointing to say the least.
Scratching post: My cat loves his new scratching post! He spends a considerable amount of time scratching and playing with it. My only complaint, the carpet on the post unravels quickly becuse Akil has very sharp claws! All in all, a good product, would purchase again!
Poor quality construction: This fell apart almost from the first moment one of our cats tried to scratch it. The post separated from the bottom, exposing a couple of long staples that were all that was used to attach it to the plastic coupling. I suppose you get what you pay for... I can probably glue it or put some staples in myself; but I was not expecting any assembly for this product.
Cats have ignored this scratching post...: I'm probably going to toss this scratching post. When I put it together I didn't care for the look of it. It was easy to put together, but the seems of the carpeting look pretty cheap. The final decision has been made by my two cats, neither of whom have scrached it even once. The seem to prefer the cardboard and jute scratchers but have used carpeted ones in the past. Something about this one just doesn't turn them on. I think I heard one of them tell the post, "It's not you, it's me." You know what that means.
Flexrake Deluxe Carpet Scratch Post: Carpet on the Flexrake was okay, the top have was fine, but that was all that came with it. There was no platform on which to place the post. I wish the company that makes this item would not show a platform in the ad, when there is no platform when the item arrives. I sent the first one back because I thought this was an oversight, but surprise! surprise! The second one arrived and it was only the post. What's up with that? Is it just me, or is this false advertising?
too big/too small: We use this headrest for their bouncy seats only. I don't use it in their car seats because the smaller part of the head rest only fit their heads for a few weeks and the bigger part is to big for them now.
Great Idea, But...: I got this for my Evenflo Travel System (Portabout 5) and it was not very good. It just looked way too bulky. The directions from the travel system say to use a rolled up receiving blanket for neck support. So, i think I will just try that or the baby Boppy.
Never used it.: It is not recommended that you use anything in your carseats that is not provided by the maker of the carseat, so this was a waste. If you need support buy a boppy neck support - much better!
This should be taken off the market.: This is a hazard. We were told by a certifed carseat person that it is a danger, it could slip behind the babys neck close off the babys' airway. It should be taken off the market.
Doesn't help her head: I am not rating this very highly because my daughter's head still flopped around quite a lot when I used it because babies' car seats have them sitting almost upright even as newborns. This didn't help her head from going side to side or even forward. Also, my car seat came with one.
Not Safe: This product is unsafe. yes to an untrained individual thinking of comfort for their infant, it looks much safer than a bobbing head during a crash, but if you actually watch an infant and an infant seat in a collision, the head does not bob from side to side. The baby moves with the impact, and with this headrest, the child is separated from the seat, resulting in a higher rate of injuries, including those to the neck and back. It may seem minimal, but it is significant! Aftermarket producers tell you they are safe, and why wouldn't they? They make money on it! a rolled up receiving blanket placed around an infants head, not behind it, is safe. THIS IS NOT. Who are you going to trust? A sales associate making commission on his sales, or a carseat inspector, trained to potentially save lives of a baby. They do not tell you to remove aftermarket products for their benefit. It is for the safety of the precious cargo depending on you!!
Think about using them in car seats...: In my childbirth class, the state car seat technician came in and explained to the class how to properly use infant car seats. She said that you shouldn't use any type of headrest that did not come with the car seat as it has not been tested and approved as safe. Instead, she recommended using rolled up receiving blankets on the sides of the baby to keep him/her from flopping over.
Didn't work right for me: I'm not sure why but it didn't work for me. My son's head still flopped around; it wasn't deep enough. I use the "wings" instead, they work great!
What crash testing means: If I could have used zero stars, I would have been more accurate.It's true that after market items like this HAVE NOT BEEN CRASH TESTED and are therefore NOT recommended for use with your car seat. The alternative IS to use rolled up towels or diapers AROUND your baby's head or body. NOT BEHIND. The problem with these headrests is that they add material behind the heads and bodies. This added material increases the distance your baby will travel during a crash. This isn't good. Your car seat wasn't tested with extra material. That's why they aren't recommended.
Not recommended by safety experts: These types of items that you buy separate from the car seat and add to it are called "aftermarket products" and are not recommended. Certified Child Passenger Safety Technicians state that these products have not been crash tested and may interfer with the way your car seat was designed to function. Anything that comes with a car seat has been crash tested with the seat. Anything you buy to add to the seat has not. Nothing should go behind the baby or around the harness straps of the car seat. A better alternative to protect floppy newborn heads is to take a thin receiving blanket, roll it up and bend it into an upside-down "U" shape and place it around the baby's head. It is also crucial that your infant seat is reclined at a 45 degree angle so the baby's head does not flop forward and cut off his/her airway. (...)
Not needed: I returned the headrest that I received at my baby shower. I found that the items I needed to use it with (the carseat, the stroller, the swing, etc.), came with their own headrest. Also, parents should know, that when I had my carseat checked by the sheriff department's trained carseat safety deputy, I was told NOT to use one of these in a carseat UNLESS the seat comes with one that is made to specially fit that seat. Using one in a seat that it wasn't made for can cause your child to fit improperly in the seat, putting them at greater risk for injury. The product may be a fine one, but I found an "extra" one to be unnecessary.
Not for carseats: Although the product description says it can be used in carseats, according to the NHTSA, anything that was not crash tested in your particular car seat compromises its ability to protect your child! If you really feel the need to have head support, roll some light receiving blankets and put them around the sides of the head. Nothing should be behind baby or between the front of baby and the straps. Some carriers and carseats do have supports included with them. They are considered safe as they were tested with the seat.I give this product 2 stars instead of 1 because it is great for use in swings and bouncers, especially for tiny babies.
Returned: These did not work well for my daughter. It would end up behind her head, keeping her head forward and straining her neck.
Great Quality Belt: Bando is not a well known belt brand in the midwest, but should be. High quality product made in the U.S. and at a great price. Normal delivery was very fast.
w: Not the movie I thought it was. OK for what it was. I would expect to find this on very late night TV
Great rooting gel: This is a great gel - it was referred to me by a true gardener who won't use anything else.
KILLS CUTTINGS - Don't buy from ALL STAR HYDRO INC: I saw such great reviews that I had to try this gel. I put it on some new and recent cuttings and it burned them badly. The cuttings started to die within 24 hours. I recut the cuttings, and they would not restart. The rooting chemical permanently damaged them and they would not restart. I threw them out.NOTE: I tried the gel on several kinds of plants and all were permanently burned after taking in the gel at the end of the cutting.Some of the cuttings grewmold at the tips.I wrote the company, ALL STAR HYDRO INC, about what happened and a refund. They never bothered to respond to me.DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY, it will KILL your cuttings.
"Clone Killer": This product killed all of my clones! I even tried diluting with water. Waste of money in my opinion! I'm open to suggestions if anyone else has had luck with this product, and then I may change my review.
Rootech kills clones: I tried several cuttings with rootech, killed every one every time. Plain water or cheap powder rooting hormone worked in almost every case. Maybe I got a bad jar of it, but after 3 rounds of 100 percent death, I'm throwing out my $30 jar of the junk.
Great Movie!: This movie was GGGGRRREEEEAAATTTT!!! Wow! What chemistry! This is a perfect example of true independent moviemaking, telling a non-Hollywood story. Four stars (out of 5)!!!
Okay but a bit slow: I found it a bit slow going and mild. Not much action at all, but if you are a fan of Dean Cain, you will like it. It is not predictable nor does it end the way you think it should.
Great Family Movie!: It was funny, romantic and entertaining. I love it and will watch it again! Great for the entire family, has no profanity or bad language which was a plus! Loved Dean Cain!!!
Its great!: I have been listening to the songs on the internet and i think its very calming and soothing. Even if it is in portuguese its just nice to listen to it even if its not understandable. I have seen the novela siete mujeres and the music is right from the novela. The music is very beautiful and its worth it. =)
love these movie collections: I found this at walmart in their $5 bin. Snatched it up immediately. Amazing set of movies and Actors/Actresses. As always some good lesson's involved.
Exactly what I wanted: Karen E. Goulekas has saved me quite some time with this book by providing a complete description for over 7,000 visual effects terms often referred to within the industry. In the past, I often had to search the net for certain terms and descriptions that had me baffled...but no more. For those of you who are considering buying this book, know that it isn't a book full of pictures (Although it does contain 32 pages of colour stills); It isn't a book detailing visual effects work in particular films; It is what is says - 'A comprehensive glossary of over 7,000 visual effects terms'. If this is what you're looking for, this book is for you.
get real!: Kingdom Come is something very special, that is something that must be said outright. Anyone who knows anything about Dobry knows that he also writes about the mob in the stock market. Why? I don't know. As good as he is writing fiction, I wonder what his fascination with the mob is. Calling Dobry a "pedophile" and a "homosexual" in a book review? A "pedophile"?? What book was this guy reading? I don't believe that review was serious. Say what you want about Kingdom Come, but to write a review claiming there is pedophilia in it, I have to wonder if that review itself wasn't written by a mobster, or if the reviewer himself just doesn't have some serious issues he has to deal with. The erotica in Kingdom Come, what little there is, is hetero-erotic consenting sex amongst adults.The imagery is dark and written masterfully. I highly recommend this book.
Great Writer Great painter: Gary Dobry is nothing short of a great writer and great painter. This book is a must read.
Gary Dobry Can Not Write!: It's clear from Dobry's art he uses a projector to produce what is on the canvas. When it comes to writing he can't do this. His writing is very trite and old hat. Don't waste your money. Dobry is neither Bukowski or Miller.
I Fell Asleep: I fell asleep trying to read this so called book. Think of the trees who died for what? Gary Dobry's vanity?
Kind of a Hack: Gary Dobry is certainly a boxer. He also seems to have a gift for convincing people that he writes on par with Bukowski or Miller, when the truth is that he pales in comparison. A visit to his website shows that he trained Danny Bonaduce for the 'Celebrity Boxing Match' show on Fox a while back. How can someone write about artistic integrity and living the 'Continental Lifestyle' while nonetheless perpetuating CELEBRITY BOXING? Don't be fooled by the pseudo-artistic posturing. The fact is, Dobry's writing reflects his lack of originality. This book is dry, boring, and unoriginal.
Dobry: I remember Dobry from the All-Elvis Art Show at the old World Tattoo Gallery in Chicago. I remember he was playing blues with Bumblee-Bee Bob back then. Seeing him on television brought back memories of the good old days. Good to see him still painting and ripping it up. It looks like he's still pumping-iron too! We used to think he was the bouncer until we saw him play.
You might want to reconsider: If you really want this book, spring for the Princeton Architectural Press larger format hardcoverfor this bargain edition the format is too small and the image quality is poorly reproduced.
Awesome: This CD is AWESOME! You won't find anything else like it. It's Raining Men is unbelieveable... he sings in at least an 5 octive range, and both of the weather girls' parts. It may very well be better than the original version. The cd has a great band backing him up and it has a live audience interaction to add to the party feel. Outstanding, outstanding, outstanding! And, barbie girl by aqua was banned in the usa, wasn't it? So you cant even find that song elsewhere maybe.
Swing and a Miss: I bought this album thinking it would be Klaus Nomi redux. Unfortunately, while Cordeiro has a lovely voice he hasn't the imagination of Nomi. These songs are done "straight up" (no pun intended) with no apparent hint of irony or subversiveness. It's entirely too bad... what could have been a camp extravaganza is just lame, warmed over disco.
Not for children: This book was suggested in a home-school catalog as a book to help my children understand the customs at the time of Jesus' birth. It is, plain and simple, a romance novel. Some of the more adult references were beyond my children, but I still found myself explaining things to my seven year old that I didn't want to explain to her until she was older. I enjoy a good love story, and so do my three pre-teen girls, but we were not interested in this love story as it was written.
PURE FICTION: This book is sweet, so long as you remember it is pure fiction. It is a poor representation of historical fiction, of which the title and subject matter give the impression of being. Historical facts about Judaism, about Israel, about the birth of Christ, etc., are poorly researched and presented as fact (for example, scholars agree that Jesus was probably born in May, not December, etc.). Enjoyable read, but not to be confused with factual events of history.
Love the book, not the delivery: This is a wonderful book to read at Christmas time AND while you are pregnant. I ordered 2 copies for my daughter-in-laws but it took a month to get here, so not in time for Christmas, so very disappointed in that.
Excellent read for the Christmas Season: This moving story of Mary and Joseph was an excellent way to get into the Christmas season. It makes the story come to life. I highly recommend it.
Beautiful love story: While of course this is a work of fiction and should not be taken as Gospel, it challenges the reader to see a side of Mary and Joseph beyond the Christmas images so often portrayed in nativity scenes. I think it is refreshing to see such a human, down to earth potrayal of the boy and girl who would become the mother and foster father of Jesus Christ.
Shed a new light...: My mom suggested I read this book after she found it at a church library book sale. She said she had read it when she was around my age (17) and loved it. I was skeptical but read it having nothing else to read. I was hooked by the first chapter! I've always viewed Mary and Joseph in a non-human way I guess...not that I believe they're deities or super-natural or anyway more "important" then everyone else...but I didn't think of them going through the same struggles of passion and desire and going through the wonders of falling in love, not have any idea of what was to happen. It spoke to me about true love and purity and holiness in a way I didn't expect. Definitely a great alternative to the romance novels we see today.
Bass Solos Deluxe: If you are a big fan of bass guitar solos, this is the CD for you. But, I am not a big fan of bass guitar solos, so I do not care for about half the songs. Much of it is bass solos with drums and some intermitent guitar or keyboard sounds. I made a CD from it of the songs that do not have extended bass solos; it is about 45 minutes long. I like funky jazz, but this was a disappointment to me.
Funky, greasy, sweaty, bass plus...: An outstanding ensemble. If you've ever seen Marcus, you're not reading the reviews because you are so excited that this came out and you've already bought this. I've been a fan for a couple of years but have had this disc for about a month (through 3 deuces). Try as I might, I cannot get this disc out of my car. Marcus was here in Pittsburgh last weekend and I was lucky enough to see the show twice.The supporting cast is great, especially Poogie Bell on drums and "Patches" Stewart on trumpet, who incidentally will have a disc out soon.Buy this, you will NOT be disappointed. I wish I could give it an extra star, it's truly THAT good.
Great cover!: With my first child we had a white cover on the changing pad. Big mistake! No matter how hard I tried I simply couldn't keep the stains out - not even with bleech which I hate to use! This pad is great because I can use it with a mild detergent and it leaves behind no stains (thanks to the dark color). We have three that we rotate and clean every couple days. These covers are extremely durable. I haven't had any problems with the fabric shrinking or fading. I can't believe they still look new. They seem really comfy for my kids, and I love the way it matches the decor. I am glad we decided to spend a few dollars more for a better product this time around! Hope this helps!
Disappointing: After its first washing, our cover began to come apart at the seams and was 4 inches too short for the changing pad. It is very poorly made. We returned it to the store and have decided to use waterproof crib pads on top of the changing pad instead. They work well, are soft on one side for baby's comfort, and are easy to clean.
Fits fine: I have the contoured changing pad and this cover fits fine. I wash it in warm water and throw it in the dryer and it works just fine.
Not a Good Choice: After only a few months of very limited use and washings, this changing pad cover has proved to be very disappointing. The terry cloth is unravelling all over the place! Also, I think it feels very stiff, not at all comfy.We still use ours, but we put it on inside out now to hide the places where the fabric has unravelled/'run'.
Falls Apart: I have two of these covers one in white and one in navy, and they both have problems. They do in fact shrink when you wash them, even in cold water. Mine also have the same problem with coming apart all around the elastic. We've only used them for about two months now....quite disappointing.
Disappointing: I was really disappointed with the quality of this changing pad cover. It ripped after only a couple washes (and I washed it in cold water and the low heat cycle in the dryer), and was prone to snagging and got strings hanging all over it. Simmons is generally a reputable company, so I was surprised that it didn't hold up well. My son is only a few weeks old, and I am already having to buy a new cover, but I certainly won't be purchasing this one again!
Make additional work for yourself!: Like many other reviews say, these covers will be ripped at the seams after one or two wash cycles. I don't personally mind that they fit snugly, b/c it creates almost a little sling above the concave changing pad. However, don't expect plush, thick terry cloth - this fabric is more like a cheap, old Holiday Inn towel. If you hold it up to the light, you can see through it. Consequently, it doesn't contain baby messes as the manufacturer claims. Besides, as soon as your baby messes on it (almost every day for my newborn), you have to launder it and put on a new one. I hate saying it, but the most convenient thing for us has been disposable "chucks", or underpads, purchased at CVS/Walgreens/Eckerd/Etc. We're not using them anymore, but I wish someone would develop a less wasteful changing pad that is that convenient.
Don't Waste Your Money: I thought it was very important to have a cover for my son's changing pad, but I quickly learned that it's much better to use waterproof utility pads that are easily changed when they get messy... and they will get messy. The utility pads are much less expensive and much more versatile.
Quite disappointed: The cover does make the changing pad more comfortable; however, my son never seemed to mind just the pad by itself. That's a very good thing, since we bought two of these pads and they were both constantly in the laundry since whenever ANYTHING gets on them, they need to be washed. We'd be lucky to get a full day of use out of one when my son was a newborn. And after about a month they had so many stains on them that would not come out, that I just tossed them. Don't waste your money.
A good cover overall: I bought the navy contoured changing pad cover and I love it. It has held up well in the wash and fits our contoured pad (from Toys R Us)with no problems. I only wish it had slits for the velcro straps on the pad to fit through so we could use them!
SHRINKS: What else can I add that hasn't already been said? I just wish I had read the reviews first. Before using it the first time I washed in cold water and dried on delicate. It is now too small to fit on the changing table (I had checked before I washed it to make sure it was the right size - obviously it shrunk.)
A Pain: Because I had a little boy, this changing pad was the target of many late night diaper change mishaps. So, we had to wash it frequently. It immediately looked ragged and old. I stopped using it and just laid a blanket on the changing pad that could be easily washed.
Cheap quality: I have two of these in navy blue - the color faded and they are both starting to come unraveled and my son is only 4 months old. I would not recommend these covers.
This is wated money: I purchased two of these for my changing pad. Not only did they stain immediately with urine, but they also shrunk so small after one wash that they ruin the changing pad by pulling it up. Don't waste your money
Great Value - quality!: I have used this for three years and it is still like new even after countless washings.
It fell apart after one wash!!: I washed this along with all of his other clothes and goodies to prepare for his arrival. When I went to fold it I realized that all along the elastic the fabric had holes in it. The thing fell apart after one wash!
Fine for Windows XP users, but NOT Vista: I have been using this CardScan for a while now with Windows XP and it has proved to do an adequate job. However I recently changed to the Vista operating system and the scanner stopped working so I went looking for an downloadable update on the company website but was unable find any. I contacted CardScan by email and they replied that they indeed had an upgrade available but that I would have to pay $80 (plus S&H) for it. All of the other hardware vendors for other products I use with my computer (Dymo LabelWriter, Neat Receipts, etc) either offered a free downloadable Vista update or an update for a reasonable charge. Because of this I did not purchase the way overpriced CardScan upgrade and can now only give this otherwise good product two stars. I will not be purchasing another CardScan product in the future.
Cardscan is a good product!: Shipped fast and I had no problem installing the product via USB plug-n-pray. Works great! Did 200+ business cards from a trade show in about 20 minutes.
Didn't work out well at all.: I bought this product because I have heard some good things about it's durability. Unfortunately, it did not turn out that way for me. It chips easily, and when I tried to sand it to smooth it out more chips kept coming off. A good drop and huge chunks came off. Maybe I did something wrong, not sure how since all I thought I needed to do was add water at the right ratio and make the project. I wouldn't be able to recommend this product to anyone. Maybe I can add it to some other paper mache mixture I make that might actually work.
Terrible quality: BEWARE. This is of the quality you find on Dollar Store watches . Additionally for a childs watch it sure doesn't have enough holes on the strap to put on my 6 year olds wrist. Buy elsewhere.
The BEST book ever for children!: When I was 10 years old I read and re-read The Trolley Car Family at least 100 times (without exaggerating!) I have loved it all these years and now am reading it to grandchildren!
childhood: This book was the first book to get me into reading when I was very young. This hardcover copy in particular. I loved the way the book felt and I loved the story and it will always be one of my favorites
Femmes De Pais v 2: Very good product. It brings back the memories of when my family was stationed in Europe in the 1960's. I also have volume one.
Great book!: This book is very interesting. It has taken a very difficult concept (figure drawing) and broken it down into easy to understand step by step directions. The author's costume sketches were very helpful as well.
Another good book....: This is a fast read about political powers and want-be powers. I love the feisty heroine, Kate Boothe, as she and Jack solve the murder of her new boss.This is my second book by Michele Mitchell the other THE LATEST BOMBSHELL....and fast contemporary read that you can't put down till the last page.
Excellent workbook for all kinds of Introverts: An excellent, well presented, and thorough Workbook that contains self-tests to determine whether you're a Highly Sensitive Person, and if so, which kind: introverted, creative, sociable, worried, and/or "other plausible categories." I agree that this Workbook can stand alone, but also that it is better to use it with one of Dr. Aron's HSP books or related books such as The Introvert Advantage, or The Positive Power of 0 Thinking, or Undoing Depression, etc. -- depending on what kind of intovert you are and what you are trying to work on right now. I recommend the Workbook format because it is an active approach to self-understanding and improvement.
The Highly Sensitive Person's Workbook: I can't express how fortunate I am to have finally found material that can guide me forward in a truly connected way. Written from one Highly Sensitive Person to others, each activity has a personal resonance for those who have struggled to value their sensitivity and find their niche in the world. I hope to have all of Dr. Aron's books in my "library" one day, to read, re-read and share, yet find "The Highly Sensitive Person's Workbook" especially helpful for those looking for a more hands-on experience of writing down a lifetime of trial and error, and transforming it into renewed hope each day and a much greater sense of self-worth and purpose.
Didn't care for this book.: There were some intelligent points, but a lot of the ideas were rather silly. The reading is also boring. Wouldn't recommend.
Not really helpful...: I'm a highly sensitive person, and in today's world, it can be a handicap -- whether at the workplace or in relationships. This book, and it's companion, the Highly Sensitive Person -- validates what you're feeling or what you go through in life as a "HSP" (or, let's be honest - BPD sufferer) -- but it doesn't give you any real, helpful tools to try to overcome your sensitivity.I would be apt to recommend any type of DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) book, or even books like Byron Katie's "Loving What Is" or "I Need Your Love -- Is That True?" over this.
Learned helplessness repackaged as coping skills: The highly sensitive person, a creature undefined in this text and rooted nowhere in the realms of psychology or sociology, deserves much better than being pandered to and infantilized. Rather than teach coping mechanisms and skills for interpreting interpersonal communication, Aron's advice encourages narcissistic behavior and serves to convince the reader that they are fundamentally different from others in an undefined way, incapable of functioning on a basic social level, and rudderless without her help.The section on relationships, which advocates arguing by dodging valid questions, should be particularly ignored.I never leave 0 reviews on this site, but I feel I should warn prospective buyers. Avoid this book.
Champion Irrigation Actuator Rebuild Kit: This is a great product that can be used to renew a sluggish irrigation sprinkler valve actuator. At a low cost, a lot of money can be saved. I bought eight and just finished rebuilding one valve actuator. It works beautifully. The one item of concern is that the new diaphragm is simply a flat piece of rubbery material, instead of having a circular bellow for expansion, as the old one did. This means that the diaphragm may want to stretch as the valve opens. How would this affect the life of the diaphragm? I don't know yet. The only other 0 feature is that the kit does not include a bleeder valve screw, an item that commonly gets messed up. Just the O-ring for the bleeder is included.
Don't Go Away, It's Time To Play.. Guess The Model Number!!!!!!: Hey, here's a concept. How about ACTUALLY LISTING THE VALVE MODEL NUMBERS THIS KIT IS FOR????? I know that's kind of a radical idea to ACTUALLY TELL THE CUSTOMER SOMETHING ABOUT A PRODUCT AND HOW IT CAN BE USED, but I guess that's just the wild and crazy guy that I am.
accutron watch: I was very disappointed with the look and style of the product for the price, I felt the watch looked too big and boxy. It made the watch look cheap. I can't criticize the quality of the workings of the watch as we never took it out of the box once we saw it. I returned it immediately. I guess I did'nt see that from the picture. I have since found a competitors product at about the same price range that I felt looked a lot better.
Macroeconomics: This book was supposed to have been received by the end of January. It was ordered approx Jan 4. As of Feb 7, it has not been received. It has been requested the book be returned. There has been no communication with this seller.
Living the Lessons: Fr. Bodo has been so interested in St. Francis for so many years that his depth of understanding is thought-provoking and often startling. Every chapter has some dimension of Francis, the contemplative life, and the lessons of Francescan living that are informative to me personally and important to me Spiritually. This is a book that I will re-read a number of times to try to absorb as many of the ideas as my mind will permit. I am most thankful to have discovered this gem written about one of the most important mystics of all history.
Simple Yet Profound: When I was directed to the Prayer of St. Francis by a friend, I purchased this book to discover more of the spiritual beliefs that this man lived by. Interwoven into the narrative about the historical aspects of the life of St. Francis of Assisi are the spiritual convictions that led this man away from a life of wealth into a life of service and devotion to God. The chapters are brief, yet they are laden with depth, wisdom and selfless spirituality. I particularly found the chapters on prayer to be intensely profound, helpful and also practical. This book is not written as a "how to manual" on living a God-centered life. What it does is, it sets St. Francis as a role model, an example of living a spiritual life, and it is up to the reader to discover how to follow through with those examples in their own lives.
Horrible: This didn't work for us at all. First, I think there's a good chance that the product I received is broken. The plunger sticks and is very hard to move even a little bit. Once I finally got it to move to put the pill in, it didn't pop the pill out when I depressed the plunger. The second problem is that the tip is the wrong size for two out of three different pills my cat has to take. The largest is to big, and the smallest is too small. One pill fit, but as I mentioned before, once I placed it in the tip, I couldn't get the piller to pop it out (the rod was too short to push the pill out). This item was an epic fail for me, and its now in the trash. I suggest trying another style of pet piller (even though they're more expensive, the right one really can help!)
Missled!!!!!!: I was expecting a Unicel C-7656 Replacement Filter Cartridge (which replaces the Hayward CX500RE). Instead I received a no-name product which replaces the replacement filter ... I am not happy at all!!!! I already have the Unicel C-7656 filter, which works just fine .... I do not know if the no-name filter is OK or not, but I have used other filters which have NOT performed acceptably.
Did not have the gasket as shown in the picture!!: I bought this as a direct replacement for an older Unicel cartridge but it DID NOT have the gasket as shown in the pictures and mentioned in the description. I contacted Amazaon and was sent a replacement pair which did not have the gasket either so I ended up contacting the Unicel direct to see what the deal was. The sales person that I spoke to said that the product had been changed about 8 years ago and no longer has the gasket attached. For some reason it would not build the correct pressure when installed in the filter so I ended up selling and getting a new DE filter for my pool...
So Far Working Fine: Bought these to replace my existing cartridges that lasted nearly 5 years (alternating between 2 sets). These look just like the OEM Hayward ones and I see the same pressure loss (virtually none as I grossly oversized my filter). So far so good. Fast delivery and cheap shipping is hard to beat.
A Book That Begs To Be Shared: If you love words, their meanings, their sounds, and unexpected usage this book calls out to you. It is filled with Bible stories that are written according to the way that a young African lad would sound telling the stories in a mixture of his own language combined with the new language he is just learning, English. Read silently, you will discover immediately that it is pleading to be read aloud. Read it to children or adults, or a mixture thereof. When I discovered this unique book I had great success reading it to a large group of men, women, and children. They were entranced, mesmerized as they listened attentively. The applause at the end of my sharing was tremendous! Discover, too, individual stories in this book which were originally published as picture books. You will find so many uses for all of these books if only you will read one aloud -- just once!
Great Chill Jazz Gutar Album: The first I heard of Jon Dalton was his track "The Gift" on a net radio station, I was bowled over by his stunning, gentle jazz guitar playing and the tight R&B style beats. I bought "This Is Smooth Jazz The Box Set" which featured the track and then this CD. The Gift is still my favorite track and I play it over and over. There are lots of other subtle grooves all laid over with faultless guitar work. If you like Chris Botti's latest work and chill jazz like Praful this is the kind of CD you'll really enjoy.Together with those other names Dalton represents the new wave of smooth jazz music.
Not my choice: I am using this book right now as I go through college Technical Mathmatics for the first time. UGH! It is not good. Far too few examples and explainations. It does a 'fly-over' on the nitty-gritty.We have only covered a few chapters so far. It was the mandated book for this college course. But what little I have read, if this was a book I had bought for myself, I would have already decided to sell this one and get a different one.I will be updating my review as I go through this course, but so far this book blows!
Excellent: Excellent product. Saved $127.00 off the retail value of the book in Canada.Rec'd the book 7 days after the order. Thanks for the savings.
THIS BOOK "STAYS" WITH YOU FOR A LONG TIME.: Several friends recommended this book to me as being really good. So, of course, I bought it. I was not disappointed at all!! I loved everything it offered: action, great characters, sensuality, and sexy love scenes. I could not put it down,and had it read in 3 days. I wanted more of Jake and Victoria...wish there could be a sequel! Don't miss reading this awesome book!! And tell your friends about it!
A Lady of the West: I always enjoy Linda Howard's books. A Lady of the West was one of favorite books and I am saving it on my Kindle.
Didn't work for me...: Every other book that I have read by this author I have really enjoyed, but not this one. This wasn't about love, but force. These were not characters that are larger than life, but smaller than the average joe.
Wonderful! Very romantic.: I absolutely loved this book! Its only the 2nd Linda Howard book I've read and now I want to read all of them! This book has strong characters and a great plot. I didn't want it to end, I wish all books could be this good!
Kindle needs to proofread: So sad that such a good book was not edited or proofread when converted to Kindle. It is full of typos and garbled sentences that were not in the printed version. Amazon should take responsibility and send out a better edited version to those of us who have purchased this book.
Disturbing: The first Linda Howard book I read was All The Queen's Men, and since then I have read almost all of her earlier and later work. She writes sensual stories, erotic, passionate, usually great character development. I was disturbed by this book in many ways that I haven't been in reading some of her other work. This hero is abusive, emotionally and physically to the heroine and that I just cannot abide. Many of her characters from other books are certainly flawed, like most real people are, but this I just couldn't take and I couldn't finish it.
Soooo disappointing: If this was the first Linda Howard book I ever read, I would not have read another. If forced and abusive sex turns you on, this is the book for you. I read it to the end to give it a chance, but was completely disappointed.
Not Howard's usual.....: I love Linda Howard. However, this was the first book I have read where her lead man, Jake, fell short. This book reminded me of a Diana Palmer read, which often includes rough and abusive *heros*. I took issue with the physical abuse, which included slapping a pregnant woman and knocking her over, forcing sexual situations and emotional battering that went on throughout the book. I am a big fan of Cry No More and Kiss Me While I Sleep - this book was not of the same type.
No more violence please: I am a avid fan of Linda Howard. As an author she has consistently given me many, many hours of reading pleasure. I'm usually the first to line up to grab her next release, and constantly search for any previous books I have missed before finding her. I can't tell you how many times I have re-read her work. However... I was greatly disappointed and disgusted when reading this book. I DO NOT approve of violence directed toward women, even in fiction. I don't understand how a woman can fall in love with a man who demonstrates violence toward her. I certainly DON'T want to read about it. No more please.. I would not like to waste my money in this way again.
NASTY!: I love Linda Howard normally, but in this case I would recommend that you steer clear of this book, as it might well turn you off her forever. I would have given it less than one star if I could. To cut a long story short, this book contains scenes of rape and domestic violence, which I found deeply offensive and disturbing - especially since these crimes were committed by the so-called hero! At one point the hero seriously contemplates murdering the heroine in order to gain control of his family ranch. Instead he marries her, and proceeds to make her life misery. I know some women think that, in a historical context, such things are okay, and if that's your opinion, fine. However, most Linda Howard fans love the tenderness and protectiveness displayed by her heroes, and there isn't ANY in this book.
Have read better...: I have recently developed a serious crush for Linda Howard books, but this one was rather disappointing. My overall impression was that it all seemed very barbaric. All male characters treat women like possessions and the hero is no different. I refuse to go with the idea that sex, no matter how great, solves all problems and heals all wounds. The tragic events were sad, but very flat, and the book ended without a proper heart-to-heart conversation between the two main characters. Realistic maybe, but not what I wanted.
A BIG Mistake >_<: I've enjoyed lots of Linda Howard's books, but I must say that there are quite a few that left me disappointed. A common problem being, the hero gets away too easily after treating his lady shabbily. I was thoroughly disgusted by the hero in this book. He actually slapped her so hard, she slammed into the wall!! Gosh.... and he got away with it later, as if it was just a petty quarrel over who's to do the dishes! For a great story, try Son of the Morning or Midnight Rainbow. There are many other great stories from Ms Howard, but I enjoyed these 2 the most! ^_^
It was definitely not one of Linda's best: I have read many books of Linda Howard and I must say I was rather disappointed with this one.
This is a very exciting book and the romance really sizzles.: I really enjoyed this Howard book. The story moves and the characters crackle with emotion. I had trouble putting it down. The lady in the story is delicate and strong with a backbone to match the hero, who happens to be very much larger in size than she. I love ladies who can meet the challenge of a strong man and make him see the error of his ways. That happens in this book, he is laid low and I applaude her for introducing us to another heroine who will not lie down and be walked over. Bravo Linda!
It stinks: The temple on the picture is Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, located in Mtskheta, Georgia, and has nothing to do with Armenia. I've got no doubt this is not a mistake, but quite a conscious falsification. This is an ultimate manifestation of an inferiority complex. One can only despise it, no need to argue and no need in trying to explain anything. That just sucks and is as queasily as it is.
False: The pircture on the first page of CD is the Cathedral Church (Sveti Tskhoveli) of Georgia. Why Armenians are trying to sell it as their own? Please be carefull they had stollen the picture. There is big chance that the songs aren't Armenians as well.
Old Trick: I express my outrage at this shameless manifestation of typical old 'trick' Armenians pursue in regards of Georgian cultural heritage.Having plentry of their own architectural monuments there was no obvious need to 'steal' Svetitskhoveli cathedral's photo and put it on cover of Armenian song's CD.
Beware!!!!!!!: Well, well, well... once again, like someone else put in his review, Armenians are stealing Georgian heritage. Perhaps they do not have as monumental and beautiful church as this Svetitskhoveli Cathedral is (I've never seen Armenian churches and have no opinion about them), but why should they steal one from Georgia and put on their CD? I smell something fishy here. And who knows what songs are on this CD? Can church-stealers be trusted????????? BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!
falsification: And why am not I surprised about one more fact of Armenians trying to present Georgian cultural Heritage as their own one?! The monastery on the CD image is Georgian, located in Mtskheta near Tbilisi.
Customer misleading: Dear Amazon, the item you are selling through your respective site is misinforming the customers. The cover of this CD shows one of the most important and oldest cathedrals of 11th century in Georgia (Republic of Georgia) and it has nothing to do with Armenia.
good songs, nice voice: I liked this CD, specially since I heard Rosy Armen on recording of 1970's. She has a very interesting French-Armenian image, which is visible through her songs. Those of you who know her songs will enjoy hearing her again with this Armenian songs selection. Good!
ICP will never die no matter how hard you try: As the juggalos know, this song is on the psychopathics from outer space but this single is still fresh. I'd like to tell the other reviewer that dogged on icp to watch his mouth before the revolution of the juggalos of all nations form together and annihilate his punk ass
Tilt a whirls and bumper cars are fun...: This is the Pendulum featuring the track " the amazing maze ", which is the best of the Pendulum's Ive heard. I own 1,2,3,4, and 12.
How many albums? Where are the hits?: ICP needs to stop trying to use Eminem to sell records. They're just going farther in their hole they came out of. The spoof song "Slim Anus" was the worst thing they could have done. I recommend not buying any of their albums.
Why The Rest Hates The West: Very timely, very frightening, and very poorly written. A difficult read. Meic Pearse is like the speaker who likes to hear himself, but substitutes the written word - a lot of them, with a lot of syllables, and vague meaning.The subject matter is too important to be presented in such an obtuse and confusing treatise, but worth the struggle.
A great science and technology reader by Safari Magazine: A wonderful book that compiled facts about Antarctica, mountain biking, and garbage. The book covers the types of Antarctic ice, Antarctic wildlife, population of Antarctica, McMurdo station, parts of a mountain bike, snow mountain biking, mountain biking saftey gear, olympic mountain bike racing, household garbage, life cycle of recycled items, modern landfills, and much more.
More about pop Americana than the TV series: I thought this book would be an in-depth look at LinS and its times. It is actually more about the late 50's to mid-Sixties US. It had a few nice photos but spent more time on the Moon and Mars Landings and the Cold War than it did on the Space Family Robinson. I was tremendously disappointed. Also, it could have been edited a bit better...many quotes are used as chapter headings and as photo captions and then often in the middle of the text as well! It looks real nice but is not worth the money. The best part of the book was the two-page interviews with most of the actors telling us what they have been up to since the end of the series. Don't buy this unless you are a real LinS fanatic. For great photos of the classic series I recommend the LinS Arcade Series Entertainment Utility CD from Sound Source Interactive instead.
A book that discuses Lost in Space, as well as pop culture: Lost in Lost in Space is an exellent book. It not only talks about Lost in Space, but also about sixties pop culture. I reccomend this book for fans of Lost in Space.
Leslie Charteris is turning in his grave.: I have been a big fan of the "Saint" for years. I purchased the book hoping to recapture some of the spirit of adventure and cockieness of the "Saint". I had hoped to experience his unsaintly actions outwitting the criminals and thugs he exposed and turned the tables on in the original stories. "Captured the Saint" was an extreme disappointment for me and I am sure his true fans will also be terribly disappointed. Where was his bodyguard? Where was his long time girl friend? Sorry, this was totally disappointing for me.Larry in N.C.
AWESOME printer for College student: I bought this printer to print papers and things for school. It's fantastic! It prints like no other, it sits under my desk and takes whatever I throw at it. It prints all my papers and my friends papers, and it NEVER runs out of ink. I red somewhere that it gets 12,000 pages per toner and the toner is really cheap! I'll add an amazon link in a bit!Josh
Uh-oh - it's broken: i ordered the "people usually buy" items package: swirl chocolate seashells, pearl seasheels and starfish - 2 out ofthe 3 look wonderful - however, the largest item and the one to be used on the bridal shower cake - the large starfish arrived broken. not sure if seller will replace.
riptide: Your memories are always better than the second time around. I thought I like this series when it was on T.V.It's just so dated and not in a good way, but in a very BAD way. It just all noise and the goofy nerd whose just awful with his inventions and his demeanor.
YOU WILL NOT GET THE REBATE: I PURCHASED THE X VERSION AND I AM STILL WAITING FOR THE REBATE. THE REBATE SITE SAYS MY REQUEST IS 'IN PROCESSING'. IT HAS BEEN THERE FOR MONTHS. I ALSO PURCHASED VERISON IX AND IT WAS BETTER THAN THE X VERSION. BUT CROOKS ARE CROOKS, SO BUYER BEWARE.
Very disappointed: As a long time Paint Shop Pro user I was excited to see that a new version had appeared. However I consistantly get messages that the program is not responding. Save your money and continue to use your older version. That's what I'm doing except that I already wasted my money on Verison XI.
Cash Back Problems: I bought an earlier version, Pro X, last year. Supposedly I was going to get some cash back and I gathered all the info Corel asked for on the offer and mailed it off. The money never came.I hate it when software like this is advertised at a lower price with "$30 cash back" on the box. In my experience, many companies simply never send that money back. Corel is one of those companies.
Corel ruined Paint Shop Pro: Congrats, Corel. You've taken a wonderful and useful graphics program and reduced it to a nagging, agonizingly slow, bloated piece of trash. I've been using it since it was shareware and each version got better and better. That is until Corel entered the picture. I have uninstalled V9, V10, and V11 and gone back to V8. Save your money and try to find an old version.
Worst version yet: I've been a longtime user of paint shop pro since its shareware days. It was always a favorite and I have paid to upgrade several times. This time I moved from version 9 to version 11, so it is the first version I've tried since Corel bought Jasc. Boy, what a piece of garbage this software has become. I've got a fast computer with 3 GB of RAM and it takes about 1 minute to start up and consistently uses 25-40% of my CPU even when it isn't doing anything!The current user interface is very hard to get used to. I've been using this software for years and still can't figure out how to use this latest version.To top it off, my rebates were rejected for reasons unknown. It took me resubmitting them with a threat to contact the BBB to get one, and then finally a phone call to get the other one.I now mostly use Adobe Fireworks or the old version of Paint Shop Pro, and I would highly recommend that people NOT buy this product!
Many, many problems: I've been a loyal Paint Shop Pro user since version 3. I've used it on major commercial design projects, right alongside Photoshop on my Mac and Gimp on my Linux box. Sadly, version XI is one of the poorest software builds of any product I have ever seen. It locks up, won't start, won't close, takes forever to load, and has issues with many fundamental functions such as JPEG formats, loading/saving files, cache management, and thumbnail generation! Really, it is just unbelievably bad. Worse, when it crashes, although you can kill it from Windows Task Manager, it will immediately crash if you try to launch it again -- you'll have to reboot your computer to get it to work. Moreover, it is painfully slow, even on my fast Intel Core 2 Duo box with dual-channel memory and SATA drives. My advice to users is to stick with Version 9.
Not for me: Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo XI: I bought a full retail copy of Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo XI and don't like it at all - I've probably spent 5 hrs. now trying to learn to use it with little luck. The tutorial CD won't play in my new MS Vista laptop. The manual is of little use. The help with the program is just like the manual - of little use.I've been using the software that came with an old Sony Mavica camera I bought several years back - it wouldn't load on my new laptop, so I bought PSP - I am really disappointed in it. It might be capable of doing great things, but I don't know how you would ever learn to do them!!I'm going to discard this useless program and buy Photo Shop Elements 5 - I feel Corel cheated me on this program!!
Easy to use: I ordered this product as a result of a recommendation from a nationally known artist, who uses this software to assist her in composing ideas for her paintings. One of the features I most appreciate is the ability to straighten out pictures that were taken at an odd angle. The software is very easy to use and intuitive. I would recommend it.
Not very Vista compatible: I have used PSP for over 10 years now. Vista + PSP is a disaster. It will crash for no reason (not performing ANY operations). At this point, I will probably uninstall and install version 9 (and turn on XP compatibility).
Worth the money!: I own both PSP XI and Adobe Photoshop CS. I paid 700.00 for Adobe and about 80.00 for PSP XI. I really like PSP for editing my photos and creating slides. It has a lot a great features that are MUCH easier and faster to perform in PSP than they are in Adobe PS. It is a little buggy in that it does shut itself down every now and then, but it opens right back up. I am a software application manager and developer and I can tell you NO software comes without bugs. The ones I have found here are not enough to keep me from loving this program.For the money, it is a great buy. I am sure Corel will have a patch for the shut down problem soon, as long as users report the problem.Bottom Line: If you wnat an affordable solution to edit and create fun and beautiful photos and slide shows, this product does very well!
No better than previous versions: I upgraded to version XI when I read a review that said it would open Nikon D200 RAW (.NEF) files. I hoped that it would open my .NEF files from a Nikon D80 and Kodak Raw (.KDC) files from a Kodak P880 Camera. Both the Nikon and the Kodak RAW file formats are in the "Open" Dialog, but opening a .NEF file yields an "unsupported file" error. Attempting to open a .KDC file yields a "missing parameter" error. An email to customer support asking if these formats should or would be supported got me an email response that was totally unrelated to my question.XI takes a long time to load, the browser window changed to something unusable a couple versions ago, and I have not discovered any significant new features.I've used Paint Shop Pro since it was shareware. My recommendation would be to stick with older versions of Paint Shop Pro; preferably one from before Corel bought Paint Shop Pro from JASC.
Easy enough for my 11 year old daughter to use for school projects: My 11 year old needed to clip images from the web and modify them and paste them together for a school project. We downloaded PSPP 11 for the 30 day trial, and I completely left her alone to figure it out. She was up and running without any help literally in minutes and loving the ease of use of this product. The end result was astoundingly professional. I was completely surprised, and proud of her creativity.Now she wants a permanent copy of PSPP 11 for Christmas, so she can clean up digital photos and add them to her web pages and blogs (she's really into it).Thanks, Corel for a product that's easy to use, fully featured, and affordable.
Packed with features and user friendly too: Before purchasing this product I did the trial of Photoshop for 30 days and then the trial of this one. Paint Shop Pro (PSP) won hands down! While they both have similar features, the learning curve on Photoshop is ridiculous...PSP is so intuitive, you can figure out most of the features on your won, but the help feature is great...side by side help as you click through the menus and buttons. I was impressed! The red-eye fix is excellent and flexible, with ability to change to pet eye, different eye colors, WOW, there is just so much and all ready to use out of the box without any complicated aftermarket manuals needed. I have restored some antique photos with very impressive results. So far I have not had the instability issues that others cite, but my PC is heavy on the graphics capability and memory, perhaps that helps.
Great Product: This is great product for beginners and advanced persons. The features are nice and easy to use. Some of the special effects on it take a little time to learn to use.
Great photo editing: Great product. I would rate it higher but I am disappointed with the documentation/users manual. It can be difficult to learn on your own.
Make sure this supports your camera's RAW images: I bought the software ( Jasc Paint Shop Pro 9 ) before I bought my camera - to be ready to process the pictures I was going to take.A BIG MISTAKE.I bought a Canon 30D camera and record my images in RAW format (*.CR2).UNFORTUNATELY, not all Canon .CR2 RAW files are the same. So, even though the software says you can edit .CR2 RAW images, it depends on which Canon camera made the image. So far, there have been no update patches or upgrades to make the RAW images from my 30D useable by this package.
Leave it to Corel: to mess up JASC's genius.Paint Shop Pro was a great imaging program until screwed with by Corel. I recommend buying the older JASC versions. This one is a brutal unfriendly mess.
Amazing for the price: This is an amazing program for the money. Almost as good as Photoshop at a fraction of the price. I'm running it on a Windows 8 64 bit system (the Final Preview version) and it is fast and rock solid. No crashes. This program is not 64 bit but runs on a 64 bit system in 32 bit mode.Perfect for beginners with all of its filters and effects. Can auto clean up all kinds of damaged or noisy photos. It has layers with transparency and raster or vector styles. Layers can be merged, and changed position in the queue. Saves to almost any format, imports everything.For $10?Very nice.
Transaction: This transaction was excellent. I received what I ordered, in good condition, and speedilyu
Hold On Before Purchase: Like other reviewers here, I, too, recommend stopping at version 8. Above that, I've encountered glitches that drive me nuts. For example, with ver.9 and up, I often encounter dialogue boxes telling me my system is short of memory and cannot perform tasks at hand. The 1st time this happened, I had 3.5Gbs system memory. On a new computer, I had 4 GB and still encountered the problem. On my latest system, I have 8 GB system memory and I am still being stopped in my tracks for "lack of system memory". There are freezes, too, and, as others noted here, PSP X, XI up are painfully slow to work with. I really hated to say goodbye to PSP but it is no longer what it was when JASC owned the company.
Not what I was expecting: I must admit I am a novice in respect to digital photography but this program is a little too complicated for me (more than I can handle at this point). The cyber-shot viewer that came with my camera met my needs for photo editing but did not offer a "delete picture" option or the capacity to print to a disk. I thought the print to disk option was a part of the Paint Shop package which it does not appear to be.
Buggy: I create digital scrapbooking graphics and frequently save items in .png format - which, with this program, can't be done properly. It does not retain the transparency. If you save it with the optimizer, you get an ugly background. Without the optimizer, it tricks you into thinking it is alright because it looks transparent to you - however, opening it in any other program (such as PSE, PSCS, PSP9, PSPX, etc) the transparency is replaced by a white background. As of yet, there is no fix for this. It runs extremely slowly and keeps losing track of where my plugins are saved. It's got potential if some patches to fix these issues are released.
New Version Is Complete Garbage: I too was excited about the new version of Paint Shop Pro. Then I installed it. It takes 2.5-6 minutes to start it with common operations that used to be done in real time taking seconds. Also the new layout of the dialog boxes add unnessicary extra clicks and moved useful functions like quick preview to inconvinient places. This together with it crashing 50% of the time I run it.Corel now admits that the program is really slow when you have a large image library and say they are working on a solution. If you are wondering what a large image collection is, I'm running at about 17 000 images, which Picasa handles quite fine.I would recommend trying to find Paint Shop Pro X right now and maybe upgrade to 12 when it comes out, but make sure to download the trial version when 12 comes out, because I agree, each version that Corel has come out with has been worse. Though I would call 10 a side step as they did add some good new features.
Do NOT buy this product !!!: I bought this because I have been using Paint Shop Pro for years .Corel put in a message center , which you are supposed to be able to turn off ...NOT !For over a week now , I get this pop-up from the message center to buy the new version ...pretty annoying if you want to use the program and have that window in the way constantly ! I called Corel and they gave me a "tip" on how to get rid of the messages , well that only worked until I reset my computer .I have been messing around with my registry and everything I could think of . NOTHING worked so far!Looks like I will be asking them for my money back .I don't need to be paying good money for a program that is pressuring me into buying a new version which I couldn't use unless I change my operating system !They must have been taking lessons from Microsoft !If you are smart , stay with an older version which still came from Jasc .
Sloooooooooooooooooooooooooow: And a resource hog. I'm sure it could be more stars but considering how long it takes to do ANYTHING & EVERYTHING it's extremely frustrating to use. After using it awhile you'll have to reboot your machine just keep using it or it'll freeze up and crash your system.
garbage: Get used to seeing "You chose to end the nonresponsive program, Paint Shop Pro XI". The "product" hangs up, crashes, and displays the ineptitude of its creators for all to see.
Way too slow, and frustrating!: I purchased this program and also got Photoshop Elements. I wanted to evaluate which is the best for my purposes--mainly adjusting and tweaking my digital camera's photos. I got up and running right away with Elements, but Paint Shop Pro took a long time to start up, and then I was frustrated trying to understand the program. The booklet that came with it was of course useless. Everything went slowly and I soon became frustrated. Others reviewers apparently liked it but it did nothing for me. I am returning it to Amazon for a refund. I'll stick with Photoshop Elements.
Switched from Elements 3....: I am semi-professional photographer and have been using Adobe Photoshop Elements 2 and then 3 for the last couple of years.. I was about to upgrade to Elements 5 when I read about Paint Shop Pro XI Photo and decided to switch and I am glad I did. PSPXI offers a lot more features than Elements and is more user friendly. I love getting special effects with one click of a button like the Glamor effect or any other film effects available. It looks like I am getting more things done in less time. Give it a try and download the trial version and see it for yourself. You might want to switch, too.
Did not pass QA. Buggy and Slow.: I have been a fan of PSP since version 5. For a fraction of the price it does 99% of what Photoshop can do, and the user interface is easier and more intuitive. HOWEVER, this new version is a huge step backwards, and it's a real shame. Whatever enhancements may have been added to the program are irrelevant, as its bugs and _insanely_ slow performance make it essentially un-usable. Basic operations, like opening the browser view, take forever. I've tried it out on two different systems, a Pentium 4 with 1G RAM and an Athlon X2-64 with 2G of RAM, and several times I've seen it completely hang after only a few minutes of use. Stick with PSP 9 or 10 and you will be much happier.
Excellent, Swinging band - listening samples incorrect.: This was the first jazz album I ever owned, which my stepmother's friend gave me when I was 10 - and while the previous reviewer mentions a double album set, my LP (Westinghouse Broadcasting) only had the same tracks that are on the CD:One O'Clock JumpBalkan Mixed GrillAvalonPoor ButterflyYou're Driving me CrazyBugle Call RagMean to MeKing Porter StompSing Sing Sing.The rhythm section swings hard - Arvel Shaw, Roy Burns, Billy Bauer and Rolland Hanna provide a solid feel - Rolland Hanna's solos add a more modern, be-bop sound, which is nice - we have a transitional band here, recorded in 1958, with roots in the swing era but influenced a bit by more modern styles as well.While it may be a pick up band, the playing is fairly tight, and with a fairly all star band, including Zoot Sims in the sax section, the soloing and ensemble work is quite good.
5 stars for Henry David Thoreau, 0 for Bill McKibben: This book would be a good presentation of the classic Walden if you tore out the introduction by Bill Kibben. While the annotations are helpful, the introduction is over the top, making out Thoreau as an environmentalist and climate change advocate. Totally self-serving on the part of McKibben. Thoreau was certainly a thinker outside the box, but an environmentalist he was not. To suppose that in this day he would be an advocate of climate change is laughable. Look for a true copy of Walden without the garbage added.
The print and size of book make it hard to read: Something about the way the book was put together, literally- the size of the book is too big and you cannot hold it right because the print is all the way to the middle crease. Very akward. Disappointed- damn cheap publisher! My mom has an old extra copy she is going to give me. This is going to goodwill.Thoreau is awesome. Too bad the book doesn't live up to his words.
Not recommended: I found this book to be very difficult to read and also very dull. The content was good but tedious. To be frank i would not recommend this "classic"
Look how smart I am: It is nice to read something like this even if the best case scenario now is to mock people who idolize Thoreau.Hes writing seems to have no point, no objective, except maybe to make himself seem very smart. I don't buy it. Nor do I buy into the ethics of squatting or the innocent beauty of nature.This book should be read:1) by hipsters who feel their life is pointless - they might be entranced with the descriptions of nature.2) by people who are tired of hearing people refer to Thoreau without reading his works.
classic: I chose Walden to read because it is considered a classic. Once I started getting into the book, I found that it was self centered writing. Just because he chose to live as he did, doesn't give him the right to pass judgement on the others in the community for the way they chose to live.
Walden, a life in the wods?: This was a well written essay of life in the wilderness. If only all of it were true. Thoreau was actually visited quite frequently by his mother and friends. They provided food and company for the lonely Thoreau. I have spent many months in the woods and only wish I could create the adventure Thoreau supposedly had.
free but incomplete: Walden itself gets 5 stars, but this free ebook is just plain incomplete. Pretty frustrating to be reading this and to all of a sudden come across missing parts, i.e. when Thoreau is enumerating his living expenses, all the information is missing. Instead I spent the $0.99 and got a complete and well formatted version ASIN: B0056OZR26 which also has an illuminating preface by Emerson.
Great Book Poor Formatting: I haven't picked up a free book for a while because of poor formatting issues. As I tried to read this one on my Kindle something kept bothering me. It wasn't until I was on the second page that I realized what was wrong.For some reason the entire book is off center. The right side flows all the way to the edge of the page. However, the left side starts off away from the edge. I tried to change the font to a larger size, but this just made it more noticeable.The text being off center doesn't seem like a big deal. However, I never got past it. It annoyed me so much that I ended up removing it from my Kindle because I just couldn't read it this way.
Walden- Thoreau's failed attempt at writing: The message of Walden is interesting, but Thoreau's writing ruins it. Not only does he excessively go off topic, but he also is not able to effectively communicate what he is trying to say.As for this edition, it is very good, and that is where the two stars of my review come from.If Thoreau were to publish Walden today, editors would refuse to let him do it.
Classics aren't always good.: Been reading some classics because I feel I should. This was not an engaging read. Got bored and skipped around to find interesting parts. Not sure how a writer can go on so long on his philosophy of life.
Good quality purchase: This book is a new print of a classic. I have not seen a copy of the original one, but this one seems to be written in the style of the day, and not what may be expected from modern books. I look forward to reading the whole thing, as it is one I have wanted to purchase for quite some time.
Amazing'y Insightful: The book is beautifully written and well worth anybody's time to read. There are timeless truths to be learned here...
Gets Better as I Age: I had to read this back in 8th Grade and found it b-o-r-i-n-g! What do you expect, I was 12. Oddly though, since then it sort of pops up in my mind periodically, like the smell of comfort food or a fond memory, so I've reread the book (in its entirety) every few years. It's like the best kind of friend--you can kind of wander off and do your own life but then return and find the connection is as strong as ever, you still find warmth and something for your soul there. I'm about to buy the Kindle format because it's summer and I need some good summer reading material, and Thoreau stepped in to fill that void. All the nice, wild, nature places are slowly going away and all that we'll have someday is Thoreau to remind us of how foolish we've been building condos and golf courses on all the ponds and woods and open meadows.
Beautiful and accessible: This edition of Walden is a joy to read, with lovely typeface and layout. I am not a Thoreau scholar, but found the annotations accessible and absorbing. The layout allows you to read Walden straight through or wander off into the annotated notes, depending on your mood.A book that serves as a miniature vacation every time you open it.
no more free books for me..: incomplete. missing quotes and other passages that were formatted differently in the original work. spend a dollar and get a readable version.
Do not read. It is incomplete.: As a previous reviewer mentioned, passages are missing. This is one of the best books ever written and it is a shame someone messed it up so much.
Missing quotes: Besides irritating formatting issues (as Mr. Wiggings mentioned in his review), I got over a quarter way through before realizing that the quotes are missing! I'd see many lines that just seemed to end with half a thought and a comma or double-dash, with nothing to punctuate his statement (price, poem, song, etc.). I just grabbed the MOBI version from Project Gutenberg ([...]) and everything seems to be in order. However be aware that THAT version has no table of contents (DOH!).So ... it's free, yes, but you're missing out on key elements of the book if you download this.
The Kindle Edition is terrible: I had to stop reading this kindle edition of the book because large portions of text were missing. Namely the list where Thoreau talks about how much all his building materials cost (not really that important) and (more importantly) any time he quotes someone. This is the free kindle edition.Since I did not want to pay any money for it I downloaded another edition for free from Project Gutenberg (gutenberg.org). They had a kindle version that includes civil disobedience and has a table of contents. Very nice! Reading that edition now and am enjoying the book itself.
Great condition: Walden, was just excellent. Even better than I thought it would be. Looks new. Very pleased.Thank you for sending it off so fast...
Burn the libraries; their worth is in this book.: As Omar said of the Koran, I say of Walden. This is the single greatest book I've ever read, hands down. Words really can't describe how amazing it is, though I doubt that it will affect many people the same way it has me. That said, this edition (the Konemann) is one of the best I've seen. The book itself is helpfully supplied with footnotes (which are something of a necessity for a born quoter like Thoreau), unobtrusively marked by a leaf in the margins of the pages, which refer you to the notes in the back: this is an excellent way to supply these notes without interrupting the flow of the text. There are no elaborate essays on the meaning of Walden, however, so the reader is left to judge the book on its own terms. The book itself is svelte and compact; a perfect backpack-sized vade mecum.This book, with shipping, is less than 10 dollars. It was one of the best purchases I've ever made.
Historically important writing: Great ideas in a mixed format, some great observations presented in poeticverse and some rant with confused presentation. Overall a great treatiseon getting back to the basics and in touch with nature to get in touch withonself.
One Great Book: I truly admire Thoreau's courage to be a pioneer in his time. He proved his point to be true that life can be perfected through simplicity and by using nature as an example. But his excessive detail that goes on for pages describing the shape of a pond may bore some readers.
Walden best book ever written: Not only is this an excellent read, it is a way of life. If you truly read this book more than once you will learn things about life and your place on this planet will be enriched. You will undergo changes, you must understand. Thoreau was a master at creating an alternative to living life in the fast lane. "Living Deliberatly" simply and with a purpose is so important, in this book you will learn how to do all of it. Your life will be better if you really try to understand. Even the slow parts have messages so be sure to pay attention. You will become awakened.
A Plethora of Riches: Jeffrey Cramer's annotated "Walden" weaves together the "woof" of Thoreau's philosophy and observances with the "warp" of all the influences upon him in his life, current and remembered. Cramer brings light to bear on the puns and allusions that would likely escape the reader of today. It is an uncommonly rich reading experience.The book itself is the best designed I can remember in years. The annotations are side by side with the text; the type is crisp and clear; the book opens flat for easy handling; and it is printed on fine stock. Cramer and Yale University Press have given us a rare gift.
Get another edition: This is a great book, of course. But this edition is awful. The font is tiny, the margins ridiculously thin. I was so disappointed to open the package and find this version.
I did not get it.: I think Thoreau was a nut-job. He must have been a communist for the academic community to make such a fuss about this book.
A waste of time...: This is the most horrible book I've ever read. If you think you can "discover yourself" or "discover the meaning of life" by going out into the woods by yourself well then you have a social problem. I don't believe a pond can tell you anything about people or about anything for that matter. What can happen to you if you go live in solitary for a long period of time is that you can develop a mental problem, and that's about it. Sure, lets get rid of everything in life that makes us happy, simplicity, simplicity, simplicity. Ha! This only sounds like a very depraved soul crying out for help. I think the only thing we can learn from this book is that it is not a good idea to go live in the woods by yourself, because it's hard. I say this book is a complete waste of time. It is perhaps the most boring piece of literature I've ever laid eyes. I say save your time and money and don't read this book.
Who doesnt' love Thoreau: I have loved Thoreau since I first read him in middle school and who doesn't love Thoreau. WALDEN is a great book to either revist Thoreau or read him for the first time. I would just say make sure you have the peace and the quiet to study his words for they transcend over time to even and especially to our absorbed lives.Take the time to read WALDEN and you will be able to see things more clearly in your own life.
Walden:Or, Life in the Woods: Am enjoying the book immensely. Haven't been able to compare it with a newer translation yet. It is as if he were writing it as an answer to every mans plea. Timeless writing indeed. As a writer that is what I dream of accomplishing, to convey that sense of enduring writing that speaks to every reader. Learning to be true to yourself is what makes a good writer. It is a process. Much like Thoreau.
Walden: Very disappointed! The abstract does not tell me the actual important content. I expected some kind of similarity or reference...
A naturalist bible: Such a good read, and re-read. I've came to admire Thoreau's philosophy and this book is why. Walden is becoming a even more popular read in recent years, and if you have any spirit of nature in you. Read this!
Oh Why: So I went thru this point in my life. Less is MORE... well it is. Less is a lot more. But this book was a sleeper after the first chapter.
Love the material, but fire the narrator: I'm reluctant to be harsh. But the narration ruins the audio book. I was very disappointed. The narrator is not only monotone (as another review suggests), but he speaks. Very. Slowly. And. Over. Emph. A. Sizes. Every. Syllable. No joke: he almost sounds like a computer voice synthesizer. It's distracting and it's hard to follow the prose. I listened to only one chapter and had to stop. I have more than two dozen audio books, and enjoying walking and listening. But I'll have to pick up a copy of the printed book on this one.
A fine piece of literature.: A poignant peek into one man's view of what is and should be the true importance of every man's existence. Thoreau in the 1800s already felt, in my opinion, strangled by too much, unnecessary stimuli. Once out in the woods, on his own, with just the basic necessities, he was able to reconnect with his true self. I can only imagine what he would think of today's world. Definitely worth reading.
Thoughtful and owning great meaning, a must read: Walden, just the name brings immediate thoughts and images. A wonderful read which makes you think, and reaffirms the important things in life. If this book doesn't change you, your probably dead already. Should be required reading.
The better part of a man will be soon ploughed beneath the s: Thoreau is great. Even if you don't agree with him, even if you see his contradictory nature towards his teachings, even if you can't understand him, you can't deny that he is an amazing thinker and an influential character of American history. Thoreau's quiet voice of solitude and non conformity provides refreshing alternatives of perception and observation which strengthens inner freedom and personal growth. I have read numerous essays by Thoreau and I have to say this could be the most enlightening. His ideas of progressing back to nature is beautiful inspiration to reevaluate our contemporary life.I recommend everyone read this book...Actually I take that back...I recommend everyone Henry David Thoreau and all of his beautiful work.
Good Author...Marginal Editor: I'm not super educated so take this for what it's worth. I read an excerpt of Walden in High School and ever since then I have wanted to read more. I finally got around to it and ordered this edited version. I like Thoreau's outlook even though his writing is a little much for me sometimes. McKibben does footnote some things to explain them. Most of those footnotes, though, are worthless. Some only refer to the other copyright information that Thoreau eludes to (or quotes). And worse even still is when McKibben puts in personal opinions and 'tree-hugger' facts to support what appears to be his agenda of conservation.His editing footnotes really had a poor impact on the book. What would have been useful for a 'hick' from Wyoming would have been some more translations of French words and explanations of references and ideas. That would have made the story much easier to read/understand and enjoy.
Terrible Design for a Book: This book is physically constructed in a very low quality way. I do not recommend it.There was no problem with the seller or the delivery or the condition, just the engineering of the product by the manufacturer.
Like panning for gold...: ...you have to sift through a lot.Thoreau has some really great, original ideas and approaches to life. He has whole sections that seem incredibly tangential but after you reread them, you realize they were perhaps the greatest parts of the book.That being said, he also has sections that are just incredibly tangential, and when you finish you miss things like narratives, a centered topic, main points, etc. These are just stream of consciousness it seems.
obviously not a thriller: this book is very similar to something dickens might have written.it has a serious tone that becomes a monotonous drone when it describes something and can be quite flavorless at times. i gave it two stars because the structure is better than grocery store romance garbage, but not something i could imaging anyone finding remotely fascinating.
Torture!: As a social studies teacher and a student of history one can not deny the importance of Thoreau's views on civil disobedience. The impact of his teachings on the world are amazing. Thoreau's views on civil disobedience and their affect on Martin Luther King and Ghandi helped make this world a better place. So again, I understand why Thoreau is important.Now onto Walden Pond. Do people actually read this and enjoy it? I was required to read this for a masters course in early American Intellectual Thought and man I will never read this again.Pages and pages of boring unimportant information about his daily life....zzzzz. How does anyone enjoy reading about how he built his hut or what clothes he wears. Can he bore us some more with his agricultural failures? This book was torture. Yes Thoreau is important, but so is my time and reading this book was a complete waste.If you have trouble sleeping, pick up this book
Reflective, yet limited: Thoreau was a reflective man. He asked pertinent questions, but just didn't go far enough in his search. As a pagan, he was unaware of the realities of Jesus Christ. In spite of his limited vision, he had some profound observations at times. One of my favorites is:"If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away. It is not important that he should mature as soon as an apple-tree or an oak. Should he turn his spring into summer?"
What a fantastic novel!: This book pretty much changed my life, and I just love this particular edition of the classic novel. If you've ever read Walden you know what a treat this particular work is. It really allows you to appreciate the convieniences of modern life!
Very Hard to Read - Poorly organized: This book is very hard to read as publisher has put in very small fonts and squeezed way too much text into pages. Feels like book from 19th century when they just invented printing presses.Therefore, the book is hard to read and navigate - don't buy the book from this publisher. Find another book where publisher wasn't so cheap with paper and space.
Boring; Induced sleep in me.: I found this book to be quite boring, and it took me a long time to finish reading it. I did find it interesting, however, as the author's personality does seem to change and become quite "different" the longer he was in seclusion from mainstream life. Other than that, I would not recommend this book, unless someone has insomnia and needs to fall asleep.
Thought I could read it, but was mistaken!: While I'm sure this is a great work of liturature that I should read, I was unable to get through it.....Maybe some day in the future, but not now.
one of the most influential books on my life: This book hit me in high school like a shimmering beam of light. It made me start questing my motives for what activities I was spending my time doing, what kind of clothes I was wearing, and what things I was saying. I think like many teens a lot of my actions had to do with wanting to impress my classmates or to put up an image that I thought would make me popular. Once I read this book I couldn't go through through life without asking "why am I doing this?" over all of my important decisions. It's liberating to choose what'll make you happy, not what you think will make others like or respect you.
Incomplete!: Just a few pages in, Thoreau puts in a few quotes from other authors, all of which are missing! This continues throughout the book, and was a deal-breaker for me. This book is about ideas, so critical elements cannot be ommitted. Walden without the quotes is like a car without wheels.
Great edition, Thoreau is timeless and important as ever: Often times a book you *should* read is one that isn't that enjoyable to read. At best, you have to work at it. The writing although informative, educational, and thought provoking is often complex, unapproachable, and drowned in archaic syntax. While not as easy reading as adult teen fiction, I'm about 1/3 of the way through and so far have been able to follow about 80% of it without needing to go back over anything or bust out my dictionary.The Kindle format itself is great and well adapted. No strange formats, no font oddities.As for the text, it should be pointed out that there is more to Thoreau than "simplify, simplify". His observations on the motivations and trappings of society are accurate and telling, proven even more by the fact that one hundred and fifty years have passed since its creation and little has changed.An outstanding text for anyone wishing to get more out of life and to distill out the things that are most excellent.
This is an incomplete version.: As other reviewers have noted this version is incomplete and sentences stop in the middle. It was free. My only expense was the time and effort put into discovering the shortcomings of this version.
It hurts to read: Why would any one want to read this book on their own accord? I found it to be the worst book in history. It's nothing more than a bunch of jumbled up statements that say one thing and deny it the next. He just repeated everything and since he couldn't make it in society, he moved to the woods. Is this supposed to show us how we are to live our lives, because if it is, shoot me now. He seemed to hate everyone and live with the animals and the pond. No one really cares what he ate or what he did for fun (if he can call it that), or how he failed in everything. If he wanted to find out who he was, he should've become a buddhist monk or something. I've seen someone else who left society and moved to the woods, and he is locked away for a long time for sending people bombs in the mail.
This was not a fun book: Do not read this book. This guy must have been stoned when he was in his cabin.
Torture: Henry David Thoreau's Walden is one of the most hypercritical, boring, repeatitive book I've ever had the pleasure of reading. He's completlely contridicts himself or repeats the same idea in a different form.Look at me; I'm a famous writer. I'm a famous write; look at me. Look at me, the famous writer. Me you will look at; the famous writer. Me the famous writer, you will look at.It goes on, and then he talks about beans and ants. Just horrid...it literally hurts to read.
A Matter of Taste: I prefer to lead a life of quiet desperation, in a city, surrounded by people who enjoy making money, and who pay taxes to support unjust wars.
Living deliberately stinks: DO NOT READ THIS BOOK AT ALL COSTS. THOREAU IS A RANTING FOOL. Take, for example, the sentance "I have a great deal of company in my house; especially in the morning, when nobody calls." There is nothing profound about this sentance, it just doesn't make sense. Some people just can't deal with the fact that this guy is a lunatic.
it is the worst book that I have EVER read: This is most definitely the worst book that I have ever read. Do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs. If you would like to know what it is about, i can tell you right now: it is a book about nothing.Thoreau goes on and on for ages, and he isn't really talking about anything...
A Study of the Beauty of Nature.: Thoreau was an American naturalist and Walden is his meticulously kept record of the phenomena in nature that he observed. He espouses the benefits of nature as well as the healing properties of simple toil and the benefits of rugged independence. Thoreau's mantra of "Simplify, Simplify, Simplify" has become pertinent again and again over the years since he wrote this little book. The book is an excellent nature book as well. Thoreau spent hours observing nature, and wrote about it with a simple and beautiful prose. Thoreau spent two years at the pond Walden. This book covers his observations during that time.
Worth reading: An interesting picture of the writer and his times. Not sufficiently gripping to retain me for the last 25%. But worth reading.
Doesn't hold up: This book chronicles Thoreau's 2 years in the "wilderness" building a cabin and farming a garden - he never mentions that the "wilderness" was just two miles outside his home town. The book doesn't hold up to scrutiny - for example, he claims that he dug a 5' x 7' root cellar into the side of a mountain in only two hours of digging with a shovel. If you enjoy reading expense ledgers accurate to a fraction of a penny, by all means get this book.
Walden: Walden, I have always wanted to read this classic. Since I live close to Concord I have visited the site many timesbut never got to read his books.
really cool garage rock.: Garage rock is all about a band just making great tunes. Unlike today where bands are not allowed to rise instead electronic garbage is crapped on us, this one is pure fun. Sam and the pharoahs had several big hits. But they really laid down some fantastic garage rockin tunes. Sadly the later sixties tried to be too serious for it's own good. I like that stuff but fun rock like this should have still been played. After this period Sam became a tugboat captain evidently , but his really cool party rockin songs are still with us. And this is one of the better best ofs out there.
perfect: Due to a back injury, I have to catheterize my dog (yes, really) 3 times a day - and your lubricant works perfectly.
Really like this shirt!: This is a well-designed and constructed shirt of 100% cotton. The material and design imprint really look great. The fit is very good. It does require ironing, as it wrinkles fairly easily, regardless of how it is washed and dryed. The price was very competitive.
Stiff, wrinkled like a cheap pillow case: Washed it in cold water, blead lots of red out. Came out of the washer wrinkled, I dried it on low, still completely wrinkled, and stiff. It's like wearing a plastic bag and as noisy. Bad cut. No shoulder room, baggy and not tapered like in the picture. Waste of money. I guess I could cut it up for rags ?
Very nice shirts!: I ordered these shirts for a Jimmy Buffett concert. I think they are beautiful! I like the way all the prints match up. Even on the pocket. They also arrived before they were scheduled to. Keep up the good work. Oh, and I was VERY impressed that they are made in Hawaii.
not durable: Item did not survive one day. First gust of wind ripped the canopy and twisted metal legs. Obviously inferiorly made product. Not made in USA.
Excellent product: I have used this product for years. Very convenient. Just pour in grease, when full close the top of the foil lined bag, and throw away. Bag holder & lid can go in the dishwasher. Works very well.
My Finest Review Ever: The Fat Trapper. It is a bag that stores the fat from your cooking until you have filled said bag and dispose of it. Then you take the new Fat Trapper Bag, and place in in your Fat Trapper for more use.Pure Genius.It has been my finest hour to review this item.
Easy clean up: These little bags make it so much easier to keep grease from cooking under control. With the bags, I donm't have to worry about clogging up my drains with left over grease or just dumping it in the trash - yuck.
Good Book: The illustrations in the book are really nice. I have both Volume one and two of Sorceress and they are both very good.The reproduction values are really good to reproduce what looks to me like pencil illustrator though they may be lite ink wash ether way reproducing this type of illustration and keeping the detail without making it blotchy to get all the details it difficult and the publisher did an excellent job.
Just a Frazetta's shadow.: Hoffman's work is just a pale imitation of Frazetta's talent. Being myself an artist I cannot understand why people that is already established in the art field keep trying to copy somebody else's work. It is probably fine when you star your career but after a while the logical path is to follow your own style. As an artist doesn't he fell ashamed? I certainly would. I recommend you to get a Frazetta's books first.
Nice add to my home studio: Great for Studio management , but if u try to go to stage with it maybe You ll back with a broken piece, too much plastic's pieces.
It sucks .: Do not waste your money on this it does work even if u r doin work out n eatin right ...n also make u feel bad ....
Wonderfully delicious...: I bought this book back in college after seeing the movie Body Double. I highly recommend picking up this movie. This reminds me of the way DVD's are now with their extra content and special features.Pick this one up. You won't be sorry.MC White said: Check it out!
A laugh out loud read: I really enjoyed this book and now I'm hooked on the series. I laughed so many times, my husband thought I was crazy! I usually read fantasy books, but I'm glad a friend of mine suggested it. Been a pleasant change of genre.
One for the Money: I read this book a few years ago and enjoyed it. Now I'm starting at the first one and plan to read all of them. It's funny and keeps you interested as well. A good read!
Fun reading: I'm so glad to have discovered this series! I haven't enjoyed reading this much in ages. I intend to read the entire series.
Great: The book was great. At times it took a little time to get into the book. I enjoyed reading it.
Love this book!: This is amazing ive read every book in the series and i still cant wait for the next one!
Loved the books...bummed about the movie casting: Love this character so much! Easy read...brain candy. Have read the whole series and was so disappointed to see they cast Katherine Heigl!!! Really??? Stephanie Plum is such a great character and can not see this twit in the role. Probably won't see the movie because I don't want her to ruin Stephanie for me.
"One for the Money": Do you like to be so entertained that you laugh out loud while reading a book? Do you like to get turned on by the sex scenes? Do you like to feel tense during the scarey parts? Do you like characters so well-drawn you feel like you can reach out and touch them? Do you like to read a book that makes you not want it to end? Then you will LOVE this book! AND you will love the audio version even more! Keep them coming Janet Evanovitch!
Guffawed out loud!: This book has it all -- murder, thrills, romance, and last but not least, laughs! I love a good mystery, but it's been ages since I also laughed out loud while reading one. In fact, my laughter was so contagious that my husband also laughed out loud (Stephanie's grandmother is exactly as outspoken as my mother...I can see my mom saying the same kinds of things.). Can't wait to read the rest of the series!!! Brava, Ms. Evanovich!
A funny, good book: After reading One for the Money, I couldn't wait for another Sephanie Plum story...I've read then all now and anxiously waiting for the 8th book. Good, relaxing, funny reading for the hour before bedtime.
Great debut novel: Stephanie Plum is one of the most down-to-earth, funny, and gutsy heroines to come around in a long time. When she gets laid off from her job as a lingerie buyer, she goes to her cousin Vinnie in desperation. She is expecting to get a filing job, but instead she becomes a "bounty hunter", bringing in crooks who have failed to appear for a hearing date. It sounds like easy money, until she actually tries to jockey some of these brutes into her car to take them to the police. They resist in every way possible and Stephanie does some fast, on-the-job training. Her first case is a former lover of hers who has committed a murder, with some debate as to whether it was self-defense. She pursues him while being pursued by a violent, sadistic boxer who threatens great bodily harm to her. This story is told in a breezy, tongue-in-cheek manner which is very appealing and causes it to be a page-turner.
Wanted to love it but...: This is another one of those books I wanted to badly to love and cheer about. Unfortunately, I was so put off by the flippant way the author portrayed a six year old being molested that I found myself unable to enjoy the rest of the book. The character lost my interest, and I found her actions predictable and juvenile. I am one who can willingly suspend belief for the sake of a good plot, but the idea that anyone could just become a bounty hunter overnight without any training (or brains) just didn't work for me. There were some humorous parts but they were not enough to earn more than two stars from me.
I could do without ....: the detailed descriptions of how Benito brutalized and raped women with broken beer bottles etc- after all, who needs these images in their head? Isn't the nighly news enough? Also, the crude language and setting just gives me an ugly feeling. That said, I liked Stephanie and her sense of humor, but I'm not sure I would read more of the series. The fact that these are bestsellers just proves to me that society is getting more and more depraved.
Terrible: It's been a long time since there came along a book that I couldn't finish. Try as I might, a little over half way through the book, I put it down. I can't imagine why this would have been made into a movie.
Great Book, Great Series: All of the Stephanie Plum books are great and this one introduces the characters in a wonderful and funny way. All the ladies that I work with love this series and we refer to it to describe our own lives. The situations that Stephanie finds herself in are so funny and are sometimes so close to the situations that you can find yourself in. Once you start reading this book, you won't want to stop until you finish!
Outstanding entertainment: Several friends had recommended this series; I was slow to warm to the idea. The books are entertaining, light, humorous and a real page-turner. For an afternoon "escape" this is the read.
Cannot get enough of her writing: Janet Evanovich is definitely one of the wittiest authors I have ever read.Her writing is so good that my husband and I fought over who got to read the book first. (We both started reading it at the same time.) I finished it in one day. I cannot get enough of her writing. I hope she writes a thousand more!Leah L Higbe's comments on "One for the Money" is a good review; she sums up everything I wanted to say.
Letdown! A Scooby Doo style mstery: I gave this book two stars because it was semi-entertaining, in a bad movie sort of way. It is not the hilarious book other posts have claimed. Maybe you have to be from Jersey to get it. It is generally predictable and unexciting. It is the equivalent of watching a movie made for the USA channel - same tired tv movie plot. My title refers to the Scooby Doo style ending. I'm sure anyone could find a better book than this. This was my first and last from Evanovich!
Talk about your crap movie of the week book......: How could anyone rate this book with 5 stars? It was poorly written, filled with cliches and the characters were not at all likeable or redeeming. Put this on the back shelf and only read if you are desperate.
Is it me?: I wanted to like this book. If I liked it, then I'd have all those sequels to look forward to. But I couldn't get past the first chapter. Glib, smart-alecky, first-draft-feeling, it just felt too loose and unedited, un-thought-out. No style. More like a boilerplate for people wanting to make a quick buck writing easy paperback mysteries. I skipped around in the book after that, but nothing caught my attention. I even finally read the last few pages, but all I realized was that I would never be able to endure this character for a whole book, much less a whole series. Stephanie Lemon, I'd say.
Fun in the sun: This was a great fun read for the beach. I loved all the characters in this book. This book was fun, witty and had lots of action in it. It is a great intro to the Plum series. It makes you want to get the next one in the series right away. If your looking for a fun very fast read look this one up, you will not be disappointed.
Bought it as a Kindle Read: I bought this as my first Kindle Book. What a hoot! I have never laughed so hard reading a book. Stephanie Plum is a wise cracking "I can do this Bounty Hunter" crap kind of girl. My sister-in-law kept telling me you should read the Stephanie Plum series from Janet Evanovich. I am such a Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown book enthuasist that I kept resisting until I bought my new Kindle(2). I thought why not try her first one and see what all the talk is about. Well let me say, I read "One for the Money" in one day and have started on "Two for the Dough". The story line is good but the humor is worth the price of the read. Give it a try if you like a light fun read, you won't be sorry.
One For the Money: I thought that this book was great! Very funny-I was laughing out loud while reading it.I have read all five of Janet Evanovich's novels and loved them all. I can't wait for the next one!
Too dumb to live: Evanovich is a wonderful writer, giving a great sense of place and well drawn characters. But Stephanie Plum? Oy! I wanted to throw the book across the room. She drags an injured woman through her apartment window? Even a high school student would know better. She hears, on the phone, a man whose identity she knows torturing a woman. Does she call the police? No. She plugs in her answering device. Dozens of other utterly absurd actions show her to be a total [mindless person]. She is so stupid that she becomes a primary cause of another person being shot!I must say this is the absolute worst book of its kind I have ever read.
More like 3 1/2 stars: Unemployed and down on her luck, Stephanie Plum takes a job with her cousin Vinnie's bail bond service as a bounty hunter. Soon she is on the heels of Joe Morelli, a cop wanted for murder with whom Stephanie also has a complicated personal history. This is a light, breezy story whose main charm is its amusing lead character, who narrates the story and her many screw-ups on the way to ultimate victory in a very humorous voice. The end disappoints by denying us a major confrontation that seemed inevitable and by falling back on the old device of the villain who is undone because he takes the time to explain his schemes. Still, it remains a fast, enjoyable read.
one for the money...: This book is a GREAT comedy/mystery. It is so funny and is definitly a page turner with a laugh a page. recommended to anyone who wants to read a great book and be completley entertained! I wish i could give this books 10 stars!
A Stroke of Genius: I'm tired of authors trying to creat masterpieces. It doesn't work. Fancy language, and symbollism doesn't amount to anything without a decent story. Janet Evanovich realizes this. She has written a hilarious, brilliant dark comedy that never tries to be a classic, but will end up being one anyway.
Fun... sometimes sexy: I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. The lead character is a real kick in the pants. I can definitely recommend this easy-to-read and fun book about a semi-bumbling, attractive, novice detective to any and all. Great summer, lounging-around-the-pool, read.
Oh My! Is that a GUN!?: Stephanie Plum is a laid off lingerie buyer for a store that just went out of business because of its shady connections. She's late on her care payment and she can't find a job. So what does she do? In typical burg (Trenton, New Jersy) style she blackmails her cousin Vinnie into giving her a job as a Fugitive Aprehension Agent, aka a bounty hunter.This is the first in a series of so far 9 book by Janet Evanovich featuring Stephanie Plum and her adventures. If you LOVE to laugh these are the books for you. I'm talking about laughing till you cry type laughing, big belly laughts.Ms. Evanovich thoughout her series maintains and improves on a series of characters that we grow to love or hate as the case may be. The author has a easy reading writing style that coupled with her obvious sense of humor combines to create a book and a series that are funny, entertaining and with a dash of mystery thrown in are very much worth the reading time!
One for the Money: One for the Money takes place in the "burg" located n New Jersey. The main character, Stephanie Plum, is in trouble with debt when her car gets impounded because she has been lacking on her payments. She starts to get cut off from the world when she doesn't pay her bills and she loses her phone and she almost loses her electricity. She ends up buying a car with a microwave and some other appliances. It is a truly fun book to read. She takes a jog from her cousin and becomes a bounty hunter. She will get $10,000 if she catches someone but that someone is an ex-cop and the book has some weird twists. Read it NOW!!!
Funny, Easy Read: I am always surprised at how harshly some judge books. There are some truly terrible books out there. This is not one of them.The author uses the perfect voice for her character. The plot is pretty good. The setting allows for some very funny scenes. There were parts of the book that made me uncomfotable, though I don't think Evanovich went into too much graphic detail.Overall, I think it was well written and funny. If you're looking for something thought provoking and deeply sentimental, this isn't it. If you're looking for entertainment and a few laughs (and you don't take yourself too seriously), you might like this book.
"One For the Money": I tried reading this book because i was always hearing how great it was. I could not wait to stop. This book is written for a fifth grader and is horrible. The plot would never happen and the violence is unrealistic and does not go with the rest of the story.
The start of a great series!: This is the book that will get you hooked on Janet Evanovich. It's the start of a great series - how many other series keep you anxiously awaiting the next book after you've already read a dozen of them?
Well-written story about a woman turned bounty hunter: Stephanie Plum is broke. She is desperate. Once she learns that she can make $10,000 as a bounty hunter, she decides to learn the tricks of the trade. Her first task is to bring in Joe Morelli, someone from her past. Now he's a cop accused of murder and presently, on the lamb. Stephanie learns the trade the hard way as we follow her foibles and mishaps, yet there is something endearing about her obstinate attitude. In search of Joe, she gets mixed up with a sadistic boxer, his manager, two call girls, and a butcher. Evanovich, the author, writes superbly with a tight plot and witty prose. A fun read that doesn't disappoint you!
BOOK BOUGHT IN TERRIBLE CONDITION!: I JUST BOUGHT AND RECEIVED THIS BOOK IN THE MAIL AND IT'S IN SUCH BAD CONDITION; I DON'T EVEN WANT TO READ IT....I COULD HAVE BOUGHT IT NEW FOR LESS MONEY, AND NOT WAITED A WEEK TO GET IT....IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN VERY GOOD CONDITION! BALONEY.DON'T BELEIVE IT.
One who is addicted to these books: I have read all twelve of Janet's books in the Stephanie Plum series and I am absolutely hooked and am waiting for her latest book to be available in January of 2007. I never used to be an avid reader until I started these books. If you want some light reading that keeps you laughing at the antics of some of the characters these books are for you! I love the way Janet makes these characters seem so real.
Awful: I had heard a great deal about how wonderfully humourous this series is, so I decided to start with book number one. What a mistake. I am not amused by either junior high humour or violence against women. I found this to be a dreadul book with a sophomoric plot and a degrading, violent, abusive view of women. I did not finish it and will never read another book by this author. I stongly suggest no one else do so, either.
kmb: Estremely sad for all the vulgar gutter language and poor taste of speech that added nothing to the plot nor story. The story could have been interesting otherwise but this depleted its message. I am saddened over ordering it and will not be reading any of her other books.
Poorly Written: I am an avid reader of this genre, and was excited to begin a new series and bond with a new heroine. Unfortunatly the level of writing was poor, and I do not intend to read any more of this author's books. This book was written at a high-school reader's level, but with adult content. In my opinion a bad combination.
I'm hooked!: Ok, I'm hooked! I absolutely loved this book and can't wait to read them all!!! Stephanie Plum and all of the characters are hilarious!!!! Loved it!
I am addicted: I am completely addicted to Stephanie Plum! I read this book because it came highly recommended by a friend and I was not disappointed. I can't get enough of this series! I look forward to many more Stephanie Plum books.
Glad I Found the Plum Series!: If you are looking for a deep mystery thriller, this series isn't for you. If you are looking for a series to read that is laugh out loud enjoyable, then I highly recommend Stephanie Plum and her friends to you. Stephanie is down on her luck (and money) and talks (coerces) her cousin, Vinnie who owns a bail bonding company into giving her a job as a Bounty Hunter. This is the first book of the series and lays the ground work for each subsequent book. Evanovich's writing is smart and sassy and a pleasure to read.
Fun read: Sometimes I like to take a break from hardcore detective stories and tearful literary masterpieces and sit back with a fluffy story that makes me laugh. This series fills the order nicely. I actually laughed out loud on more than one occasion and even a loud audible gasp that drew the question "What on earth are you reading?" Lots of fun here, but don't come into it with any expectations.
Plots and Subplots: Outstanding!If I were forced to describe Janet Evanovich and her Stephanie Plum series, beginning with "One for the Money", in only one word, outstanding would be it. Evanovich has created a wonderful balance of crime/mystery and comedy with a heaping helping of romance mixed in as well.Stephanie Plum is determined, if nothing else, and no one or no dumpster will stand in her way of collecting the cash prize for turning in a wanted bail jumper. Question is, how does an out-of-work woman with no experience in catching criminals perform such a feat?Prepare yourself for a wild and hilarious adventure. You won't be disappointed!
Fun reading: I was told I couldn't find this book used. I did and I loved it. Lots of fun to read. Now I see why it's hard to find used.
First book in excellent series: Stephanie Plum goes to work for her cousin, Vinnie, as a bounty hunter. Her first assignment, worth $10,000 is to bring in Joe Morelli who is a cop accused of murder. She and Joe have a past (fleeting though it may be) but she is determined to bring him in. She runs into him quite a bit but he doesn't "let" her catch him. The characterization is great and there are a few laughs. I have read the whole series and they only get better and better and laugh out loud funny. This is one of my favorite series. Stephanie and Joe's relationship alone will keep you turning the pages.
One For the Money.....: I thought that this book was hysterical. Fast read and could not wait to get my hands on the next Stephanie Plum book. I hopeful that we see where Stephanie and Joe go with their relationship. I like the mystery and light touch of romance.
Entertaining: This was a great book. I laughed and then I would be scared something bad was going to happen. Definitely kept me on edge!! I love it!! Can't wait to see the movie.
Easy read, interesting characters: Book was an entertaining and easy read. Her characters are interesting and I felt like I had a real fee for them quickly enough to keep my interest. I normally like things with a little more adrenalin but this book was good and kept moving at a reasonable pace.
One for the Money: A very entertaining idea. The book is filled with interesting characters that you want to know more fully. I will probably be ordering more Stepanie Plum books in the future.
Fun Read!: I really enjoyed this book! It was so funny, I found myself laughing outloud. I would recommend it to anyone and all of the books in this series. Some of you people just need to lighten up and enjoy this for what it is--a fun read!
Funny Funny!: I haven't laughed so much while reading a book for a long time! This book is full of great characters that are fun to read about. I first got the recommendation to read the Stephanie Plum series a few years back from a clerk at the book store after she caught me picking out romantic suspense, but I tend to read more from the "romance genre" so I waited awhile before trying. I've only read two in the series so far, and so far the developing relationship between Plum and Joe Morelli sure is pulling me in. This is a great book for readers who enjoy laughing, a mystery, and a bit of romance.
Fun Easy Read: This book was a fun, easy read. I laughed alot and it held my interest. You can't help but like the main character.
one for the money: i read this book i like it want to read the rest of the series it keeps you interresting in the book fron the start to the end
Funny and tense at the same time: The characters in this book are what make it so charming. The first couple of pages describing how Stephanie met Joe when they were kids sets the tone for the whole story. If it makes you laugh, you'll love the book, if it offends you, read no further.
A fine and easy read: This was a really fun book. It reminds me of a Bridget Jones type character doing bounty hunting for the first time and getting in more and more trouble on the way. It is very entertaining and a fast moving novel. I cannot wait to see this in the movies. Stephanie Plum makes you laugh throughout the book. This was my first book I read of the series and look forward to reading more. I read this on my kindle and had gotten it at a time when it was offered for a bargain. From the beginning of the main character's job in bounty hunting your interest will be captivated in order to find out what is going to happen to her. Is she every going to get the $10,000 by turning Morelli or will he continue to escape every attempt made for his capture. I highly recommend this book.
Don't pass this one up!: I started laughing after the first sentence and only stopped after finishing the last page. Janet Evanovich's naritive style will keep you entertained and wanting more. A real page turner. Read this first Stephanie Plum mystery and you will be hooked for life.
Fast Paced with Quite a Punch!: Janet Evanovich's first book of her Stephanie Plum series delivers a fast paced story packing quite a punch, literally!Stephanie Plum is out of work, broke and almost hungry. She blackmails her cousin Vinnie into giving her a job. Not just any job, though. Gutsy, mouthy and funny Stephanie is about to tackle life as a Bounty Hunter!When Stephanie is handed her first assignment she is in for a real ride and a blast from the past because this first assignment is capturing none other than her first "sort of boyfriend", Joseph Morelli. Not only does Stephanie want to bring Morelli in for the money, but she also has quite the bone to pick with him!After finishing Evanovich's first book in this promising series, I am itching to get my hands on book number two, Two for the Dough.
Excellent book; excellent series: This book is the start of a terrific series. It hooked me from the first sentence. If you like a little romance, a lot of humor and a great mystery, you've just found it.
What a hoot!: This book cracked me up. The set-up is unlikely -- Stephanie Plum, out-of-work lingerie buyer, becomes a bounty hunter -- but it's tons of fun. The plot was well-done and interesting, but you should really read this book for the characters. They're all vividly drawn and unforgettable, running the gamut from slightly zany and unpredictable to completly and utterly insane.I just about died laughing. This book is a real treat.
Abridged means the good parts are goone: I am new to the books on cd so I didn't realize that abridged meant they took what they considered the unessential parts out. That means all the humor, all the real meat of Ms Evanovich's style are gone and you get just another action story to fall asleep to at night. I loved the book and wanted to share the story with my daughter who doesn't have time to read but likes to listen to the stories on her way to work. I am embarressed to give this to her after I have raved about the author's writing because it is just dull. Why would anyone put out something so disappointing. I noticed they have all been abridged and while I was ready to start buying all of them, now I will not be buying any more. Enjoy the books but do not expect much from the audio cds.
Different Mystery: I liked this book quite a lot... Starts off very strongly, but the end is extremely tacked-on and confused. In a lot of ways, this isn't really a "mystery" in that it is just a wandering character study with a murder at the center of the story. I didn't feel like I had a hope of figuring out the crime, as I didn't get the feeling that the author knew or cared how it was going to end as she wrote it.
This book made me laugh out loud!: I enjoyed "One for the Money" very much. Being a "Kinsey Malone" fan, I had a hard time accepting a new heroine. The beginning of the book presented some pretty zany stuff, like grandma shooting the chicken, but once I got past that, I found myself engrossed in the story and at times laughing out loud. I immediately orded the next two in the series. NJL
Not so funny: Having read Hot Six, I decided to read all the books in the numbered series in order. I started with One for the Money.The books are supposed to be amusing, but I found this one very disturbing. In addition to the fact that Stephanie's financial and social circumstances are miserable, she is almost publicly raped by a man she is interviewing and has to be rescued by the suspect she is hunting.Then the would-be rapist stalks her.He telephones her that he is leaving her a present. This which turns out to be a black prostitute, Lulu, left hanging naked and mutilated on Stephanie's fire escape.In future novels in the series Lulu becomes the comic relief.Lulu
Wish I had known...: I don't care how great this book would have turned out to be if I had finished it. Within the first 30 pages, Stephanie recalls the sex she had with the guy she's hunting down when she was 6 and he was 8 years old; and her Grandpa Plum shooting a grossly neglected family pet to end the animal's pain and suffering. If I had known about the distasteful elements in this book, I would never have purchased it.
Bored: I was looking forward to a series of books that so many seemed to enjoy. However, I am slogging through One for the Money. It is so slow moving and the characters are flat, lack charm or any other appeal. I don't think I am going to be able to finish the book
A movie is being made??????????: What the heck, this book, like all her others, really stinks. Janet's books are so stupid it's embarassing to be seen reading them.
It's disgusting (to me, anyway) - but violence sells.: I was really enjoying this light and funny book until I got to the graphic descriptions of violence against women. Don't we get enough of that at the movies? I threw the book away.
Two stars for completing the book: I first saw the author on Sunday morning getting interviewed in New Jersey. Apparently she was a big success. I bought the first book and read it and passed it on to my friends. None of us liked it at all. Compared to what is out there this is weak. She does do an excellent job of describing New Jersey it is an awful place. I didn't like the main character or any of the others. The grandmother had potential but was highly unlikely as written. The reason for the success of Who wants to be a Millionaire-which I absolutely don't like and the success of this book may be the missing link to all of it. Sue Grafton or J.A. Jance are phenomenally better.
A definite re-reader!: This was the first Janet Evanovich book I had ever read, but it won't be the last! I fell into the story from the first few pages and found it very hard to put down. I'll certainly be reading the other books in this series. Highly recommended for those times when you're looking for a book to lift your mood with a little mystery thrown in for good measure.
FUNNY!!: Stephanie Plum (main character) is a RIOT! There are also other very humorous characters, namely Grandma Mazur. This was the first book in the series that I've read and before finishing it I went out and ordered the next 10 books. It is an easy read with a lot of fun along the way. I often caught myself laughing out loud. (maybe not such a great idea in a public place...people might think your nuts but what the heck...go for it) For any of you that have read Harlen Coben's Myron Bolitar Series or Sue Grafton's A-Z series you might find Stephanie to be a good cross between Myron and Kinsey.(Whom both I love) I highly recommend this book and the series.
janet evanovich one for the money: The book was as described however it was not the full sized book but the book club edition. This was disappointing.
Not all readers like it, though: This book was recommended to me at a bookstore that specializes in mysteries, and I have a hard time understanding why. The characters are largely stereotypes, and the result reads more like a Hollywood treatment of a mystery than a novel. The background for the plot centers on bail bonds, but provides little detail beyond what one could glean from watching a good movie like "Midnight Run." I notice that many of the (extemely positive!) reviews here are written by people who begin by saying "I don't like mysteries, but. . . " Well, I can see where that might be the case, and respect their opinions (with the one exception that I can't understand the positive comments on the "romance" in the book because it is so preoccupied with sexual violence). But as someone who loves this genre, this book struck me as an unsuccessful attempt at marrying Robert B. Parker and Sue Grafton.
Light Refreshing Read!: I bought this book for the beach, looking for something light, and I could not put it down. Stephanie Plum was easy to relate to, and the book was very funny at times. My only complaint, being from New Jersey (near Trenton), were the Jersey stereotypes. First, the only "radioactive" areas in Jersey are near Elizabeth and Newark. Second, we DO NOT wear turquoise or midnight blue eyeliner with cherry red lipstick, spandex shorts, and gold hoop earrings...maybe in the 80's, but not in '94. Third, the dialect was a little off. We don't start out any sentence with "probably." Once I got past the false "jerseyisms" I was able to get more into the characters. I guess I would have enjoyed it more if I weren't from Jersey.
Mufasa's Kickin' reveiw: One for the Money takes place in the suburbian parts of New Jersey . The Main character is Stephanie Plum. She is in big trouble with paying the bills because she just got laid-off her job as a lingere dealer. Then she has to get a job fast because if she doesn't then she will lose her apartment and will have to move into her parent's house. In her parent's house, her grandma lives there. They have dinner at exactly 6:00. But after Stephanie takes a job from her cousin, she won't be on time as often as she would hope. Once she pursues the man shes after for the money then she will have to worry about a boxer/ rapist that will be after her what will happen to this newbie Bounty Hunter?
Great book and great read: Was not sure about this author but my sister-in-law received several of her books and passed the first three on to me. Then I went to Kindle 'touch and found that her books did not cost as much as some and so purchased the the first 3 of the series. Have not had time read no 2 and no 3 yet as have been very sick. Expect them to be good reads as well.
Fun: I loved reading my first ever Janet Evanovich novel. It was fun, unexpected and I read it in one sitting.It's not anything too deep, which is what I was looking for. Her book(s) came recommended by a friend. Looking forward to more about Stepnanie and her adventures.
Good read: The book overall was a good read...This was my 1st book that I've read from her, and I am very eager to read the 2nd book in the Stephanie Plum series...In the beginning/middle (in between) you run across slow parts, but if you keep reading and get near the end, you will not want to put the book down until your done. Plus it had an interesting ending, you suspect one person, but it turns out to be someone else which makes sense.
Great book!!: I had heard how good these books were from other people but just never took the time to check them out myself. I am so glad I did!! Great writing! I found myself getting involved on page 1 and couldn't put it down. Stephanie Plum is quite the character. Down on her luck and without a job, she goes to her cousin Vinnie in hopes of getting a job filing. Instead, she ends up a bounty hunter on the hunt for Morelli, a man from her past. I found myself laughing out loud at her family, especially her mother and grandmother. Stephanie jumps right in on the search for Morelli and gets more than she bargained for when she encounters a prize fighter who ends up stalking her. I have heard they were going to make these books into movies. I can't wait to see them! Sandra Bullock would be perfect for the role of Stephanie, much like her character in Miss Congeniality!! This book is a must read! Can't wait to read the rest of the series!!
Skip One and start with Two...: Don't get me wrong - I LOVE the series, and cannot wait for each new book. But, I recommend to my friends that they skip the first book and start with Two or Three. They'll meet the characters just fine without the first one.In my opinion, the first book is too 'raw.' The sex and violence are too graphic. To me, it seemed that the author wasn't certain what sort of book she wanted to write. By the second or third in the series, she hit her stride and got more comfortable with her own characters and genre. But the first in the series just isn't comfortable in its own skin.Enjoy the series, though! It's a hoot! I live in NJ and work in Trenton, and love the "local" references.
My grilfriend and i made a deal: She would read a book of my choosing, which ended up being "Wizards First Rule" by Terry Goodkind, and I would read one of her choosing, which ended up being "One For the Money" by Janet Evonivich.After thoroughly avoiding the book like the plague for over half a year I finally got around to reading it. Being a big fan of fantasy and sci-fi I wasn't really sure how much I'd like it, but for some reason I did.The story moves at a smooth and generally fast pace never wasting time making the reader bored. It's a murder mystery/ book of self discovery about Stephanie Plum a woman who is out of money and taking on the life of a bounty hunter to get a living.So to all those of you who loved Terry Goodkind, or to those of you who like this genera of books(whatever it is, mystery I guess?) then this book is for you! I give it 4 stars because I liked it. So you should read it to. I love you Amanda! bye-bye.
Go Stephanie Plum: I've been hearing lots about these books, but hadn't had a chance to try one yet. I would see my boss read and just start laughing! So, I picked up the first book...Wish I hadn't waited so long.The writing style is engaging and the pace is fast. I read it in one day! Because, I had a very hard time putting the book down. When the book ended, I went to the store and got the second book and order 4-7 on amazon. I plan on grabbing the rest too.It's easy to see why this series is so popular. The fun characters and storyline make for quick, light, and FUNNY reading. I'm looking forward to reading the rest and cann't wait to get them.BUY IT! READ IT! AND LAUGH!!!
a little to slow for me.: I really tired to get into this book but I couldnt get past chapter 4 or 5. I enjoy a good mystery or action book but there was way to much slow paced details for my taste. I couldnt finish it.
Best thing since sliced bread: I loved this book. I have read all five books in the series in less than a week. I can't wait for the next installment!
Pretty good reading: I enjoyed this. It combined humorous times with real life struggles of a single young woman struggling in the world. Great reading.
Better than the movie: Real characters, a decent plot with realistic consequences to both good and bad decisions made by a spunky cast. Over the top at times, but an enjoyable romp.
Great Read!: This is a great book as are all the Stephanie Plum novels! Always entertaining and I find it hard to put them down!
Good Read: I enjoyed this book because it was absurd, funny, and clever, but mostly I think it was because I would love to be as badass as Stephanie Plum. She's spunky, sexy, entertaining, and makes the perfect character for this wild goose chase of a plot. Personally, I prefer books that have a bit more substance to their plots and characters but if you're looking for a book with lots of comedic entertainment value then this book is a great choice!
Suspense, Mystery, Passion, and Humor!: Stephanie Plum is a person with character. Sheloses her job, sells some of her belongings andthis is when she decides to become a bounty hunter. Through trial and error Stephanie learns the ropes of bounty hunting. The relationship that goes on between Stephanie and Joe Morelli, who she is trying to bring in for jumping bail, is refreshing and funny. Must read book that will have you hooked on the Stephanie Plum series!
Fast paced, Funny, FANTASTIC!: Ok, so I judged this book (well, the whole series actually) by the cover....I love the bright colors and the clever titles! I read this book in one sitting and laughed all of the way through! Stephanie Plum and her "adventures" with Morelli and the "bad" guys were fantastic! I never knew what to expect around the corner (which is a problem for me with Mystery/Thrillers) and I was intrigued the whole way through! Heck, after reading this, maybe I could become a bounty hunter! I loved reading about the dinners with her parents, her pistol-happy grandmother, and her "romantic" encounters with Morelli (the boy who seduced her back in her school days). HIGHLY recommended book! I can't wait to read the second one and hope that Stephanie can get her guy!
A great new character: I enjoyed this novel. Well written, very funny. One word of warning for the "thin skin" crowd. There is a bit of obsenity in the book. While it is all in character, I could see some folks taking offense. I think what I like best about Stephenie Plum is that is a klutz and knows it. A great read.
V. Disappointed: After hearing so many great things about Evanovich's series, I decided to start with the first one. I must say I was very disappointed. The quality of the writing made me feel like I was reading a romance novel, with non of the romance parts. In addition, although I must admit I did giggle a few times during the book (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, I also only give 1 star to books that I can not finish), I really could not stand Stephanie, the main character. I have read many wonderful books where you are supposed to hate the main character. This was not Evanovich's intention, however. This was a book where you were supposed to be on Stephanie's side the entire time. All I could think of the entire time was how pathetic she was. And not even in an interesting to read about pathetic type of way. Please do not waste your time or money on this book...
One for the Money: I have not read the book yet, but my daughter has and recommended it to me.Usually always enjoy the books she has suggested.
Simplistic and boring: One of the most boring mystery/crime novels that I have read. It was predictable the language was uninspired. I would highly recommend Dennis Lehane and Michael Connelly over this author.
Hmmmm: This book is refreshing and hilarious! What a great bunch of characters and an interesting plot! Easy and great read.
A MUST Read Comedy Series!!!: The first book of 18 is actually the worst. The book is what I would consider "pretty good" on it's own but AMAZING as an over all series. I truly recommend you read the whole series. Each book is better than the previous one. I cry from laughing so hard as I get into the double digits. This is a book you can't take seriously. It's definitely a light-hearted just for fun type of book that turns into a Lucy/Ethel comedy type of series.
My favorite series: So excited this is coming out in movie form! But you can't beat the book, I guarantee it. Don't read unless you want to be hooked.
Intriguing: One for the Money was a book chosen in my book group. I had read another Evanovich that I wasn't impressed with but this was a delightfully different experience. From the beginning I wanted to continue to read.This was also the first book I read on Kindle. One for the Money was a great introduction to a wonderful system. It held my place, went back and forth so easily.I am looking forward to continuing the series, it was so intriguing!
Fun read!: Stephanie Plum is a blast! A fun, and irrevirent character surrounded by a perfect supporting cast of characters. I'm on # 11 of the 18 books!
Excellent book - funny!: Read this book in 1 1/2 days - could not put it down. Very funny - I highly recommend. I am hooked on this series. Already read 2 and 3. I'm ready for the 4th in the series. Lots of suspense, action, humor, and even some romance. Light reading. Take a break from the routines and work - relax with a Stephanie Plum novel. You'll be hooked!
Great Read!!: I picked up the book at my friends urging at how great it was. I usually don't have much time for reading but I needed something to read on the plane so I thought I would give it a try. These books are addicting. Since the trip two months ago, I have read 1 through 6 of her books plus Full Bloom, and Manhunt. I love Janet Evanovih's writing style. It is just plain fun.
Great-Timeless: One for the Money- after reading the first one I am glad I found this great series to continue on with!
A good light read.: This is a good fast read. A light comedy, mystery with no major thought required. For those of you with ties to the Phillie,New York, New Jersey region, you know these people/places, so there's an added kick to the tale.
Funny: Recommended from a family member. Just fun reading, nothing intense, deep, or mind bending. Just fun that's it, and sometimes that's all you need.
AN AUSPICIOUS DEBUT FOR OUR FAVORITE JERSEY GIRL: As a mystery writer with my debut novel in its initial release, I was utterly charmed by Stephanie Plum's auspicious debut. In ONE FOR THE MONEY, Janet Evanovich launched the career of everyone's favorite Jersey girl. Trenton-tough Stephanie is so broke she has to drink her last beer for breakfast. She manipulates her cousin Vinnie into letting her give the bond recovery business a try. She has to bring in Joe Morelli, an ex-boyfriend from her teengirl years. Her attempts to catch this cop accused of murder are hilarious, as has been the rest of Ms. Evanovich's winning series. Great book!
A wonderful discovery: I am always so excited when I find a new series of good mysteries! Janet Evanovich has done a great job in portraying a funny, gutsy heroine who does what she has to to survive. From driving her graffiti-d Nova to learning to use a gun, Stephanie Plum is equal to any situation life throws her (with the possible exception of the mamas in the Burg!). This book is fast-paced, funny and just plain fun. Excellent summer (or anytime you need a lift) reading!
Wonderful, Excellent & Amusing: Anyone who doesn't like this book has NO SENSE OF HUMOR. This is not (repeat: NOT) a serious, gritty mystery a la Sue Grafton. This is a completely fun book, pure Godiva chocolate. I have given this book to many people, all of whom loved it and bought the others in the series. You really can't go wrong with Stephanie Plum.
Very enjoyable reading if you like Grafton et. al.,: If you live in Trenton, NJ, you may recognize the landscape in the background. I don't and didn't. However the main character is vibrant and alive, and very life-like. I enjoyed it enough to buy Book 2. Evanovitch is one of the authors I look for now.
janet evanovich is my hero: Surprisingly enough, my aunt Cathy started me reading this series, and I have to say that after reading all seven of her books (I'm waiting for eight to come out in paper back), there hasn't been one that hasn't made me bust a gut laughing. Stephanie is hilariously inept, honest, and so real that I wouldn't be surprised to run into her walking down the street. And Grandma Mazur is the funniest supporting character in the series. Her antics never fail to make me laugh. These books were not what I expected from a mystery series, but they are refreshingly different, laugh-out-loud funny, and I am proud to say that they comprise the majority of my tiny college bookshelf.Keep 'em coming, Janet!
Laugh your head off: The great news is there are six more in the series.Number 7 comes out soon.They are truly addicting. I can't wait to see what oddball character we get to meet this time. The one with the midget is hysterical.The six foot something cross dresser is a hoot to.I wouldn't want to be in her shoes to have to decide between Ranger and Morrelli.
Great stuff!: Janet Evanovich has to be one the the best crime writers to date. I love her characters, plot, and especially, her humor! This book is wonderful from beginning to end!
This isn't much of a comedy...: Honestly, I see tons of people saying how awesome this book is and I was so disappointed with it that I actually returned it for a refund. The main character is ridiculous. She's idiotic, consistently walking into situations that any moron can see will backfire and put her in danger. If you like watching people make asses of themselves, this is the book for you. In addition, the boxer-stalker character is NOT humorous in the slightest and the voice mail rape scene was enough to make me stop reading immediately.I was looking for a fun, light read and got an annoying piece of trash.
Implausible Plum: I didn't like this book. I didn't hate it by any means--I thought it was good enough--but I did not like it. The characters were kind of fun, and it was an easy read. It was also a bit of a page-turner. On the other hand, the main character was utterly and unbelievably dense. I saw nothing romantic about Joe, a guy who molested Stephanie when she was six and took her virginity at eighteen (then never talked to her again and spread rumors about it). I, personally, would probably not make-out with a child molester/player/murderer (but I guess that's just me). Also, were a known rapist and sexual torturer calling me regularly to tell me he was going to rape me, I probably would call the police and not spend all my time alone. Stephanie Plum did the opposite, and somehow the rapist decided not to rape her on her daily early morning jog . . . alone. In short, the book had mostly implausible characters.
AMAZING READ!!: Must read!! Book I just could NOT put down! The movie is coming out in Jan 2012 and I will be first in line to see! I cannot wait for the next book in this series. I could easily give up t.v if all books were this great!
Stephanie Plum, No 1: Very entertaining, extremely witty and so amuzing. The entire family and my freinds enjoy reading her books. I now have the complete collection.
Entertaining!: I started reading this book/series on the recommendation of a friend and was immediately hooked. The characters were funny and entertaining, even if they weren't entirely believable at times. The main character, Stephanie Plum, is a regular girl who finds herself needing a job, and so she goes to work for her cousin as a bounty hunter. She's not anything like the bounty hunters you see on TV. She's completely inept but extraordinarily lucky. The things that happen to her are outrageous and hilarious. It's a good, lighthearted read when you're in the mood for a good chuckle. In fact, the first eight or so in the series are terrific. After that, they start to decline, but don't let that deter you from reading the first several books. Definitely read a sample of this one and you'll see what I mean about entertaining.
Plum Force One: Worth reading. Written in 1994 so the technology is dated some now. I think some of the one-star votes are off base. I think the point of the violence against women in the story was to show how far over her head Plum is. Fun to see her get herself out of the tough spots with no real experience. I like how she took the big bad world of Jersey and turned it into her little neighborhood. Running into old high school buddies at just the right time to move the story along. Plum seems to pick things up quickly so I'm looking forward to giving the series another shot.
Wait for the movie then go see something else: Poorly written and entirely predictable. I could not wait to put it down and regret ever picking it up. The book back cover reads better than the book.
Evenovich: One for the Money: This was purchased as a gift, so I have no idea at all of the content or interest, or anything else about the book. It did arrive here, however, in excellent condition.
One felon chases another: This book was the worst I've ever read. The main character is just a self-interested person who thinks nothing of comitting felonies. It is amazing that Morelli, the man she is after, falls for her. She would sell him out for a dime, yet he finds her irresitable. She judges all these criminals as getting what they deseve, but thinks nothing of comitting crimes herself. The fact that such a self-interested person is the heroine is a sad commentary on our times.
If you have nothing better to do read this book: I got this book as a birthday present. I like reading spy novels. So, the crime novel came as something I was willing to try. Well, if you like easy read, this is a book for you. I was clearly disappointed. The main character, who normally reads only "funnies" form the daily paper, uses unexpectedly word such as inconspicuous, while at the same time using word curiouser?! Also, what annoyed me is that her best friend, the cop and friend married to her cousin, has "eastern Slavic" features, like there are "western Slavic" features, only we did not know about them? Anyone who likes loud mouth New Jersey girls with no style, or manners would truly enjoy this piece of trash. I cannot even imagine donating this book to anyone. It would be too embarrasing to even admit that I had it in my possesion at one time or another.
Completely DISGUSTED: I am reading the reviews full of praise for this book. Honestly, it was entertaining....until you get into the racism in this book. Note how many times the author refers to the latino or black characters as ghetto, poor, criminal, etc. Time after time, she takes the opportunity to paint a one sided picture with this novel. It is full of ebonic slang and blatant racism. I expected an entertaining mystery book. Never did I think I would be offended by a book. If the book was about issues of race, then the racist referrences would not mean anything. But in a regular book about a bounty hunter?????????
didn't get the books: My mother in-law has not gotten the books yet. I have read them all and they are FANTASTIC what a ride.
Good story and funny dialogue but too much violence.: She is a good writer with good story line. The characters are good with funny dialogue. The violence and sometimes off color language are not needed. This was the first book. I had heard good review about the series but I was disappointed.
a plus: I have read all twelve of these books and hoping there will be more. The language is pretty graphic but they are so funny you can usually ignore those words. These books can cause you embaesment, since I read where ever I have to sit and wait and you burst out laughing people do stare and wonder if you are losing it. Please we would all like to see more of these
My New Favorite Author: This is the beginning of Plum series about a Trenton NJ girl looking for a job and find herself employed as a bailbonds man. She has two men in her life a old lover and hunky cop and quiet man with lot of secrets and they both make you weak in the knees. You will be hooked after this book - enjoy !
First One is Definitely Fun: I read the 8th book first and according to reviews it was not as good as the rest of the series. But after reading Book 1, I'm having a hard time picking my favorite. Grandma Mazur was definitely not as flamboyant but it was nice to see a different side of Morelli and to be introduced to Vinny, Connie, Lula and Ranger. A great start - I'm ready to dive into Book 2.
Stephanie Plum is a Fun and Interesting Bounty Hunter: Stephanie Plum is a fun heroine with guts, a good sense of humor, and easy to identify with. The story is cute, well-written and a good page-turner.Stephanie Plum loses her good white-collar job in retail and becomes a bounty hunter for her sexually deviant cousin Vinnie. Enter Morelli the cop, the bail skipper she's out to catch. They have some interesting history from high school days that livens things up. The book takes place in New Jersey.This is a good page-turner and a perfect beach, plane or vacation book.
Fluffy Fun: I remember first reading ONE FOR THE MONEY about ten years ago, and finding it a very enjoyable, light-hearted read. I re-read the novel recently, and my current reaction is pretty much the same. This book is good, mindless fun.This is the first of the "Stephanie Plum" books that feature the adventures of a cute, slightly ditzy 30-year old bounty hunter in New Jersey. These books are best known for their first rate comic dialogue, but Evanovich is also a deft plotter, and keeps the action moving in this installment. Plum is definitely a plucky, likable heroine, and it's hard not to root for her as the story progresses. Overall, I very much enjoyed this novel, which is short enough to enjoy in an afternoon.Evanovich is pretty much one of the most successful fiction writers in existence, and this is the novel that started it all for her. If you've never tried a Plum novel, and are looking for some laughs, I encourage you to give ONE FOR THE MONEY a try.
VERY QUICK, INTERESTING AND OFTEN FUNNY READ...: I liked the wise-cracking main character and I'm very happy that I started reading this series from the beginning. I definitely look forward to reading the entire series. One aspect of the book that's interesting reading in 2008, the book was written in 1994, is that you can anticipate the growth in the story-lines as Stephanie (the main character) incorporates more technology and modern conventions in her crime solving.As for the book I really enjoyed the writing style and story-line. Although there were quite a few implausible plot-points they didn't detract from the entertainment value of this book at all. I was surprised at the number of times that I caught myself laughing out loud at the reactions that Stephanie has to the different situations that she's in from family matters to being poor to learning how to be a bounty hunter. I would recommend this to anyone who wanted a fun, quick read with a good story attached to it.
expected fun and sassy....not stupid: My sister raved about this series so I picked up the first book as a 'tester'. Given the multitudes of rave reviews, I expected something much better. I had never read anything by this author beforehand, and it's highly unlikely that I'll read any more in this series. I'm not much into sexist violence, and I'm certainly NOT into stupid women who can't think their way out of a cardboard box. Stephanie Plum seemed to constantly blunder into situations that anyone with an ounce of brains would avoid or solve positively. It's just plain STUPID. I'll leave this series to those who enjoy it....but that doesn't include me. And I do read the occasional 'chic lit' book....Jodi Picoult, Elin Hilderbrand, Jennifer Weiner...but this book doesn't even come CLOSE.Not sure why this isn't coming up as an amazon verified purchase: I bought the kindle version (scratching head)...
One for the Money: This book is lite and fluffy. Enjoyable but no real substance. Good beach read. Characters are interesting but not real.
Predictable: The biggest problem that I have with this book is that it is predictable. Even though the writing is good and keeps me somewhat interested, I was bored because I kept guessing what was going to happen next.
FUNNEEEE: Enjoyable read. Worth the time for a good beach read. Glad it was loaned to me. I wouldn't have purchased it since I am not one for mystery "chick flicks". I've read this one but likely won't read another - too silly. But if this is your cup of tea, I recommend it.
So Fun: Oh my goodnes....Stephanie Plum, I love you. I usually read historical fiction and tried this book based on a Pinterest suggestion. I devoured it in 5 hours then checked my windows and doors twice before going to bed. This is laugh out loud funny. I enjoyed Stephanie's wacky grandmother and the tension between Stephanie and Morelli. I can't wait for book two. It's like a new guilty pleasure. So fun.
A fun read: Fun and easy going. Graphic where appropriate but not overdone. I got a good sense of the characters immediately. The author's descriptions are very good.
Terrific, quick read!: Hilarious! I read it in one sitting, laughing out loud many times! I saw the movie first so I could picture Jason O'Mara as Joe, which made the book even better!
Not the greatest mystery writer: This was the first Evanovich mystery I read, having only recently come to mystery book from literary fiction. The story was only mildly interesting to me and I much prefer other mystery authors.
Stephanie Plum series: I love the Stephanie Plum series of novels. I really hate reading so I purchase them both in audio for me and paperback for houseguests and friends. I'm drawn in with the excitment and adventure of the story that Janet seems to capture in every novel. It has twists, turns, Lula, mystery, wonder, and of course two very "HOT" men! Who wouldn't want a mix of both men. :} I would recommend the "Plum" series, her "Full" series, as well as her earlier novels of mixed titles. They're all great fun and keep you as a reader at the edge of your seat waiting to see if a cars going to get blown up, who's died this week, who attends the pot roast dinner, who she sleeps with next, what will burn down next, and will she get her man (love or bounty). I hope you enjoy them as much as I have. I look forward to #14 in the "Plum" series, the next "Full" novel, and the new novel Janet recently wrote with a new author being released this October. Thank you!
A Fun Read: I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Stephanie Plum is a fun character who makes you laugh and entertains you with her antics. She is surrounded by a cast of characters that endear themselves to you. I was hooked after this first book and plan to read the rest of this series.
One For The Money: Per my mothers suggestion, I bought the 1st book of the series. She enjoyed the Stephanie Plum series and so far I've purchased the first 4 books. I like how the stories grow and add characters along the way. It's not brain surgery but it is an escape. Keep 'em coming cuz ill be to the 19 book by the end of the summer.
I can understand some of the 0 reviews...: "One for the Money" is harder-core than Janet's later stuff, and, frankly, it's not my favorite because of the level of violence, both to Lula and the poor, old, neglected dog. I can also see a bit of the race stereotype complaints people have, although I can assure them that lightens in later books. With all that said, the series is still my favorite because it's best described as "sexy and funny." It's not highbrow stuff, and some people, including my mother, are put off by the language, so be aware...
BEST SERIES EVER!!!: These Stephanie Plum novels, the first one being One for the Money, are the best set of books I have ever read. I was advised by a friend of mine that I would like these books. They combine both the fun and mystery of crime solving and the twists and turns of a romantic plot. I can't get enough of them. I have read all the way through High Five, the fifth installment, in less than four weeks. They are just plain fantastic. If you want the thrill of crime and mystery, sidelined by a reoccuring romantic theme and topped with laugh out loud moments including a transvestite, an "enforcer", a mortitioner, and a midget - these are the books for you. Stephanie Plum is my hero.
Too much violence against women: I had no idea that this book contained so many graphic depictions of violence against women -- I was truly surprised. I had to quit about half the way through. I am a fan of the Kinsey Millhone mysteries by writer Sue Grafton. I was on the wrong track thinking this would be similar! I am just not entertained by descriptions of trussed-up women and brutal, bloody sexual violence. Ugh.
Hilarious: I've read more books than I could ever count, and no book has made me laugh more and harder than this series by Evanovich. I actually fell off my bed laughing. The main character, Stephanie Plum, is someone everyone can relate to. She is quirky, clumsy, how-many-more-cars-can-I-go-though, man-(oops, men-) problems, just-lost-my-job-now-I've-got-to-get-help-from-my-family type of person. And talk about crazy family. Trust me, you'll love them. She also has a wonderful website....
Laugh out Loud Hilarious!!!: A friend of mine recently recommended this book to me and I have to say that he has excellent taste in books. This book is so funny and the characters are engaging. A great read!
Laugh until you cry!: A friend had recommended this title to me. At first I thought it would be just another police/mystery story so it took me a while to even check it out here at amazon and read some reader's reviews. I finally ordered the first book, One for the Money. I think I was on the 10th page or so that I realized that I would definitely need to have the next few titles waiting in the wings! What a wonderful read! Not only is it a book that doesn't require alot of concentration, but it actually made me laugh out loud! Any author that can make me laugh so hard that tears are brought to my eyes, is worth their weight in gold. Needless to say that I have purchased every title available to date!
A heartwrenching story of forgiveness: Deb Raney has a way of gripping you by the throat with emotions and literally transporting you into the lives of her characters. After the Rains is her best yet and showed the way it's so hard to forgive ourselves for our sins. I lived every page with the characters. You've got to read this one!
Peter and His Magic Bedtime Cap: Wow, how touching! This book is written from such an empathetic standpoint. The author regonizes the pain children experience from illness, yet offers each child a beacon of hope--excape through the power of your imagination. It is beautifully illustrated and the words seem to roll off my tongue as I read them to my children. Neither of my children are sick, but I believe the book teaches a lesson which transcends cancer (as the author implies) or any illness. It tells children that they always have the tools to cope through the power of their imagination. Cudos to the author for teaching children such a complex lesson with such simplistic words. Highly recommended!
Excellent, very moving, captivating: The Intense Measures CD certainly dispels the myth that the only good composer is a dead composer. Brian has done an excellent work with his newest CD. I highly recommend purchasing and listening to this CD. I hope he continues to produce more of his compositions.
Great Lights!: The lights came very quickly! I installed them and they are exactly what I was looking for!
GLOVES - sizes listed are very small: Youngstown Waterproof Winter Gloves - Unisex Sizing - Free ShippingThese gloves run a size or two smaller than listed. I ordered size extra large, a size I normally wear, and can barely get the gloves on my hands. I kept them because it is to much trouble to return them. I would not recommend them unless you have small hands and order ertra large..
A Good Glove but.......: This an excellent work glove, sturdy, comfortable and waterproof, but.....as has been pointed out in previous posts, this is not a glove for extreme cold. It does a good job until temperatures drop into the mid to low 20's. At that point my old fingers start complaining. Anything below that and I'm numb within minutes. Luckily, where I live that doesn't happen often. For most winter days it is a near perfect glove. But if you deal with extreme temperatures on a regular basis, look elsewhere.
Valogo: I wasnt happywith my gloves , besides that they arent water proof like it saidthey was , but trying to put them on was tricky most of the time because of the inner glove would come out in the glove an the fingers wouldnt line up which became a pain . i still have them sumwhere but im looking for a new pair to buy . an not this one .
Defeats Its Purpose: I'm 7 months pregnant and bought this pillow a few weeks ago. I couldn't sleep at all. It's small, hard, and the wedge does nothing for me (I'm just under 5 feet tall so it's small for a petite person...not good). I just use a regular, soft, standard pillow for my mid-section, and I sleep through the night easily.
like sleeping with a brick: at ten bucks it's so cheap I thought it'd be worth a try, and it's teeny compared to the body pillow I've been using- but ouch!!! it's like putting a triangular shaped brick under my hip. I didn't think sleeping in the third trimester could get any LESS comfortable ... until I purchased this atrocity.
Smaller than I imagined: I bought this pillow and from the looks of the picture I imagined that it would be much larger pillow. But when I recieved it, it was very small incline. Maybe only a couple inches. Very upset, easy return!
Waste of money: This pillow was a waste of money.I could not use it for my belly or between my legs. It's so tiny, my full length body pillow from Bed, Bath and Beyond has been much more helpful, I even bought two! I'm 9 mo. along and still have not found use for the pregnancy pillow deluxe.
Keep on searching: This pillow was a waste of money and did not provide the much needed support that my tummy needs at this point in pregnancy. Save your money!!
yea right: i decided to buy this because of the great reviews but i got fooled this product was awfull it was a pillow for a pet rather then someone expecting i hated it...
I thought it would be larger...: Being pregnant -- I was looking for a larger, softer memory foam-type pillow. It's small, and hard, and may make a good foot rest...? but I'm not impressed.
Pregnancy Wedge Pillow: I found that this pillow was not soft enough to adjust to the weight of my pregnant stomach, so as I leaned into it on my left side at night I felt it lifted me way too much and I could not really adjust it.I also tried it behind my back just to help me not roll around in the bed that is a better use for it I guess but would not buy it again.
My bad: I thought it was bigger. I wanted it to prop myself up when on my back. I should have looked at the size before ordering.
Too hard!: I had a wedge pillow similar to this one my previous pregnancy that was perfect, but lost it along the years. I thought this was the same but it's not- I simply cannot stand using it, it's so hard it actually hurts my belly. Not worth the trouble to return it for 10 bucks; will see if anyone else can 'stomach' it.
This pillow helps: This pillow does help when your belly feels heavy and pulls when you are trying to rest on your side. I have trouble sleeping with it for some reason although the bigger I get the more helpful it is. I need more support than just for the belly so I have preferred sleeping with a body pillow. I was a bit disappointed with how small it is. I was hoping that it would be wider so that I could use it to sleep off center on my back as well. But it is helpful and every bit of help makes a difference!
My standard pregnancy gift: I loved this pillow when I was pg! I even took it to the hospital with me and used it while I was in labor. Such a relief. It supported my huge belly perfectly. I even recommend buying two, one for between your knees.I either give this to or recommend this to all of my newly pg friends! My friend is now pg with twins and loves this pillow! Looks are deceiving, it was a lifesaver!
Perfect belly support with room in the bed!: I started using this pillow around the 4-5th month of pregnancy because my back would hurt as my stomach hung over while I slept on my side. This gave the support that allowed my stomach to not pull down on my back, which made me very comfortable. I continued to use it through out my pregnancy and it really helped. What was wonderful about it is that it gave support, but it still left room for my husband in bed! The only thing that kept it from being 5 stars is that by the 9th month, the narrow end of the pillow began to flatten and slightly curl, but not enough to make it uncomfortable if I remembered to flip it over each night.
NOT What I Expected: The pillow is too small, I tought it was bigger. After a couple of days of use it started to loose its firmness and now after a month of use it is basically starting to look flat. I don't recomend it.
Excellent value for the money: This has been such a help. I would take with a grain of salt the review below that claims using this product was like "putting a triangular shaped brick under my hip" -- this person was obviously using it incorrectly, because it doesn't go under your hip. When placed correctly under your belly, it precisely reverses the anatomical physics that cause your back to hurt while sleeping during pregnancy (torque of the belly area while the hips and shoulders try to stay aligned).While I agree it could be a little wider, it is a terrific value. Its small size has been nice in that it makes it a lot easier to roll over and re-position the pillow on the opposite side.
Very small: When ordering this pillow, I thought it would be one of those hospital grade wedge pillows. When it got here, and I opened it, I found a little tiny wedge pillow, not really good for anything.
Not a great purchase: Not helpful once I really got big. Actually, once I got showing at all it didn't help. I am not comfortable in any position.
Totally Worthless: There is no point in using a pillow this small for support, you might as well use a folded up towel and save yourself ten dollars plus freight.
disapointing: This pillow is super tiny and a big disappointment.It does not provide adequate support or relief from the discomforts of pregnancy. I feel like I was mislead and I wasted my money.
Waht would I do without it?: This is a great pillow that allows me to be more comfortable at night. Because of it's shape it isn't too big or small. The reason it did not get 5 stars is that the skinny edge looses it's shapea little. I'm sure it is because I "shove" it under my belly 100 times a night.
Doesn't feel comfortable: I tried the wedge under my belly (24 weeks pregnant) and didn't like how it felt. The foam is too firm and doesn't mold well under my body. The fabric was soft enough, but I wish the velcro opening in the back edge was a covered zipper instead. Now, I use a regular body pillow with a cover that I got cheap ($20) at Target, and I love it! Helps me sleep so much better, and the pillow is soft enough to squish under my belly and between my legs. I didn't want to get one of those expensive pregnancy body pillows. For me, this solution has worked perfectly for side sleeping during pregnancy.
Not wedge I had in mind.: I was looking for a sleeping wedge for gastric acid. This was good price ,but did not have product size. So I made a mistake. Guess it is good for what it says it is.
Ineffective and uncomfortable: This pillow not only doesn't help me find any comfort while I try to sleep, but the hard foam material also makes my pregnant belly or back hurt. Would not recommend this to anyone.
Not impressed..quite uncomfortable.: I bought this wedge as my stomach started getting bigger to find some comfort sleeping at night. The wedge is very stiff, even after working it for a little while. The angle of it isn't right..it should be thicker at it's current thinnest part, because basically, my belly just pushes into it, and it falls on the floor, eventually. It was a waste of money, and a rolled up blanket or pillow does the job way better, and they are way more comfortable!
DEX wedge: This convenient wedge pillow is resonably priced. It really helped my wife during her pregnancy to alleviate a lot of pain from stretching, cramping, and movement. Plus, the foam cushioning on the inside of the pillow conforms to about every position imaginable. This fact made it versatile as a either a cushion or a pillow for many other purposes including resting, sitting, and driving just to name a few (so much in fact we bought another).
Too firm!!!: I purchased this product because I'm 5 months with my 2nd baby. I wanted a firm pillow but this was way too firm! It made my ribs hurt. I exchanged it for the boppy pregnancy wedge. It was only $3 more and it works great!!!
Not impressed with pregnancy wedge: I bought this wedge pillow in my third trimester and used it for 3 nights and will now be returning it. I bought it due to back pain while sleeping. My back pain was definitely worse after the 3 nights I used this pillow.
what a rip off: My caring husband bought this for me when I was 6 months pregnant. I think that the pillow is too small and is very cheaply made. I am now 3 weeks away from giving birth and the pillow is almost flat. I am only 160 lbs., 5 ft. 6, and don't consider myself a big pregnant person. It is made for small people (maybe 5 ft and under??) and I don't recommend it. It gives no support. Just get a body pillow.
very small: It is very small, I thought it would be larger. If I use it behind my back it digs into my lungs. Spend more money and get a larger one.
Do not buy this product: I bought this pillow to support my belly in my third trimester because not supporting it was causing my back to ache during the day and night. I used it the first night and it made my back ache worse. It is hard and does not support at all. The small size does little to help either. I would suggest a foam pillow which contours to your belly.
Great Pillow: I was searching for pregnancy pillow for my last trimester, but why spend more then $50. I was very surprised by the price but I thought why not to try. It's a grate pillow. I use it when I lie on a couch to watch TV, its great during the night when you switch sides. And its perfect size to elevate belly and be comfortable. I love it and would really recommended to anyone who wants restful night.
I love this pillow!!: This pillow helped me through my first pregnancy and sleeping. Now I am pregnant with my second and that is the first thing I looked for when I found out I was pregnant. It fits comfortably while you are sleeping all the way through your 9 months!! I highly recommend this pillow!!!!
Good product-but give yourself a few days to adjust to it: I got this because I was looking for an alternative to sleeping with 4-5 pillows. Since I felt the Snugli body pillow was way to big I gave the Dex a shot after reading the reviews. The first two nights I wasn't very impressed and almost gave up on it. Two things really helped me in utilizing it. First, I think it needs a few days to be broken in. To do this I used it when on the couch when reading or watching TV as well as when sleeping. Second, I also think it helps to lean on it more than lie on top of it. There are no specific instruction on the box, but for me it was uncomfortable if my side was actually on the pillow. If I lean on it I am not using much of the pillow surface, but the support is helpful. As far as using it between your legs, I found this very uncomfortable. For me, a regular pillow works much better.
Very helpful: I loathe sleeping on my side and this pillow is the only thing that makes it bearable. I tried those big body pillows but they were complete overkill. Not only were they too soft but they were entirely too large and cumbersome for our queen-sized bed. My husband said it was like having three people in the bed. This pillow, however, is small and effective. It takes the load off my belly and hips. My pelvic bones are separating and this pillow really gives me relief. As an added bonus, I don't have to spend five minutes unentangling myself from a monster pillow (while trying not to wake my husband) every two hours to go to the bathroom.
Awsome Gift: My gift was a hit and the family member due couldn't wait to try it out. I'm glad everyone was happy!!
Not a Wedge to Put under a pillow: This wedge is very small, it will work well for supporting a pregnant belly but is not for sleeping on. I was disappointed that it was so small and firm.
Extremely firm: This item is extremely firm almost cardboard-like. I won't be using this item in my last 2 trimesters of pregnancy.
Ouch. This pillow is HARD.: Don't waste your money. This pillow is hard and doesn't do the job right. Constantly I was finding myself re-adjusting to try and get comfortable with it the few nights I tried to use it. If you were going to think you're saving money by using something like this, you'll find that a folded towel or even old feather pillow works wayyyyyy better.
Not worth it: The picture made this look bigger than it was. It is small and does little to assist in making you comfortable. If I could find the receipt, I would send it back. The pregnancy pillows are much better and can be used for so much more.
Great product!: This pillow helped my friend sleep through-the-night by taking off some pressure from her "baby belly." Since her daughter was born almost 1 1/2 years ago, she has lent it to several other friends while they were pregnant. She can confidently lend the pillow out to others, thanks to the removable/washable cover- completely hygenic! In fact, I had to buy my own, because hers was lent out to another pregnant friend!
Rush to publish!: Although the book is readable and avoids the geekspeak often found in programming books, there are too many glaring errors in this first edition. If you precisely follow the instructions, even the universal "Hello World" program does not work. True , you only have to change a tab index number to zero but nothing of this is mentioned and an "absolute beginner" will find this frustrating. There are multiple other errors and omissions that lead one to believe that there was a rush to get this book out there first. I would suggest waiting for the second edition or purchasing a book that has been proofread more closely.
Disappointed student: I am currently a student in a C# programming class. Students were required to purchase this book as the textbook for the class. I am only in the second week of the class and the instructor has had to give us copious amounts of supporting material to help us understand how to use C# because this "textbook" is lacking. You would think, and it makes sense to do so, that the author would start with the basics, such as defining terms that are not layman's terms, or using diagrams to show the reader where to look to find all of the things she is talking about (instead of images of screenshots with no arrows anywhere to guide your eyes). I am already frustrated with having to use this book and it is making me worry about my grade. How can the reader create a program on his/her own if he/she does not know HOW to use the tools. The author basically tells you: "Put this here...type that...press the play button." The user is supposed to understand the fundamentals from that?!
Avoid this book beginner: As an experienced C programmer, I was very disappointed in the lack of attention to detail that the programming examples display. The amount of errors are abundant (out of bounds indexes, case sensitivity, spelling, etc) and MANY of the examples will not compile as written in the book. This book was used in an introductory C# class and I've spent more time debugging the books errors then I could have produced as a complete programming novice. I would pursue an alternative guide to programming in C# if your thinking of purchasing this book, it was definitely rushed for publication with little to no proofreading or editing in my opinion. Details matter in an absolute beginner book.
Ridiculous: This book is ridiculous for a beginner. There are so many errors the poor beginner will be scratching their head more than learning.
Not encouraging review: Not a good book for c# beginer! I wish i can give 0 star. Anisha, thank god amzon has 1 star as minimum rating..
*The* history to read of Imperial Spain: At the start of the period covered in Mr. Elliott's book, Spain was a divided backwater unsure of itself. By the book's middle, the country is the colossus of the world, already showing decline but still solid. How did this come about? John Elliott shows you how. The corrosive internal factors that precipitated the decline-- the inflation from the New World precious metals, the overreaching that stretched the state across an empire beyond its capacity to control-- all are studied here in the most remarkable and insightful detail.
Des heures de plaisir pour les amoureux de l'Espagne: Un des meilleurs livre que j'ai lus sur cette priode de l'histoire qui a vu l'Espagne partir de presque rien pour devenir la plus grande puissance mondiale. Passionnant non seulement pour mieux connatre l'histoire de ce pays fascinant, mais aussi pour comprendre l'Espagne d'aujourd'hui. ? lire absolument!
excellent history of culture and politics: I bought this after seeing the Met HD broadcast of the opera Don Carlo, in order to separate Verdi's and Schiller's version of history from a contemporary account.It helped me immensely, both with Verdi and with remembering my Cervantes and Lope de Vega in Spanish class with my favorite High School teacher, Dr. Beltran.
Recommend for new Javier Solis fans: Contains all the great JS music for new and old fans. This is a must for all fans of Mariachi music.
"The King of Romance" at his best!!!!!: I remember hearing this record, (Yes, I said record) playing over and over when I was about six years old. What I couldn't get over and still can't to this day is how such a little "Chaparrito" could have such a powerful voice. At times his voice is as light as a feather, but when he wants to get his point across, he comes across with a "QUE-AH!!!" and you know he means business. Every single song on this now cd is a classic. "Cuando calienta el sol" is so heartfelt, you damn near want to cry. "Tu Voz" makes you want to stand up and shout, while "Cada Vez" makes you smile. Period. I've mentioned just a few of the songs on this classic treasure. Romance galore on this cd will put you in the mood. There comes along a cd every once in a while that just sticks with you for life. THIS is that cd. I am 31 now and it still brings me chills as much as it did when I was six.
a guidence for life: this book is stunningly encouraging.It taught me how to organize my life.But I do think Thoreau was overtly against modern utensils. In "Economics" he said it was no use to have phones,railroads and stuffs alike.He had some good reasons,but the disadvantages cannot surpass the advantages of modern living styles
Fuel to re-kindle your expectations about life: I read most of Walden while backpacking the wilderness coast of Washington State alone. This was appropriate as the book is the author's account of two years spent largely by himself in a hand-made cottage on the edge of a pond. In it he details not only the minutiae of his solitary project, but opens into one of the heights of transcendental philosophy. I anticipated Thoreau's seminal work was powerful, but actually reading it was electrifying. No, I didn't agree with all of his positions. At times he turns tricks of hollow rhetoric though his arguments are nevertheless beautifully constructed. Over all, though, I came away changed and recharged to live a life more essentially meaningful; to simplify my day to achieve goals that last while experiencing as much as possible in every moment. My love of God and Creation were renewed. Classic.
Literary Brussels sprouts: This book is good for you, but it won't go down easy. Thoreau pales in comparison to European philosophers, and what he does have to say comes mainly in the concluding chapter, after two-hundred pages of self-consciously dense dawdling. I give it five stars in the same vein that Lawrence of Arabia is considered a classic: yes, it's undeniably a work of great effort and intelligence, but one viewing is enough. Civil Disobedience, considered a seminal political tract, struck me as anarchism-lite, written in a fit of pique. A good book to have read, but once you put it down, odds are you won't pick it up again.
Amazon Purchases August 9, 2007: This is a classic novel. It's value as literature speaks for itself.I received the product in the condition advertised, in two days.I am completely satisfied with the purchase and service.
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT: I'd give it 0 stars if that was an option! This pump is VERY painful (damaging in fact), has inconsistent suction, does not promote "let down", and is noisy. I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone! I purchased this pump before returning to work after the birth of my child. If this was the only product available to me, I would have stopped pumping after a week. I would recommend this product be permanently removed from store shelves!Consider purchasing a Medela Pump In Style instead. The Medela pump is well worth the investment.
Not worth the money: I purchased this pump hoping that I would be able to double pump during my lunch break at work. After only two weeks of pumping twice during an eight hour period, the pump quit on me. I called the company & they sent me an entire new pump. About four weeks later, I was only able to single pump & had to call the company again. They sent me just an arm replacement. It has been another four weeks & I have to call the company again for another arm replacement.Even though I have had problems with this pump, the company has been helpful enough in sending me replacement parts. But I wish I had not purchased this product.
Painful: This product was very painful. It took forever to get any milk out. It got to the point where my nipple got stuck in the tube due to thinking it was my fault why no milk was coming. I realized everything was poor working. I ended up returning the thing & using a manual single pump I received from the hospital & it worked like a charm.
Don't bother with this one!: I purchased this pump because it was the cheapest dual, electric pump I could find. Within 3 days, one of the arms was broken and the motorized pump wouldn't give enough suction to even use it on one side. The customer service people were very nice and sent a new one within 3 business days. However, after 2 months of fairly successful pumping (albeit, sometimes uncomfortable), I couldn't get my milk to let-down with this pump. After weeks of trying and only getting 1-2 ounces at each attempt, I broke down and got a hospital grade Ameda pump. The difference is amazing! Only 30 seconds on the new pump and my milk was flowing easily. The new pump is less portable but SO much more comfortable and efficient I'll never go back.
Highly Disappointed: I purchased this pump when my son was 5 days old. I didn't return to work until he was over three months old. As a result, I was beyond the company's return-by date. I used the product for approximatly one month before the suction on both sides went out. I did some research and decided to go with the more expensive Pump in Style, which, I might add, I have been extremely pleased with. After contacting the company, they advised me that I would not be able to get my money back, and would only be able to get a replacement pump instead. I was highly disappointed with the performance of this product, and will be staying away from this company's products in the future.
Buyer beware!!!!: Don't buy this product!!! It is extremely painful to use this pump on a regular basis and can harm your breasts, trust me spend the extra money for a good pump!!
Does not work well.: I bought this pump thinking that an electric one would be better than a hand pump and that a double one would also be faster to use. I was wrong. When I purchased this as a first time mother, I really did not know what to expect...I found it uncomfortable and after two weeks - one side broke. I received another one and in a month the same thing happened to the second pump...one side broke as well. I gave up on this pump and bought the hand held Advent Isis. I am so thrilled with the Advent hand pump - it is unexpectedly easy and comfortable to use. A good breastpump makes breastfeeding easier - get a hand pump.
AWFUL!!!: Follow everyone's advice and do not waste your money on this!!! It hurt me like crazy and I was lucky to get 1 ounce out in 15 minutes from both breasts. I would recommend the Isis, it's far better than trying to get this thing to work.
DO NOT BUY!: This was my first experiance with an electric pump, and was awful! The motor was very weak and it did not provide the proper suction. I called the company and told them of my complaints, they sent me a new motor and new washer rings (the rings in case the suction was being broken) however neither helped. This pump was loud, and painful and did not allow me to pump enough milk. The suction release is manualy operated but the motor could not keep up with the number up times I would need to relase per minute to simulate my baby's sucking, witch made let down even harder! I do not suggest to anyone to buy this product.
Painful and difficult to use: I bought this pump because of the low price. I wish now that I had invested the extra dollars and bought a Medela (the same brand the hospital had me use when I was hospitalized for a week at 4 weeks post-partum). Anyway, this pump doesn't suction well and it is extremely painful to use. After trying repeatedly to get it to work well, I gave up and used the hand Medela pump the hospital gave me to take home.
I do not reccomend this pump at all...: I thought that with it being a dual pump it would be faster....wrong. I only found it to be weak, painful and a little on the loud side. I ended up springing the money for a Medula and what a difference. Please rent a pump before you buy one so you can feel what a difference a hospital grade pump makes. If you are looking to pump only one bottle a week, then choose a manual hand pump (it's cheaper and doesn't hurt your tender breast).
not happy with: Aside from the noise it makes(like a cow) the pump is malfunctioming after 4 weeks of use. The on off button doesnt always work and it is losing suction and power. And since I can't find a 1 800 number for the manufacture, cant return it to the store of purchase( "sanitary reasons" ),and if i return it to the manufacture i have to get a replacement while this one is out of service, we have no choice but to mess with it ourselves. As a first time mom i prefer to give birth again than to try and use this pump at work , my only private place since the machine is so loud will be out in the car and hope that noone walks by. They need to have better customer support from this manufacture.
USELESS: This product is USELESS. IT is not customer friendly. I hate it and I cant believe I paid money for this. For the future MOM dont get this product it is a waste of money.
Not too great: I never could get both breasts situated for double pumping. Doing it single was ok but not good. I got better results with the manual pump they gave me for free in the hospital. It seemed better at causing let down which is crucial to a productive pumping experience. I would not recommend this pump at all.
The worst!!: This pump is terrible! The suction and motor started to fade out before my baby was 2 months old. It is also extremely painful. This is my first child and I had no comparison, but I soon realized it shouldn't hurt that much!! I hadn't even gone back to work yet. Spend the money on the expensive pumps, it is totally worth it!
waste of money: my grandmother bought this pump for me and not wanting to hurt her feeling i made up different reasons not to use it. its very loud, it pulls too much on the nipple, and u cant get the suction right, either its too much suction or not enuff. also i never could get the dual part goin on. the bottles moved around too much i could only get one seal at a time...it usually took about 1 hr to get 6 oz.now i'm about to spend tha money on a pump in style because it is 1 of 2 pumps rated for full time pumping. ...
Disapointed Mom: I purchased the Dual Breast Pump Kit by The First Years when I first had my baby. I didn't use it often & it worked ok cause I had the time. When I went back to work I took me over 30 minutes to pump 6 oz. and the motor started rattling louder. I got it out quicker by hand! With the design it sucks milk into the motor & causes it to go bad. My employeer was upset with the time I took & I was afraid I would be forced to supplement. Then I decided to go for a better product. I got the Pump-N-Style by Medela & LOVE IT! It gets 8 oz. in 10 minutes! I wrote First Years and told them how their product was faulty & they returned my money. I will by First Years again, just not their pumps. In the long run, [price] for a pump is not that bad to get a good one unless you have a lot of time on your hands.
Can't Decide: I have been reading the reviews for this product and am having a very hard time deciding if I want to buy it or not. The lady called "baby enthusiast" has me so confused. First she praises the pump and now she hates it. I am so confused by her statements that I don't know what to think or do about it any more. I guess she should make a final decision and stick to it before she reviews again.
Double isn't always better...: I've been using this pump for 6 weeks now and pretty much since day one, I've not been able to utilize the dual pump feature. If you have large breasts, it's VERY awkward regardless of the fact that it can move in many directions. The suction power was very good (at first) but I've noticed that it is losing that gradually! Not only is it losing the suction, one side has worse suction than the other. I'm still able to get milk out but I do wonder for how much longer. I really recommend going with a single pump if your breasts are cup D or larger. To be all fair, the bottles are great, the bag is somewhat cheesy, it does come with two different nipple adapters, and one cold pack.
not very durable: I loved it at first. It worked great. But after 3 1/2 months it just stopped working. It would be on but with no suction. I don't know why it just stopped working, I need to see if its still under warrenty. Maybe its just a fluke. Luckily a friend of mine gave me her Medela "Pump in Style". If you can afford the expensive Medela get it rather than take a chance.
suction stuck: I wouldn't advise anyone to get this pump due to my experience with it. I tried using it twice, for one I dont like the suction it was a constant pull on my nipples. The second time I gave it a try it had pulled my nipples all the way through the chamber till my nipples were sticking out of the other end. It wounld not release me even when I turned it off. The baby was crying and I was crying running around the house looking for something to get these cups off my breast. I finally had to get some cooking oil and a sink of warm water. After that you can say i was swollen and sore. I wasted no time getting rid of that suction trap. PLEASE not go through what I did by getting this pump. You do better with hand expresstion, trust me I am.
Works Great: This pump is the best one I have ever tried. I highly recomend this one.After four children I needed a new one. I wish I had this from the begining! It works faster with the dual action, is very durable and is more comfortable than the others. The price makes this product a GREAT value. It's worth a lot more!
Three hands would possibly make this work: After my first portable breast pump died I decided to try this one because I liked the idea of saving time with the double pumping option. I found that not only was the suction not as strong with this model, but it would take at least three hands to use the double pumping option. Perhaps I am simply uncoordinated, but it seems that I was only able to get both to work for a minute or so, before I would make a small move and would have to spend another 5 minutes trying to reposition. Once I was able to get things working properly I found it to be a painful experiance. I DO NOT recommend this for any person who has large breasts or is not a contortionist.
PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!: If only I had read these reviews before spending money on this breast pump! I would give it 0 stars instead of 1 star if it was possible. The motor is loud and the breast pump feels more like a torture device. My nipples have never been so sore! I bought this for use with my first baby and had no idea what breast pumps were supposed to feel like. After the pain that this machine caused me, I went and bought a [inexpensive] manual pump because I knew it wouldn't suck my nipples through the bottle! Don't waste your money like I did! I should have done a lot more research before buying this horrible pump.
I Loved this Pump: Well, although most of the other reviews on this product are pretty bad, surprisingly, I loved this pump. The price was excellent. Under $60. It provided dual pumping and wasn't too noisy for me. It did have a "humming" sound and is not as quiet as it's more expensive counterparts, but when I returned to work and went into the bathroom to pump, I had no problem letting my co-workers know what the humming sound was that they were going to be hearing. I returned to work 4 weeks after my baby was born, worked 3 twelve hours shifts a week, and nursed until she was 10 1/2 months old. The pump lasted the entire time. Now, it did start to have some problems near the end. I had to hold it just right in order for it to work, but it still worked. For less than $60, it was an excellent pump, and I'm planning on buying another one for my next baby who is due in August. (Unless I can find a used Medela on-line for a decent price...smile.)
Horrible for large chested women: I am well endowed, and the design of this pump does not work for me. The bar that connects the two pumps does not allow for the pumps to connect with both breasts properly unless the user is a contortionist. Do not buy if you are large chested!
Left a lot to be desired...: I purchased this dictionary for my daughter when she was in 2nd grade. There were a lot of words that were not in her dictionary that were a part of the 2nd grade curriculum for our county here in Florida. She would ask me what a word means and I would tell her, "I just bought you a dictionary, so go and look it up." Well, she did and more times than not, the words were not there. So I ended up going to a local used book store to purchase her a dictionary. This was a disappointing purchase because she excitedly picked it out online and it did not serve her purpose.
Author is definately Anti-Christmas!!!: I couldn't believe I saw this as the definition, and of course I was reading it aloud to my child.Look up the word "SPACE" in the dictionary! There are so many ways you can define "space". The author, Judith Levey, gives this definition: (A space is any area that is not filled with something. Mom hid the Christmas presents in a space at the back of her closet).Unbelievable. Yes...its 3 days before Christmas, and I do have presents hidden in my closet. Way to kill the spirit!
Where is the zero star option: I am using this book as part of course curriculum and I am sad to say that this has to be without a doubt the worst computer book I have ever read. Reading this book makes my eyes want to bleed it is so bad.It glosses over topics such as arrays, classes & class interaction and only briefly mentions recursion. Add to that the fact it does NOT even cover multi-dimensional arrays or any type of dynamic data handling. How do I store data if I don't want to cap how much data can be entered?Not only is the information lacking it is poorly structured. It "covers" classes before it goes into selection ,repetition and arrays. This seems a little backwards to me.Avoid at all costs.
So Hard To Find A Thoroughly Good Programming Book: I am using this book for my online course, and while this book started out wonderfully, good explanations, definitions, etc. ,I am now on Chapter 8, and the more 'abstract' side of programming is very vaguely defined.I started off thinking this was a great book, and now I do not.
A Wonderful Romantic Romp!: Lori Foster does it again! This pair of tales lets us in on the lives and loves of the Sawyers family - first Annie Sawyers goes to great lengths to snabble the love of her life, Guy Donovan. An accident, medication and a romantic hideaway all help! Then her wandering brother Max is caught at last when Maddie Montgomery crashes into his door and his heart! These stories are deceptively simple yet carefully thought-out, and I became immersed quickly and easily in the lives of these people. The sensuality is deftly smoothed into the mix and there is always humor to be found - along with a truly delightful dog with an attitude!! Don't miss this great book - it'll be a definite addition to the re-read and lend to friends section of my shelves!!!
Strong beginning - after that just annoying: The book started out promising enough, but then it became more and more annoying. Especially the second part. It became boring too.I agree with one of the earlier reviews. She is just killing off too many people in that book. It becomes really annoying, almost ridiculous. In the end everybody is dead and all we read is how sad the main caracter is over and over. She is pretty much crying for half of the book anyway. Again: Annoying. For the last couple of chapters I wasn't interest enough anymore and just flew over the pages to get to the end. And that was annoying too.There are far, far better historical novels out there.
Glorified romance novel: As far as romance fiction goes, 'Through a Glass Darkly' should get five stars out of five. The wealth of heart-warming cliches and mind-numbing descriptive minutiae (replete with navel-gazing, philosophical extractions from the Bible and various English poets of the period) will satisfy the pickiest reader in that genre.If, however, you're looking for well-written historical fiction, this novel shouldn't get more than two stars, one for being fairly accurate in its description of the period, and the other one for ambition (that and the effort it took to type the manuscript.)
ONE OF THE BEST HISTORICAL FICTION (romantic) BOOKS!!: Through A Glass Darkly will take you to the splendors of a lost time!! Like all great historical fiction it is full of characters so compelling they create their own world!! This is a story of a great family ruled by a woman of extraordinary charms, beauty, power!! Do not miss this book or its sequel Now Face to Face!!
Great story: This was a great book in my view, it was not the typical Georgian era story where people meet, fall in love, make love, get married and... happy ending.This book is so different... I read through the seven hundred and some pages in only a couple of days, had such a hard time putting it down.If you like historical novels you will probably love this book.
through a glass darkly: ok, well good read, will all the emotions wrapped up in this romance story, I cried for lady, her heartbreak and life was something I do not think I myself could of handled, it kept you going through the whole book, love romance greed and sex of course i had to keep turning the pages to see what happened to everyone in the story, i wanted to see the happy ending so bad. it will keep you reading that is for sure. this is a adult romance story novel for sure. mid life adults could really relate to some aspects of family backgrounds for non functional families in this book for sure.
Could not sleep for reading this book....WONDERFUL: This book took me right into the early 1700's. I was never one for reading but i couldn't put this book down. I learned more about this time period than i did in highschool. The people in the book are so real its like they are a part of you. This author throws in so many twist that you are constantly being surprised. I doubt i will ever find another author that can hold my attention like Mrs. Koen has. This is a must read for any fan of the 1700's time period
a sweeping historical romance: not your usual cookie cutter romance. more along the veins of "gone with the wind." beautifully developed characters,slow but effective plot line. you are drawn into the story without realizing it. i couldn't put it down to finish the ending. really lovely novel.
Brilliant Historical Fiction: This is one of the best books I have ever read. I highly recommend it. This book will break your heart and make you jump for joy. Must read!
Its full of sex and should be rated R: This book comes with A LOT of good reviews. And I cannot deny that it is well written. The story follows a teenage girl whom I felt protective of and her mother whom I quickly felt sorry for. But the author put in more sex than was necessary. Simple allusions to it would have sufficed.The book reads slowly. It felt like it took along time to get to the first main event in the story. As to its historic nature, the author has pinned many details perfectly and she fills the story with facts and details that brings the story to life.
Disappointed: I had high hopes for this novel, but was left feeling depressed and unsatisfied. I like a book with characters that are more realistic and less perfect, but this book took it way to far; every character was corrupt. Even the young heroine gives up by the end. If you were as disappointed as I was, try reading The Bronze Horseman or Redeeming Love. Both historical novels are full of suffering and anguish, similar to this novel, but have better endings.
One of the best books!!!: This is very well written, I cried almost throughout the whole book. I have read many historical romance novels and this one seem to have it all. Romance, betrayal, love and more!I could not put this book down. Story line and characters are very good the only thing that I did not particularly like is the side stories of dreams or flashbacks that don't really pertain to the story or if they did they went to deep and off subject.
Annoying: This book was nothing more than annoying. The author's writing style was not bad, which is the only thing that allowed me to be able to finish the book. The majority of the characters are unlikable, the heroine in particular. She was nothing more than a whiny little crybaby. I won't be able to force myself to read the sequel. This book's style came across as more of a romance than an historical fiction novel. There is no possible way this book could ever compare to Gone with the Wind.
Over done and drawn out - disappointed: I love to read, but the author has over done it. It's too long and drawn out. There are too many things going on. The majority of the book, I skimmed over and just flipped pages. I was not impressed. I only read the entire book because I wanted to find out what happened to Barbra and Roger. There is way to much going on and a lot of useless information given. I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this book to any of my friends or family. I feel that the author should have focused on the 2 main characters and their story, but the author just goes into so much non-sense in the book and just draws it out. How this book is a "New York Times Best Seller" is beyond me. It's not that great. Choose for yourself how you feel. I chose this book because it had good reviews from people, but I don't think those were honest reviews.
Never ever pulled me in, but I kept thinking maybe it would...: The way this story is written is odd. I never felt a flash of anxiety, happiness, excitement, etc. It was just flat. The plot is what kept me reading because a great potential always seemed to be hovering around the next corner. The fights, the sex, the turmoil, and the sorrow were beyond confusing me with the authors inability to maker me FEEL any of these things. The book is in two parts and I found the transition any thing but seamless and compelling. Let me get to the point...I won't even be giving this author a second chance, it was that big of a let down. Two stars for the over all vision and idea of the plot.
Another Gone With The Wind, Forever Amber: Through A Glass Darkly is a book that will never leave you. The story is another one of those historical novels that makes you forget what century you are currently living in, not to mention you will find your self forgetting about your daily duties till you have completed this book. I highly recomend this soon to be classic and then pass it on to someone else! PS...Get ready for a plot that gives you such a surprise it will take your breath away.
In my top 10 list of favorite books.: I love books, but only a few more than I love this one. I just reread it for I believe the 6th time since it was first published. Although it no longer makes me cry as it did the first time, I am always misty. The only letter I have ever written to an author was to Karleen Koen begging for a sequal. Unfortunatly, the sequal is no near the triumph that this book is. If you haven't read it, you should. And if you know someone who hasn't read it, it makes a great gift. (everyone I've given it too has also loved it.)
Couldn't hold my interest: With about 100 pages to go, I just realized that I didn't give a darn about any of the characters or what happens to them. I just put the book down. I felt like it was mostly a waist of time. The characters are so UNLIKABLE!!! There is not one character in the book that had any redeeming qualities, they were all selfish and dull.
Beautiful, but sad: I was quite disappointed with this book. Having grown up reading Roberta Gellis historical novels, I guess I am spoiled. But this book seemed so determined to be sad and not allow the heroine to have any sort of happiness in her life. I read this book over the course of a week and when I was done, I threw it on the couch and wanted those hours back. If you want to read a story that ends with the happy movie ending, this is not the book for you. Bah!
Overrated: Koen did her research, and that's to her credit. But the plot was sluggish, the characters flat and I simply could not force myself to care. It was only by sheer force of will that I finished it at all. If you're really looking for a "fluffy" novel with plenty of melodrama, you might like this book. I, however, was searching for something with more meat to it...
Not for fans of historical fiction: I had seen this book on a list of recommended reading under the category, British historical fiction. The history is a backdrop; that is, the setting is the early 18th Century. But don't expect to learn much about the times.The author spends the first 200 pages on a marriage contract that ultimately fails. Why she takes 200 pages to get to the point is beyond me.I did get a good sense of the characters. So if you like character development and stories about family relationships, you might like it. What I read of the book resembled WIDEACRE by Philippa Gregory. But if you are looking for historical fiction, look elsewhere.
Bleh.: Based on the enthusiastic reviews, I was hoping for some substantive and entertaining historical fiction. This was "lite" and a little sleazy--more like standard romantic fiction with better costumes and marginally better writing.
Extremely disappointing: I'm an eternal optimist when it comes to books. I picked this one up at a bookstore, intrigued by the historical fiction aspect of it and that it was about a reign (King George I) that wasn't often written about. I also picked it because I love a good personal mystery, and all the characters were hiding something.This book was very disappointing, because it's barely historical fiction. I think the author used the setting more for the manners and clothes, rather than fully exploring the rich possibilities the era gave. The most disappointing aspect was Roger's "big secret," which is alluded to throughout the first half and is exposed in the second half. The secret is a terrible letdown, as most readers will guess it within the first few mentions. Moreover, the historical aspect regarding Roger's secret is totally ignored, and makes me wonder if the author did her research at all, or if she did research and just wanted us to put 20th century mores into 18th century characters

Truly a deep and meaningful book!!!: This is on my list of favorite books ever. I cannot recommend it highly enough. The writing is superb. The plot is interesting and well paced. The characters are unforgettable. I have read this book 5 times and I will read it more. There is always something new in it, something that hits me as relevant to my life, every time I read it. It is much more thought provoking than a romance, but it is romantic. It is more story- and character-driven than most historical fiction, but the author brings you into the world of the past and makes you feel you've experienced it for yourself. Buy it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
Great Historical Fiction: Karleen Koen does a great job of presenting a historical fiction novel in early 18th century London and Paris from 1715-1721. The story evolves around the central character, 15 year old Barbara Aderly. She is raised by her grandparents, the Duke and Duchess of Tamworth. Her mother is pretty useless and selfish, worried more about how she can get more money, boyfriends, etc. Her mother Diana has decided that Barbara should wed the much older friend of the family, Earl Devane.The story is full of duels, deception and romance. It is over 750 pages, but does not drag on. I thoroughly enjoyed the great descriptors of the homes and clothing of the era. There are many characters that you grow to love. Although some reviewers have lamented the ending, there is a great sequel Now Face to Face, which finishes up the details. However, I would recommend reading the prequel, Dark Angels, first so that you get to know the Duchess and keep the history in chronological order.
excellent read: This was a great story, I could not put the book down. I unknowingly read the prequel before I read this but it only made the story more enjoyable I think.
An unusual view of Ray Charles: Few artists have had such a long and varied career that a collection of this sort could fill even a single disc, let alone 4. But Charles has proven himself time again to be more than just a pianist, more than just a soul singer, more than just a songwriter. He is an artist who fuses a variety of sources into something that is uniquely his own.What's particularly interesting about this collection, drawn from a 28-year period, is the transition he makes. The early recordings take C&W songs and filter them through the jazz and soul stylings on which Charles made his name. The later recordings turn the formula inside-out, rearranging soul tunes with a C&W flair. Perhaps most impressive of all is that both work wonderfully.
Wonderful range of feeling, tempo, style, and sound.: After giving this set to my honey as a gift, we listened to all 4 CDs. We marveled at the incredible range of songs, from upbeat, almost jazzy ones, to tear-jerkers, to deep-down, heartfelt bluesy ones. Ray Charles has a magnificent style, and his treatment of the classics was unique. Excellent investment.
BROTHER RAY!: What can you say about Ray Charles? He is indeed a One of a Kind SUperstar&Legend.Styles Of Music are Just Labels.Music is Either Feeling or Not.Ray Charles Passed on all Levels.His Playing&VOice Shine Really Bright here.He is Truly a Special Artist.this is a Great COllection on this Amazing Genius.
3/4 TIME: Ray Charles: The Complete Country & Western Recordings 1959-1986This is a must have collection from Ray Charles. Though he's long passed away the music is so alive that you have the feeling he is just there with you in your living room. This is really a masterpiece of a genius production. Ray Charles has always been my idol but this collection has proved it. I knew some of the tracks on vinyl back then but thanks to Amazon I now have the full and complete collection on CD. God knows how many years I've been craving for this very collection from Ray Charles. I am really overwhelmed. I am really over the top about my latest find.
cute but on the smaller side: I bought this for twin five year olds and they love it. However, it runs a bit smaller than your average memory board. We have to print out pics in the 2x2 size to get them to fit into the squares. Since there is a bit of figiting to get the pic in, I'd not get this for kids younger than five if they are going to be the ones to put the pics in. Not sure how long it will last with little kids navigating the small pic space and ribbon holders. However, the items is quite cute and a nice touch for kids old enough to want some of their own choices on pictures hung in their room.
noam chomsky hates America: This book reek's. Right off the bat when the author is asked, did the attacks of 9-11 change the geopolitical scene? he just cant help his anti-american views, he spouts off how the U.S. annihilated million's of people, conquered half of mexico, conquered Hawaii and the Philippines killing hundreds of thousands of filipinos. He calls the U.S. a leading terrorist state. He goes on to call osama bin laden a {courageous fighter}If you love America skip this book!
hateful garbage: This is a spiteful, hateful man who is out of his element outside of linguistics. And he got that wrong, as well.
I found this book to be 'on the money' about 9-11!!: "a thought provoking and objective analysis of the causes and the effects of the events of September 11th that corporate controlled media is currently uninterested in providing" ---Ken
Careful: People need answers for problems they don't understand. They need comfort. Much of his factual information is incorrect, or at least estrimated wrong, but that's not the point. Why did he write it? Let's just put this succinctly.Chicken Soup For the American Soul this is NOT.
Worthless: All of Chomsky's work is worthless...Not because of a lack of thought but because of too much thought.He offers a single-minded attack with no realistic alternatives.When reading anything Chomsky writes, ask yourself what is the alternative - it is easy to attack any course of action (and the past behavior of any nation). The unfortunate truth is that even the best possible course of action may be successfully attacked:Until Chomsky begins to offer a realistic alternative along with his criticisms, his entire body of work will remain worthless.
Chomsky the chump: Chomsky once wrote that the spelling system of the Englishlanguage was "almost perfect." This from an "expert" on linguistics. You can imagine how shallow Chomsky becomeswhen he branches into areas like politics and others foreignto his area of competence, such as it is. I'm amazed anyonewould attempt to understand the events of 9/11 by reading thistransparently simple minded account. Chomsky hasn't a clue when it comes to the motives of the terrorists, which somehow get completely lost in his convoluted and confused accounting.But this book is all about getting to press early on to benefitfrom the notoriety. In other words, it's about greed, not tragedy.
ANTI-AMERICAN ...: In this book, rushed out after 9-11, Chomsky starts the process of blaming America for al-Qaeda's terrorism. This is not the work of an investigator analyzing facts, but rather a propagandist making a case and making up "facts" to fit.
Too bad you can't 0 stars: Let me see if I understand: The attacks of September 11 are justified because the CIA supported regimes that killed people half a century ago.I wish that Chomsky would join all the other far left idiots who are migrating to Canada because they can't stand to live in a country where the majority of voters have some semblance of morality
Self-citations- YEHHHH!: A booklet filled with typical Chomsky. Nothing is factual but there seem to be lots of citations that refer the reader back to some other Chomsky title which contains even more self-citing.How deep is the rabbit hole? Only Chomsky knows. I guess this is the trick of a learned linguist."The Anti-Chomsky Reader" is a must have accompaniment.PenetratingArmenianA Self Certified Blogspot BloggerPS-1 Star because it's dead cheap and brief.
Mindless crap: It's the same old anti-american propeganda. Chomsky tries to blame the terrorist attacks on everyone but the perpetrators.
Take it for what it is...: A set of interviews with Chomsky post 9-11. Its typical Chomsky... no better or worse than anything else with his name. As a result of the choppy structure, its a bit frustrating. The repetition of the questions (and subsequent answers) gives me a better appreciation for Chomsky's frequently insulting demeanor towards interviewers. A a result of its structure and relative short size, this book makes a good bathroom reader.
disappointed: Very disappointed with the book that I didn't even finish reading it. The book is more or less an interview with Chomsky. It really didn't offer any insight to 911 and it didn't offer anything new. I expected more out of this book and from Chomsky.
Different perspective for a TV viewer: Noam Chomsky refers to many events that are generally not found in commonplace media that most Americans are hooked to. Hardly any history text book refers (or will ever refer) to such happenings. This book is interesting if you want to know a bit about many of the recent state sponsored criminal acts around the world. You are not likely to know such stuff through TV.However, Chomsky, being a linguist, finds it very hard to stay with easly readable language. This book is a compilation of his interviews. Even then, the sentences are so long and so confusing at times that it becomes difficult to figure out what he wants to say. His language is not easy for everyone.
Excellent, and inappropriately reviewed: I really wonder if the Library Journal reviewer bothered to read the whole book, or just stopped when he found that Chomsky was departing from the post-9/11 unquestioning acceptance of the 'US vs. the evildoers' party line."Chomsky condemns the attacks specifically and then suggests that the deaths are entirely the responsibility of capitalist globalization" - That is a complete misrepresentation; Chomsky repeats several times that Bin Laden and his ilk don't care about globalization. What has created anti-American sentiment around the world, in Chomsky's view, is a US foreign policy dictated by the interests of energy companies, and which supports brutal, anti-human rights dictatorships in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries because it guarantees access to cheap oil. This book was written before the recent US takeover of Iraq, but Chomsky's arguments are quite prescient...
Classic Chomsky: For me, Chomsky always satisfies. This is a great little book worth the few hours it takes to read. I hope that Chomsky will eventually come out with a major work on the causes of the 9/11 tragedy.Even if you dont agree with his conclutions, he is (unfortunately) one of the few critics of the american administration.
Is your head in the sand?: At this point, anyone who still wonders about the reasons behind the WTC attacks either is hopelessly naive or wishing to live with their head in the sand. There is no justification or excuse for the horrible events of 9.11, and Chomsky offers none. However he does present some reasons behind the rage our nation causes around the world. It has nothing to do with "globalazation" or our standard of living- it has to do with supporting terrorist nations such as Israel, starving children in Iraq, and lying to Middle East nations in order to get our troops into Saudi Arabia...
Decepcionante...: La verdad me gustara escribir buenos comentarios sobre este libro... Pero en realidad no es lo que esperaba. Cuando vi el ttulo del libro, esperaba encontrar un relato detallado de los hechos que se desarrollaron durante los ataques del 11 de Septiembre, el secuestro de los aviones, la lucha heroica de los pasajeros del vuelo 93, etc..., pero en su lugar me encontr con una serie de afirmaciones y opiniones (por supuesto muy respetables) del autor sobre poltica internacional de los Estados Unidos para esa poca. Es posible que al libro le hayan puesto el ttulo equivocado; de hecho debera haberse llamado "Disertaciones sobre poltica internacional de los Estados Unidos en 2001", porque realmente es muy poco (o nada) lo que se lee sobre los hechos que ocurrieron el 11 de septiembre, que es lo que uno esperara leer en un libro con este ttulo.
Un Comentario: Mala traduccin al espaol y adems el formato electrnico en el Kindle es deficiente lo que no lo hace fcil de leer. Chomsky, buen pensador y crtico de lo que sucede considera que los hechos del 11 de septiembre tuvieron su origen en todas las actitudes terroristas y desnaturalizadas de la poltica norteamericana en muchos de los conflictos en los que particip en el siglo XX, especialmente los de Afganistan y Rusia.Un pensamiento que hace meditar al lector, es aquel en el que menciona que en USA es terrorismo todo lo que hacen los dems contra ellos, pero no aceptan calificar como acciones terroristas o como violencia si sucede lo contrario (patrocinados por su gobierno como en el caso de Nicaragua y los "contras" o el bombardeo a una fabrica farmaceutica en Sudan y numerosos ejemplos ms).Preferible leer un libro suyo que una recopilacin de entrevistas repetitivas como es este caso.
So many mistakes - so little time!: Many reviewers miss the lack of substance herein while breathlessly sharing its contents. For instance, there's the myth of CIA support of Bin Laden and the Taliban."Bin Laden was vigorously involved in that campaign as a field commander and was aided directly by the CIA," for instance. Both the CIA and Bin Laden's own family have denied any connection, as reported by The Independent, London (October 2001?).Another cannard is that Afghanistan's Hamid Karzi consulted for oil companies prior to the Bush Administration's elevation to leadership - once "again" proving that "it's all about oil!" This was reported in a respected French newspaper in November-December 2001, and the myth took off. It was never sourced however, never subsequently nailed by the Paris newspaper, and Karzi has adamatly denied it stating that no one from that newspaper has ever asked him about it!This is just a couple of too many myths to explode in Chomsky's oh-so -over 15 minutes of fame.
Response to "Charles Darwin" review: Charles is mistaken about people in the gov't not having life-long tenures.Ever hear of J. Edgar Hoover?(And there are others. Do a little reasearch C.D.)
If you hate Amerika, you'll love this book.: Yes, Noam Chomsky has completely marginalized himself with his previous works. Only the most radical, anti-amerika leftist would dare utter Chomsky's name in debate. However, I feel that with this book, a clearer picture is painted of Amerikan foreign policy. Yes, there is a vast and growing anti-western movement in the Muslim word. There are millions of Muslims now who would praise Allah for the chance of blowing up amerikan womenand children. Why? Because Islam is mostly a death-cult in the middle east? Read Noam Chomsky's latest work for a better answer.
Being really smart does not mean you know anything.: Noam Chomsky could well be the character upon whom famed intellectual/cannibalistic mass murderer Hannibal Lecter is based. Brilliant in his chosen field (that's linguistics, not political science), he nonetheless is possessed of an insatiable need to feed on the flesh of the nation that welcomed his people while the Europeans were burning Jews' homes, and preparing to do much worse.9-11 is a miserable, malicious, and awesomely unsophisticated villification of the greatest and most successful country in the history of mankind, the United States of America.If you want to know why your toddler knows the f-word even though you never said it in front of him, read Chomsky. If you want a cogent and insightful analysis of American foreign policy and the politics of Muslim fanaticism, you'd do just as well to ask that same toddler as to read this glob of moronic silt.
He's done it again!: No one speaks as intelligently and as clearly about such important issues as Chomsky. Well worth what ever the price may be.
For the critics...: Regardless of whether or not you think Chomsky hates America, what he brings to the table is indispensable. He simply points out flaws in America's failed foreign policy, and the consequences of it. Chomsky also brings to light the tyrannical acts of the Taliban, al-qaeda and several others. What he does, essentially, is pull no punches with either side. His arguments are logical, and backed up heavily with sources and overwhelming historical evidence.
Tasteless: Unbelievable that this was publsihed less than a month after the tragedy. Clearly very little thought or work was put into it. The author should be ashamed of himself for trying to capitalize on the tragedy to try to put forth his narrow point of view.The format is also cheap as "interview's" , like anyone would ever want to hear this old throwback mindlessly ramle on a subject he knows nothing about.
Chomsky is total disinfo: Look up the "5 Dancing Israelis" and Building 7. It's called controlled opposition, disregard and find out the real truth about 9/11.
Awful: Chomsky is an intellectual leader of the anti-war left. In Chomsky's view, the World Trade Center deaths were regrettable but the unprecedented humiliation of the imperialist power - America - was an historic victory for social justice and human progress. He attributes the bad deeds of America's enemies to America itself - hence the search for "root causes" every time America is attacked. Irrational, Marxist nonsense.
Earth to Noam!: Why is America hated in the Islamic world? What's the better explanation: US foreign policy or simply envy and bitterness? Chomsky should read a little Victor Davis Hanson and get a grip on reality.
For sail boaters, not paddlers: This is a great book for an island-by-island survey of what you can see and do in the San Juans. The authors point out in the intro that it is geared towards sail boaters. I was interested in paddling info and, despite the paddler on the front cover, I didn't find much specific info for this audience. It seems like a great guide for sail boating though, with specific tips like how to avoid various submerged rocks in quiet coves and inlets, and where to find dinghys and anchors.
Hopkins On/Off Gas Spout: I wanted to say good things about this product. I NEEDED this spout to replace one for one of my 5-Gallon gas cans. Someone actually stole the spout from one of my gas cans, if you can beleive that. This spout is smaller so pours more slowly, plus, just the other day, it snapped off and broke from the slightest of pressure. I would NOT recommend this product. Honestly, it was a wasted purchase for me, to say the least!!!Ken j.Nehalem, ORNW Oregon Coast
Defective Product: Leaked everywhere badly, required a lot of phone calls, wouldn't give refund, referred to someplace else, initially bought 2 units, was sent extra washers after complaint, still leaked, they requested I upload photos to prove, I didn't have digital camera at time, was finally sent 2 more units, got 1 to work, the other gave me trouble, practiced with water so as to not waste gas, may have gotten second to work but I don't have very much confidence in it, may still go back to old cap, sick of making calls, purchased nearly a year ago.
Best EVER!: Man, I have tried EVERY round brush style and brand to use on my fine hair with a blow dryer, and this one is the best--I just ordered my 3rd one (to have extras at gym). Really curls hair the best!
Nice Chamber Music: I recently came to know the music of the Russian composer Anton Stepanovivh Arensky (1861-1906). He was Rimsky-Korsakov's student at the St Petersburg Conservatory in 1879. After graduation in 1882, he began teaching music, having Rachmaninov and Scriabin among his students. He became a conductor, and was appointed Director of the Imperial Chapel in 1895.The 1st of his 2 Piano Trios was published in 1894, and the 2nd was composed in 1905, a year before his death. The 1st Trio is one of his best-known chamber compositions, while the 2nd is far less known. However, both show Arensky's skills in writing instrumental compositions. The 1st Trio seems more dynamic, with nicer melodies and themes.The trios are performed by 3 members of the well-known Borodin Quartet, taking at this occasion the name Borodin Trio. They are excellent Russian performers, who emigrated from the Soviet Union and settled in Canada.
Don't buy this!: Unless you enjoy paying money to hear a wonder piece of chamber music played at "a rehearsal tempo", with a violinist who occasionally misses a note, DON'T BUY THIS. I am extremely disappointed in this recording.Shame on me for not listening to the samples. I saw that it was performed by the Borodin Trio, and I have another recording by them which is very good. Why this one is performed so slow is beyond me.Make sure you listen to the samples before you decide to buy. I didn't -- and I am sorry. It's a lousy rendition.
No Confrontation at all: There is no doubt that both of them are well-educated gentlemen. This destory the whole purpose of the book - they are too polite to have any confrontation. Throughout the whole book, they are just presenting each other their own views. They actually haven't met each other to have a discussion and in fact, the title of the book misled me. It should be called "Belief or Non-Belief: Some Correspondences"
WTF: ok first offwhere is rap mixed with metalwhere is limp bizkitwhere is deftoneswhere is kornwhere is linkin parkwhere is staind.........tool.........rage againts the machineand all other nu-metal bandsif you listen to nu metal dont buy these albumdamn it
To counter-balance the 5 star review...: The price for this 3 Cd set is nuts! As I write this review the pricing is at $791.72 & $295.00 New and $661.95 & $169.99 used (total of four (4) items).This is a 1998 Rhino records set. It's really excellent in the music department and have no issues BUT is the same set from the Rhino 1997 catalog series; 'Mellow Rock Hits Of The 70's'.Look for these 3 Rhino disc's. The song tract list is exactly the same or shuffled abit.Mellow Rock Hits Of The 70's: Ventura Highway (used $1.14)Mellow Rock Hits Of The'70s: Summer Breeze (used $1.93)Mellow Rock Hits of 70's: Sundown (used $1.56)These are the exact titles as listed here and the current pricing as of Jul 10, 2012 that totals $4.63. Good information makes you a bit smarter customer in the long run.enjoy...
Yup, not their finest work: I also had problems with this one. The first one I bought from a toy store. When I got home I noticed all the water had dried up (at least not spilled over my expensive train table like the other poster's!) So they exchanged it and I noticed that most of them were all dried up. I thought it was just because I live in the dry desert.My son is very gentle on his toys and one day the magnet popped out. Well, aside from the magnet being a choking hazard, the other end of the magnet is a spear like a thumbtack! Gah! I contacted Learning Curve and they did send me a new one at no charge, but they also informed me that their lifetime warranty was no longer valid. So I guess I'm on a list somewhere that means I'll never get another warranty issue resolved....Seems like they'd be more concerned since kids play with these things...And yes, at nearly 20 bucks a train, you'd think you'd get a bit more for your money.
Disappointment: What a rip off! You can't try the cars out in the blister pack and when you get it home you find out that the water level does NOT rise and fall....there is no water in the tanker so it is a very very expensive nothing.
Exploring Ghastly Inner States In A Painfully Esoteric Style: This book was just way over my head. I was impressed with Acker's ability to vividly expose the true inner monologues of her characters, but I just didn't grasp the point or even what was going on half the time. This book just totally bummed me out, and left me confused.
Inspiring and foundational: I'm a self-directed learner and had been struggling with generating interest in mathematics for some time. I had bought this book in the hopes that it would bridge my love and interest in logic with a new found interest in mathematics. It did exactly that.
humor right up there with Mark Twain: As good as Mark Twain? All I can say is both authors made me laugh out loud so I call that equal. I am not a native Floridian, just grew up here and then retired here and all I know about the area written about is through visits, but people are people and they are both real and funny. Real humor comes from deep inside with situations that the author paints with words that make it seem so real you feel you are there in person.If you like this book I recommend "The Creek" by J.T.Glisson. The story of the Florida Fish and Wildlife boys being fooled by the locals one dark night is beyond funny.My only complaint of "If Nothin Don't Happen" is that I cannot find a reasonable priced copy to buy for my own. I will haunt the used book stores in hopes....
beautiful: I enjoyed the Celtic Book of Living and Dying very much. The art work was great. How I read the book was slow. I read passages the would Leave the book to ponder the words. I found this very satisfying.
inaccuarte overview of celtic mythology: its a waste of money. i own several celtic mythology books. this one is poorly organized and only gives summaries of the myths. not good. would not buy again. there are better books out there.. oh and comparing it to the Egyptian Book of the Dead is just misleading. One thing good about it is the pictures are very pretty. kids will love that part.
DREAM LOVER: JAMES SPADER WAS DREAMY IN THIS MOVIE :) BUT WHEN IS HE NOT? GREAT MOVIE. BE CAREFUL WHO YOU DREAM FOR YOU JUST MIGHT GET HER/HIM AND FIND OUT IT ISN'T WANT YOU IMAGINED IT TO BE. DIRECTOR DID A GREAT JOB CAPTURING FEELINGS.
Mdchen Amick is hot: Mdchen Amick is hot - pretty face -- but it takes more than a beautiful face to make a great movie. This is a light movie - first 20 minutes are fascinating but then it's downhill and good for a fast forward.
Spader should've gotten at least a nomination for this film.: ...because his performance here is spot-on perfect, especially when the suspicion starts to brew. You can truly feel his anguish. Madchen Amick is also in the groove as her psychosis slowly comes to fruition. The secondary characters are thankfully left in the background, as they're not very interesting and the focus is kept on the burgeoning tension between man and wife. When Spader finally snaps you wish you were there with him laying the smack down.That they didn't release the unrated version is a travesty, but fortunately no plot is lost in this version (only some great nudity and hot sex with Madchen). At any rate this dvd is worth it for James Spader's performance of a lifetime, and the superb if unoriginal story.
Two-thumbs DOwN cut version: MGM has made the weak decision to release this wonderful film in the cut-to-shreds R-rated version, instead of the Special Unrated Version, in all its original uncut unrated splendor. MGM blows! Don't waste your money, just wait for the Special Unrated Version. Some company of worth will release it soon, we hope!
Be Careful What You Wish For....: 4 1/2 StarsFor years, I have been waiting for the DVD release of this classy, sexy, chilling twist on Happily Ever After.James Spader is intriguing (OK, and gorgeous!) as the guy who seems to have everthing when he meets the girl of his dreams. Madchen Amick as the best psycho-chick I've seen in years, eventually has him doubting everyone around him, and everyone around him doubting his sanity. Who's more obsessed: him in his pursuit of the perfect life, or her and.... Hey! Watch the movie! I've never seen the unrated version, though I hope to. I am "voting with my wallet" and buying the rated version. It's a great movie and industry bottom-liners need to be reminded that there is a market (i.e. profit for them) in the release of great movies that aren't mega-blockbusters! So I'll watch and enjoy this one, and suggest you do, too. And when the unrated version comes out, I'll buy it, too!
a correction: The cast list is wrong, this movie stars JAMES SPADER and MADCHEN AMICK. not Kristy McNichol. I hope that is unrated version, so please correct the cast list as it is totally wrong. specify if it is the unrated version.
Fake Widescreen by MGM (Video & DVD): Review for: "Dream Lover" (1994)Studio: MGM (Video & DVD)DVD Release Date: June 1, 2004The Widescreen is a Fake Widescreen. They took the Pan and Scan Full Screen Movie Issue (which has the ends of the movie image cut off) and cropped off the top and bottom of the movie to make it conform to the aspect ratio of 1.85:1 for Widescreen TVs.
DVD released on June 1st: I really enjoyed this movie, simply because of James Spader's performance. And for all of you fans who wanted this on DVD, it is going to be released in June of this year. Enjoy!
Not the Unrated version. Release it again!: Wonderous performances from Spader & Amick.DVD should have been available as the Unrated version! I know the VHS had both versions. Which is why I am keeping my unrated VHS copy until whoever releases this again presents this great film the way it needs to be seen, unrated. Why does this ALWAYS happen to films like this? They did this same treatment to Boxing Helena(another one of my favorites) as well, trying to shove the rated/dumbed down versions to us when we KNOW the unrated versions were released previously. Is it really THAT hard to put another 4minutes onto this DVD? DVD's like this should be going forward with progress, not regressing. And the original cover was better too. Ok, now I am done.
How do we ever really know what someone else is thinking?: You just can't, and it's scary. Soon after his hasty divorce Ray meets and marries the beautiful, seemingly perfect Lena. The longer they are married, the more lies he uncovers. This is a great, sexy thiller, and I would reccomend it to people who like those kinds of movies.
draw a trend line: draw two more trend lines. One equidistant above and one equidistant below the first trend line, either buy or sell when the price crosses the one of the two outside trend lines............the trident strategy.
So Far, No Success: Nothing on the server seems to respond to pings or anything else that the manual suggest might be available. Even reading the manual, it was somewhat difficult to even turn the device on, but once I removed the plastic tab and had it powered, it still refuses to respond. So far, INOi hasn't even acknowledged any of my emails.Clearly, I don't recommend.
Great problem solver: I have used USB HD's but they seem to fail with heavy traffic. This network HD was to let any of my networked PC's access my files (MP3,JPG) without worry if the holding PC was on/awake. This network HD will be on battery back up and never turned off, always ready to serve. (A simple way to serve without a dedicated server PC) I KNOW NETWORKING and ping worked fine. I followed the instructions to setup but used an easier way to attach from XP (Home and Pro), Start, Run, //Storage [ok], the Right Mouse Click on PUBLIC - Map Network Drive.Not sure of throughput rate, but Network Utilization was mostly 47% of 100Mbps.Only limitation I see is the FAT32 format. The largest size of one file is 4 Gig, so a 4.7G DVD image is not possible.
I never got the book or a refund: Dont try to buy this as you will never get it or get a refund after you waste time trying to get this seller to respond and send the book. Too bad, I would have much rather had the book than a dispute with Amazon. Cheap.
Great narrative of the pioneer trek and survival in snow.: The book is a real-time narrative of the Donner Party's journey, winding up with their entrapment and cannibalism in the winter of 1846-47. It's easy to read and the pictures, maps and journal entries add excitement and realism. Could not put it down and am reading it again.
An Uninspired, Text-Book Read: I have to strongly disagree with the previous Amazon reviews praising this book. If you are looking for an in-depth telling of the Donner Party story rich with anecdotes and emotion, this is not the book for you. I made the mistake of assuming that the chronological format of this book would give the author an interesting opportunity to share details from specific days of the party's journey. Instead, every chapter is a wash, not nearly using the referenced primary sources to their fullest, most revealing and telling potential. The book is formatted much like a middle-school text book and reads like one, too. The writing is poor, bare-bones, repetitive and elementary. However, if you're looking for a coffee-table book that guests can simply open and say, "Oh, you have a book on the Donner Party", get this book; that is all it is good for.
Elizabeth Dilling's wiki: Here are the first two paragraphs of her wiki.Elizabeth Dilling Stokes (April 19, 1894 - May 26, 1966) was an American anti-communist, antisemitic, Nazi-sympathizing anti-war activist, and writer in the 1930s and 1940s, who stood trial for Sedition in what is now called the Great Sedition Trial of 1944.[1][2][3]The author of four political books, Dilling claimed that Marxism and "Jewry" were synonymous.[4] She believed that Francisco Franco was a brave Christian.[5] She claimed many prominent figures were Communist sympathizers, including Eleanor Roosevelt, Mahatma Gandhi, Franz Boas and Sigmund Freud.[6]...So consider yourself warned.
Why so pricey: This book is for version 3. Borland has released version 8. Why isnt this book cheaper?A book on AutoCAD 12 would sell for $3.00.
Not Recommended: If you have programmed in any other language, don't buy this book.The text is very sparse and hardly adds any weight to the langauge of object pascal. You are better off geting some other title.If you have never programmed in your life, and you want to program in Delphi than the book will suffice to get you off the ground.
description incorrect: I ordered these twice and each time I got the wrong size sent to me. The pink ones only come in the Large and not the smaller size for my very petite 6 year old. Amazon or the manufacturer is really bad about clearly stating that the pink set is the larger size and the purple set is the smaller size. I ordered it from 3 different places and all 3 times, I thought I was ordering the smaller set and I would receive the pink larger size.
Wrong color: Like mentioned in another review, I expected pink clubs but got the purple. I ordered the Large set for my five year old (she's very tall for her age). Somewhere they need to do a better job of being clear on what color you will receive, or give you a choice. I did not even see purple listed. With that said, the clubs and bag seem like quality peices, well constructed and weighted. The stand bag looks like it will hold up for a few years. I think this set is well worth the price of $69.00. Would give 5 stars but I will wait to see how they hold up to actually use, and the fact that I did not get the pink ones.
never got it: I would love to leave a review. But they have yet to send me this product.. I have gotten the wrong product both times.
Perfect birthay gift for a 7 yr old girl who wants to golf with dad: I must admit, it took longer than I thought to come in, but it was well worth the wait. They missed her June birthday party but I was able to print a picure and give her the golf balls. The clubs arrived today and they are great. Can't wait t to give them to her weekend.
BORING!: This is a dull narrative delivered in a bored monotone by someone who doesn't seem to care very much. Background "music" seems to be some sort of music machine dross. You're better off with Bukowski spoken-word CDs.
Among the great books of all time: Huang Po's zesty and expansive teachings are brought to life in this small but infinitely faceted gem. It is as if the quintessential Zen Master himself is present in these pages and in the mind and being of the reader. It is remarkable that a transmission in a translated text over a thousand years old can be so profound. I have been reading and living with this book, and Huang Po's presence, for decades and the humor, as penetrating as the Marx Brothers, the generosity of spirit, and the merciless and elegantly paired down exposition of Zen are a continual source of joy.
Zen teaching of Huang-Po: The introduction to this book is a good overview and introduction to Zen for beginners.The notes provided by the translator are very erudite and helpful.This is an awsome text from a very enlightened Master. He continually refutes ceremony and intellectualism, pointing instead to the ineffable nature of Zen. Avoiding dualism and concentrating on immediacy, the Master says, reveals the path to follow the Way. This approach to "Reality" will be very foreign to the uninitiated Western mind. The book deserves to be read several times to allow its meaning to unfold.
Simple and effect book: I just read half of the book and did not feel like reading rest. It's is because, content of book on first half have conveyed information very effectively about transcending the mind, rest is only same message in different aspect.This book also inspired me start blog iamnotminddotwordpressdotcom.If you need one simple answer for all the questions, here you go.
A penetrating insight into Zen Buddhism by an early master: The teachings of Huang Po bear re-reading many, many times. So compressed and dense is this work that it is impossible to absorb the full import of Huang Po's insights at first pass. I've read it at least a dozen times and continue to discover new insights. This is one of three books I'd want on a desert island.Don't be put off by its compression.This book was translated by John Blofield in the 1950s and appears to remain the only English translation. I'd love to know what happened to Blofield, who apparently was living in Thailand at the time he translated the work.
A small but powerful book.: Of the hundreds of books on Zen out there, this one does a classy job in communicating the wordless/mindless Zen. Although it is not an introductory book, one may wish to read it anyway later, after one has had an introduction to Zen. A once in lifetime/s book :-) and don't be deceived by the small size !
Judy Garland in Hollywood: I'm a big Judy Garland fan, but found this CD lacking. Her voice didn't have that extra force she always puts into her songs. Some of them sounded like a bad imitation or she recorded it in her sleep. It says o"original soundtrack. Maybe it needs to be re-mastered. It certainly won't be my favorite.

GET HAPPY, GET THIS CD: This cd could become my favourite in my collection. Spanning the whole of Judy Garland's career with a fantastic selection from her film career. The highlight of this collection is the soundtrack recording of "The Man That Got Away". Even if your not a fan you'll enjoy this cd.
Concise means rudimentary at best: I purchased this dictionary, based on Oxford's reputation, to replace a Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary lost in a move. I Needed something portable that didn't require a magnifying glass. I was very disappointed. It is much too concise. Many hi-tech related, modern, and common use words are missing. Don't bother to use it for Scrabble. Perhaps I am spoiled or read obscure literature, but I don't think so. I recommend that you give this one a miss unless you need a 8" X 9 1/2" paperweight.
defective, dissappointing quality for a book sold "new": I purchased this dictionary for my classroom. When it arrived the cover was pretty worn looking for a new dictionary, but I figured I got it for a good price, so "no never mind", but yesterday one of my students was using it and found the pages were not attached and many were in the wrong order. It is not worth the cost of postage to return it, but I sure felt like I wasted $15 that could have been used to by overhead transparencies, novels, or other class supplies.
........Go back to the drawing board.........!: ........Who every put this together left ALL of Frankie's GOOD TUNES on the cutting room floor!
Frankie Lymon was an awesome singer and perrformer.: With only being 26 years old, i am infatuated with old music. I always liked the song Why Do Fools Fall In Love by Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers but when I saw the movie I just got real excited about him, his life, and his music. I wish I could have rown up inhis era to really know him as a entertainer. Long live Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers.
The wheel frame material chosen is too weak for this kind of toy: We bought this toy truck before thanksgiving for our son few years ago, he played for less than half hour and was complaining that one of the wheel was broken. We found out the wheel frame is made of very thin plastic, We think the plastic material is not right one for this kind of toy. It must be chosen for profit purposes only.
Not good: Can't get the rods to stay together...falling apart out of the package. These rods are cheaply made and will not last.
The wonders of Life folios: These books are magnificient! Not only are they educational but they come with microscope slides within each folio to go along with the Life Science material. Dr. Joseph Greene who wrote these books was a scientific genius! I wish he were still alvie so I could work with him!!!
NAUTICA STYLE: EXCELLENT WATCH, WHEREVER I GO EVERYBODY ASK ME WHERE I BOUGHT IT. NEVER HAD HAD A NAUTICA WATCH BEFORE, THIS IS MY FIRST, AND IT DIDN'T DISSAPOINTED ME. IT'S GOOD SIZED, KEEPS CORRECT TIME AND NICE LOOKING. THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE THAT MUCH IS THE BAND, BUT THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN FIX WITH AN SPARE ONE. I RECOMMENDE IT TO EVERYONE, YOU WILL FEEL IT'S WORTH MORE THAN IT COSTS.
Glitzy illustrations NOT enough: Yes, the pictures are nice.But as a useful resource on a trip, this book was amazingly deficient.Major destinations are inadequately covered, while more minor ones are discussed in detail. The Lonely Planet guide was infinitely more useful and informative.
Knopt Guide: Egypt: I have used the Knopt guide books before. I find it the guide great for travel and fun for make belive travel.
there IS fusion beyond Miles Davis: For a mere 6 or 7 bucks, you can buy this album, a compilation of tracks that originally appeared on the Muse label in the 1970's, edited and sequenced by Mocean Worker to expand on the funk and textures inherent in the original recordings. And what results is a picture of fusion that is simultaneously melodic and funky, spacy but arranged, and almost never easy. Yet it doesn't really sound much at all like the music of Miles Davis during the same period, and that's a compliment, only because most non-Davis fusion I had heard before this was either incoherent or begging for the pop charts. Plus it's refreshing that most of these tracks have no guitar, putting them closer to a gospel/African/soul base but with avant-garde touches, all with thick, warm sound.
I Don't Get It: I read the synopsis for this book in a "Best of.." book list for 2001. It's described as a psychological thriller about a psychiatrist who saves a man from drowning. The catch is the man he saves was once a client of his who he inadvertently helped send away to a correctional institute because of damaging testimony.Sounds good right? I missed it. I didn't find the book tense at all. Every time it started to work towards something I thought was going to be remotely suspenseful, it petered out. I was really disappointed. In fact about the highest praise I can give it is that at just over two hundred pages it reads like a halfway decent short story. A not terribly exciting short story, but a short story never the less.
Silly book + Kindle Formatting Problems: Admittedly, I chose this book in a rush - I had read about Barker's WWI novels and chose the one set in present day. It sounded intriguing in the description, but I found the premise to be ridiculous and the writing shallow. Additionally, my Kindle copy had all sorts of formatting problems - I don't know how much of the book was missing (I read it in about 5 evenings). There were a lot of sentences cut off in the middle, and paragraphs cut off without punctuation (I don't think the writer was trying to be avant-garde). I never experienced this before with any Kindle book. Overall, not worth the money - too short, too uninteresting, too unbelieveable - plus the formatting problems.
Awesome!: This book reads like an awesome psychological journey! It brings you through so many emotions, and even after you finish reading it...The charcters stick with you.
Two person play as a novel: I will admit that I listened to this Audio Book on drive to and from Las Angeles to Los Vegas. I thought it a good chance to be introduced to Pat Barker who seems to get such rave reviews. This is basically a two person character study in the guise of a psychological thriller that is not all that thrilling. I found the store interesting enough and the writing crisp, but thesecondary plot of Tom Seymour and his wife seems lost as she walks out of his life just when he is consumed with this former child patient who returns to extract his revenge. Or does he? I will give this a marginal thumbs up because the two main characters are well written and vivid, with Danny Miller the tormented child murderer an excellent character. But in the end I did not find this very satisfying to listen to and doubt I would have finished it if I had picked it up as a book.
Not Real Impressed !: The book is very wordy, but vague. It should not take 1200 or so pages to explain it's contents. The book does not readily get to the point. The chapters on SQL were very poorly written. The syntax for commands were not adequately explained and were horribly intertwined in the examples, such that it was difficult to derive the real syntax for individual clauses and commands. Chapters on modeling the database via ER and EER were also vague and written very poorly. Examples throughout the book used coincidental values and scenarios that mask out the true nature of the concepts being proposed. The author should have taken the time to put in "meaningful" examples. The exercises at the end of each chapter do not define the scope of questions being asked. They are too open ended. If it were not a requirement that I use this book, I would not waste my money on it! I could have written a better book!
The worst approach to database design I've ever seen: It's a good thing these folks are book writers and academics and do not design databases for a living. The writers pretend that such realities as deadlines and budget do not exist. The text is filled with Entity Relationship diagrams that must add 200% to the cost of their designs. The book is very difficult to read and if you're already designing databases, this methodology will drive you up the wall. Teachers, Please do not inflict this book on any more students.
Poorly written, poorly organized, and incomplete.: I was quite disappointed with _Database Systems_. I had expected a clear, concisely written encyclopedia of all things relational. What I got was a poorly (and ambiguously) written tome that is rife with Britishisms (who the hell calls rows 'tuples' and tables 'relations' anymore???), that is missing a fair amount of critical information, and that commits the cardinal sin of a reference book -- it is BADLY INDEXED.For 61 bills you could do a lot better elsewhere.
its awful: this book is very dry and boring, i believe that anyone can learn anything if its explained correctly. having been recommended this book by my university i bought it ( i was recommended deitel for java and that proved excellent so i stuck with their recommendation) but when i try to read this book i feel myself; not understanding but falling asleep.its more like a reference book and the chapters dont seem to be in any order. i'm annoyed that i have wasted my money on this book.
I hate this book: This is the required textbook for a graduate course I am taking in Information Studies. Having been assured by the professor that one needed no math, science, or computer background to do well, I put aside my reservations. But here we are, one month into the semester, with this book as our only teaching tool, and I am failing the course. (I thus far have a 3.93 average in grad school)The bottom line - this book is NOT a good instructional tool, especially not for beginners.
Wrong Book: the seller sent me a book that is not suppose to be sold in United States, and the ISBN does not match with the one he previosly stated. So, basicly wrong book...
zzzzzzzzzz: this book gives me a major headache. unfortunately, it's assigned material for an intro database class i'm taking. as a business, not computer science major, I find this book to be overly complicated with too much verbiage. this is an intro book, it should be simple, yet it reads like a math book. just explain the simple concepts and not go into elaborate detail with terminology and database mathematical concepts. this book is geared toward hard-core techies. if at all possible, save your money for an easier and more entertaining book, not a dry, boring, incomprehensible one. alright, now that i've let out my frustrations, i'll get back to studying this book now for the upcoming final. wish me luck. i'll need it!
Not for the classroom: For two quarters now, I have had a one-chapter reading assignment out of this book for a total of 20 chapters. This book is nearly impossible to read. The only reason you would want a text this expansive is if you planned to write your own database system to compete with MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc..
Information Lost Among Words: I honestly do not see how this book could be useful to anyone. If you are a beginner, you will soon get lost among the endless, and pointless words, searching for the rare important information. I read paragraph after paragraph that had no real point, or would begin to describe a subject, and then just drop it, stating "but this is beyond the scope of this book." Then why spend two pages talking about it and refer to the concept later?? If you're someone looking for a good reference, look elsewhere as well. Most subjects do not get explained to the fullest, except for the database design model. I'd talk about this more, but it's beyond the scope of this review.
Wide perspective book, without annoying theory.: Wide perspective book, without annoying theory. I would suggest this book to people who are not dealing everyday in db-areas. It's a full starting compendium on db theory, technology, design methodology. The arguments are not deeply explained in detail, but the aim of the book is to give the big picture view. The didactical approach is well organized during the exposition and fulfilled with many examples. The language style adopted is easy, the graphical design gives a soft perception of heavy-weighted arguments. The explanation follows a practical way with few formalism applied even if the scientific rigour is always mantained. I would recommend this book to people who are novice to db world or as a reference in the bookshelf for all IT professionals.
Careful now...: The product is a stack of 3-hole punch papers, unbound, which seems to require the accompanying CD-rom. I wish I had known that before I bought it.
excellent: This book is an easy read and is a must read for anybody who works in the Hip-Hop industry. I highly reccommend it.
The New Generation: The wave of current changes within hip hop, have since reflected upon a great movement, that continues to transpire believe in the greatness of a young generation of mainly disposessed radicals. Who have continued to be masters of their individual destiny's.This book holds the key towards understanding the relationship between the strong-willed and steadfast.Written by Julian ChuckyAuthor: Hip Hop's Wall $treet
Good quality and match for the UCO Micro lantern: Good flame... better than cheap tea lights from a home decoration or discount store. Worked very well in my UCO Micro lantern. Each lasted 3-4 hours.
Marvellous Chant and Polyphony from 12th Century France: I have gotten so enchanted when I heard this magic CD. The voices are so special. They bring us the atmosphere of the religiosity of medieval France. All is vibrant in this CD. When I am listening the music, I can feel myself in an old medieval abbey. I can imagine the mass, the medieval world. This Cd is the most sensitive work that I have heard lately.
Boy what a GREAT Beautiful Series!: First of all this is for the entire series. Boys Be is just a great series. It's about life. From a Boy's POV. With some amazing storytelling. You really come to like to the characthers. And feel for them when life is hard and smile for them when they're happy. I laughed and smiled at each story. With an awesome dub cast. This is just a Beautiful anime!
Red's Ruin: This book is an easy read, but a difficult review. If you want to read about Cornbread Red's association with unknown gamblers playing for huge (unnamed, split-seven-ways) stakes, this is the book for you. If you want anecdotes about other greats he encountered, forget it. Danny Jones and Fats get brief mentions. The rest is mostly about Rubie, Bones, Al, and a host of other household names. Not really a bad book, but it could have been much better.
good historic read: Take a journey into a different time with this mini-biography of sorts about the famous pool hustler. A very entertaining read, this book gives the reader perspective on how things were 15-65 years ago while telling this great hustler's life story. It covers how he got started in the game as a boy and continues up through and beyond married life. Both the highs and lows of this pool hustler's life are told in an intersting way.This book is a good pool story that's well written by a pool player for pool players. Reading stories like this makes me want to be a better pool player. It certainly provides a some motivation to go practice.
Basic Flat Picking: This is a GREAT DVD for all levels of player. For a beginner, this will really jump start your learning. Digest this DVD and book and it'll keep you busy for 6 months of intensive learning...AND you'll be learning the right way. The intermediate player might consider this DVD as a technique checkup. Lots of neat runs and picking technique. Steve Kaufman is one of the best!
A fantastic book for people who are not regular book readers: Its a beautiful book for people who are interested in non- fiction kind of books. The stories are very fascinating and grab your concentration. I am not a book worm, nor am I a person who likes reading books. But the first story itself creates a kind of inquisitiveness in the reader. Well you could not ask for a better book to atleast look like a book worm.
book I remember: I first read this book when I was a young woman. I have always loved history and historical fiction. I felt that this book gave a very close portrayal of the kind of relationship which could develop between "cousins" and very closely related persons, especially noble ones. It made me quite understanding of the bond between CharlesII and his sister---even as he used her for his own ends. I want to read it again and own a copy----even a paperback.
Excellent book: It is a an excellent book. I bought this book to help my daughter. It is very easy to follow. Summary and review sections are very helpful.
Love this movie..: I fell in love with this movie within the first couple minutes. I can watch it over and over again and laugh and cry every single time. I'm no expert or anything but I think that the casting was done perfectly. The actors that were chosen to play the different characters in the movie were excellent, I couldn't imagine any other actors playing those parts. This movie, as simple as it is really stands out and is deffinatley one of my all time favorites.
100 times better than your typical gay-oriented dance album: Containing none of the dreck that most gay pride cd's do contain, puts this one right at the top of the "genre" - maybe that's how they named it. Anyways instead of songs like "It's Raining Men" by The Weather Girls and "So Many Men, So Little Time" by Miguel Brown, you get current club tunes - "Din Da Da" by Kevin Aviance, "Moment Of My Life" by Bobby D'Amobrosio (with the more than talented Michelle Weeks on vocals) and "Love Commandments" by Gisele Jackson to name a few of the top tunes. One downfall to this disc though. It's megamixed.
Beautiful photos but no useful information: This book has lovely pictures of ways to use and display paper of all types, like tissue paper flowers and ornaments, but there are few clear instructions. There is also a resource guide but no information as to what materials used in the book came from the listed sources. Apparently, if you want specific information on the details of the layouts you have to buy another book intitled "Details". This book was very dissapointing.
Perfect size!: I keep my mini Sharpie on my hospital ID badge - it's very handy for many uses at the bedside. My only complaint is that I'd like to have the option to purchase a 4-pack of all black markers!
I too was deceived....: I also was expecting a 12 pack of pastel colors. I paid $10.00 for a stupid 4 pack of sharpies. I think this is false advertising and if this company can't advertise without being deceitful, amazon should not allow them to be on their marketplace. We will see how Office Quarters handles this return.
Detailed explanations.: I did not know much about the topic and found the info very clear and well explained. I would recommend this dvd as an educational tool to specifically those with no or little understanding about codependency.
Outdated information: Since the powers that be have now decided to divide the earth's salt water into 5 oceans, the 5th being below 60 degrees latitude, the title and information in the book are outdated and should be revised.
Decent look at racism: This is black professor of English George Armstrong's latest book, an examination of racism. The book is narrated by John, a black man in Kentucky during 1914. John appears to be a normal black man, but he has a terrible secret: he is a hermaphrodite! He manages to conceal this terrible secret from his wife of 15 years, Estelle, but only by making a bargain with the Devil.Although many believe it to be a masterpiece, I thought this book was retarded.
real disappointment: This was a real overwrought tale of "injustice". What surprised me the most was how truely racist it was, not against blacks, but against whites. The plot may have occurred years ago, but the writer's sentiments were clearly written with a racist attitude from right now. Want to read a real story of injustice, read "Snow In August" by Pete Hamill. He doesn't color the time about which he is writing with his own current attitudes and opinions.
Could've been written by a fifth-grader: This book was painfully boring. I honestly believe a young student could have written it. The subject had potential but was squashed immediately. One of only a few boooks I wish I never read.
great 1st chptr, terrible 160 pages or so, good last few pgs: this book is WEAK. a cool story but written with a formula we already know; the reader always feels ahead of the game... and it becomes unbearable. It's an easy read, accessible to younger and infrequent readers and even might facilitate some good discussion, but it's nothin' to write home about. Examples of strong, proud and heroic, african americans are plentiful in our history, with voices worth listening to, so skip this glossy, over-simplified, book for something true and well-written.
A Lesson Before Dying: This was a very long winded book. It was not a page turner at all. I found myself not wanting to finish the book for as short as it was. I thought it would get better, but it never did. At times the writer leaves you hanging as to what is happening with the prisoner and then out of no where, the writer takes you back to the prisoner. Somewhat confusing and very boring. The only excitement is when the teachers go off into a field and have sex. I do not understand why that was even brought into the book. Boring. This is the second worst book I have bought going by the Oprah Winfrey Book Club Review. Bad Taste.
Slow, dull, unintersting, and characterless: This book never grabs your interest. The plot is a great (yet tired) idea, with limitless potential, but the author falls so short of either making the plot go anywhere, or developing any characters, that you turn page after page waiting and hoping that something will grab your interest or pull an emotional string, and all you are left with is disappointment.
Required reading: This book was required reading for my hobbies English class, honestly, I did not want to read it. The title promised an unhappy ending, and the other books that had been chosen for us to read this year were not my favorites to say the least; however, after reading the book I find myself having really enjoyed it. A Lesson Before Dying was full of emotion and a story that contains a message readers will not soon forget. This book contains writing that descriptive and colourful as well as historically accurate. The reader will feel as if the trial was real instead of just a fictitious one. Although the story was a work of fiction other trials chose to place blame on those of African-American decent , the author was truly able to capture the different feelings, prejudices, and thoughts of his characters.
Absolutly a must read!: I picked up this book that my wife had bought and I couldn't put it down. I finished it in less than a day. I was totally involved with the main characters. Come on Grant do the right thing. Yes Miss Emma, move the people by the strength of your will and character. And of course Jefferson, please, please understand. After I read Jefferson's words near the end then the final chapters I was left breatheless, moved to appreciative tears and happy..no privledge that I read this book. Was this 'the best' book I've ever read? No. But is this a book I will insist everyone read? Yes, by all means. In fact, I'm going to hurry home and give this book back to my wife....she is in for a treat!
Destined to become an American classic: Without a doubt, this is one of the finest pieces of literature I have ever read. It should be used in literature classes to exemplify the art of character development.
an honest portrayel of life and prejudice: i noticed that the teenagers found this book too slow, too boring, too unrealistic......too bad most of them that read it did not have the maturity to actually expand beyond the pages of this book. (my 15 year old would probably not like it either) i found it very honest...very real....and one that makes me more aware of the prejudices that we have all grown up with and are exposed to on a daily basis. well written....
It took way to long to get into: the book in its entirity was a great book but for people like me i like to get into in with in the first 5 chapters of so, but it took way way to long to get in to it, but it was very good once you get to the 25-26 chapters I think it took to long
this book will reach you...: as the characters struggle to find their own identities. it's not a simple book, and there are times when the characters will get on your nerves with their hypocritic natures, but overall, the book was moving. i was assigned this book for school, but i'm not ashamed to say that i would have kept reading it anyway, even if it had not been for a project. except for the occasional dull spot, the book will keep you reading, and you'll be almost surprised when you reach the end. don't be shocked if you sit and look at the book when you're done, it can be emotionally draining.
STILL a lesson today!: I bought this book for school and I'm glad I did. It was a good read~~I don't know how I missed it. Good condition as promised.
I was both haunted and inspired.: This is one of those books you will never forget. Filled with kindness, desperation, yearning, charity, fear, faith, and love, it will leave you haunted and inspired. It is a story of two opposites who come to be one. One in heart and soul. Brothers. Friends. This is what life is all about. Or should be.
My Review: The Book A Lesson Before Dying is one of the best books. I give the book a high rating. Personally, I read the book twice and it still gets to me how much I like it. The author Ernest J. Gaines was so good it made you feel what everyone else felt. I rate this book five out five. His writing was making us feel what people felt on death row.My favorite chapter was 19 the Christmas program because of everything that was going on and Bok pointing at everything and also the kids when they were messing up the line. My least favorite Chapter was was the last chapter when Jefferson dies because you know that he didn`t do nothing and killed an innocent man because they were racists. So if people that say this book isn`t a good book, they lied it is the best book.
Just BookIt2001 book club review of A Lesson: A Lesson Before Dying is a must for anyone's home Library. It is definately what one would call a "modern classic". I read this book with an online book club whose name is reflected in the title of this review JustBookIt2001. We had a very poignant discussion on this book. So many themes and issues are evident in this novel. You could debate forever on the subject of capital punishment alone. Mr. Gaines does an excellent job of setting the era and letting us visualize the location that these events take place in. This novel takes you back to a time that unfortunately was not that far into our nation's past, where there is racial inequality and judicial injustice. The question is who really learn's the lesson in this story? And how far have we really come in this day and age?
This was chosen as Chaffey College book of the year in 1999!: Ernest J. Gaines definitely captures the heat of the south in his story of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. He has brought us all back to a place where society lived in fear and scapegoats were needed to hide their own. Too bad that's the way it was and could be again if we forget where we came from. Thanks to Ernest J. Gaines we are reminded once again!

a MUST read: This book gives me something new to think about every time I open it. Moving and enriching, this book will always remain in my top 5 favorite books... which is saying a lot since my bookshelf contains 100s of books. Whether you are black or white, pink or green, EVERYONE should read this book.
Boring: I had to read this book for Pre-IB English. I hated it! It might be the fact that I had to read it, but I doubt it. I did like that characters, but I felt the book was not good for a 14 year old to be reading. I believe this book would be better required reading for older students.
ok: A Lesson Before Dying was a great lesson. Im not really sure what the book was about but im sure it was good. I didn't really read it so go read it and tell me about it.
NOT ANOTHER ONE: I have read tons of books just like this one. This is just another book written by an angry African American author, who still feels the "pain" from being persecuted because of his race. In fact the author wrote it because he found that there weren't many books written by African Americans in the public library. The book has a few good points, but it is constructed around the whole racism issue. I know racism is a big issue, but what's done is done. OK we get it, African Americans were treted very badly. I guess the author didn't have some other original idea.
This book sucked.: Ugh. I had to read this bok for school and it sucks. Preformatted, horrible, and boring. Dave is so wrong with his review. The only lesson that I learned is that the book sucks.
Book leaves you thinking...: This was a book you wanted to keep reading. It was easy reading and worth every minute.
Great book, full of emotions: I had to read this book as part summer reading for 9th grade this year and not only did I find it fanstinating and haunting but it also taught me about just how rascist and unfair human beings can be towards one another.
Could've Been Better: I read this book thinking that it would be great. The main character, Grant, is an unfeeling person for half of the novel, and then miraculously starts to care for others. It was contrived. I just didn't believe it. The end of the novel should have been labeled "YOU NEED TO CRY." I didn't shed a tear, and I usually do when something is well written. I would not recommend this book to a friend.
Dull, Dull, Dull . . .: This book is page after page of description that have no revelance to the plot. Had to be read for an English class, and I literally threw it across the room when I was done. The only part I came close to liking (the reason for the 2 stars), was when they were bringing in the electric chair and showing the townpeople's reactions. That was neat. Other than that, I had to force my way through.
Once I went to a bookstore and wasted eight dollars.: I am a student at the University of Southwestern Louisiana, and "A Lesson Before Dying" was required reading in one my English courses (this may be due to the fact that Mr. Gaines is the "writer in residence" at the school). First off, this book does not take place in a cajun community, it is actually of the creole which dates back to the old-south antebellum style of living. Secondly, I have never enjoyed a book less than I did this one. It's long, drawn out cry against racism is as dry as the Sahara, and I merely felt annoyance at the two central characters, Jefferson and Grant, for their reluctance to show feelings toward others than themselves. I'm sorry, but in all honesty, I cannot say that this book was a "masterpiece;" the only descriptive word to acurately describe it is "blech."
destined to be a classic: I read this book over two years ago.....and a lot of books I've already forgotten in the interim, but this one stays with me. Mr. Gaines is an incredibly talented author and he uses his talent to tell a story about being human, about the simple compassion for one person....and the larger impact that can have on a life, both for the giver and receiver. I hope that this book will become part of reading lists in high school and college curriculum...I believe it is that important. Other reviews here will tell you what the story is about....I'd like to simply convey how I believe this book will touch the heart of anyone who reads it.
My review will explain what the book meant to me: The book was very inspirational to me. It made me believe that no matter where you are in the world never forget where you came from. You need to know where you are from in order to get where you are going. I love this book and I would recommend it for every one to read.
Easy to read and understand.: I liked this book, the author Ernest J. Gaines was easy to understand and had wonderful flow with words. You got lost after just the first few pages. A lesson Before Dying has a lesson for everyone.
Segregation and racism present in the 1940's.: A LESSON BEFORE DYING, by Ernest J. Gaines, presents a young African-American man, named Jefferson Cole, who is sentenced to death. He was accused of committing a crime that cannot be forgiven. Grant Wiggins is his only hope to become free. I recommend this novel if you are the type of person who likes realistic stories because the book describes, in detail, how the atmosphere was in the southern part of the United States during the 1940's.
A lesson before dying: ~This novel taught alot about isolation and being alone. This book was very intresting. I could not believe that one man could be charged with murder with no proof. Everyone played a good role in the book. I feel that this novel was explaining the ways of the old south. It expressed the racism that went on between black and whites. Racism is still expressed today. If I was Jefferson I would feel intimdated, sad, alone, and very angry. Many people didn't back him up at the beging but at the~~ when it was two late they realized Jefferson died like a man not a poor fool or a hog. This book was very infasnating and unique.~
Prejudice Kills!: A Lesson Before Dying by Ernest Gaines shows a classic case of prejudice in that existed in southern states in the 1940s. For a young man to be classified as a hog, and shown no respect is a prime example of the ruthlessness. Jefferson did not have a fair trail. What ever happened to the United States law that states every man is innocent until proven guilty. The outstanding prejudice of the small Cajun town send a man who was not rightfully trailed to death. Who made us God, and how are they to try and do Gods' work. Prejudice is a bad discrimination among people that not only hurt others, but hurt ourselves. Prejudice divides communities, teaches children to hate, and weakens the economy. Ernest Gaines shows us through the townspeople that prejudice just makes things worst. Jefferson was not killed by his actions, but by the prejudice of the people.
Commentary on A Lesson Before Dying: The book was very interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in African American Culture in the 1940's. The part that interest me the most was when Jefferson's Nannan cooked a meal for him, and they got to sit down at the table and eat with Jefferson. At first Jefferson just stared at his plate and would not eat, because he was depressed. This made his nannan very sad. Grant pulled him to the side and had a talk with him,and he sat back down and began to eat his food. Thus, making his nannan happy after all there struggles.
Very enjoyable but I was left a little confused.: Arter reading the book I felt that there were a lot of unanswered questions.I kept asking myself whatever happened to..? I also felt that there was a lot of times in the book were the author was babbling about nothing and it was just not saying anything of importantence. But overall it was a good experience but I dout that I will ever raed it again
A Horrifying account of a mans struggle to stay alive: Ernest Gaines is an outstanding writer.He shows his skills with the award winning book A Lesson Before Dying.He captures your heart with the sad facts of reality,but on doing so he also leaves behind a lesson.The book is profound,it captures your heart with the incredible story of a black man who's accused of killing a white man.Ernest shows the mans struggle to come to grips with who he really is, rather than who he think he is.The book leaves you in tears but also gives you hope for the future.Alexius Williams
Excellent Book! Way to go!: I read this little devil in less than a day. I found myself wavering between wanting to slap the main character for his stubborn arrogance and the urge to pat him on the back for his sensitive and probably accurate assessment of the state of the black male psyche in that time period. I couldn't put it down and even called in sick to work so I could finish it. The ending took my breath away. Oprah's done it again.
Dissapointed: The product was described as used-good. If this is what the call good then id like to see what they call bad. There is dirt crusted all over the front cover. This will work for the intended purpose (summer reading) but if i wanted this as part of my collection i would greatly upset.
MOCKINGBIRD: It was just like To Kill a Mockingbird, but with even less activity and more boredom. Overall, I only bought it because I didn't want to drag the book around...
Impossible not to be "moved": Story set in 1940's in a small town in Louisiana. Young black man (Jefferson) happens to be an innocent bystander at a liquor store when two men attempt a robbery and gun shots break out. Jefferson is charged with the crime - he is unable to prove his innocence in a town where a black man is guilty before proven innocent - and he is sentenced to death. Jefferson's godmother realizes that Jefferson has no way out of his fate and wants him to hold his head high before his death. She enlists the help of Grant, a young local school teacher to mentor Jefferson during the time he has left. At different times in this book, you are nauseous over the racism - you feel the pain and suffocation of the main characters - you are inspired at their determination despite the hopelessness. The author places you right at the scene and you live this story. This was one of the most moving books that I have ever read.
nothing gained: A PC novel. With the exception of Jefferson, the characters are wooden. Nora Hurston and James Baldwin offer authentic and moving portrayals of African-American men and women struggling not only against a racist society, but also against their people to establish a true identity. I prefer the author's short stories.
Overrated: This was a plodding novel with no engaging characters and lackluster writing. It is nowhere near the brilliance of Why the Caged Bird Sings, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Color Purple, Their Eyes Were Watching God, or any number of novels in the same genre. Somewhere along the line it must have become politically correct to praise this novel, and everyone has jumped on the bandwagon.
If you weren't depressed before....: One of the most depressing books I've ever read. I struggled to get through the pages. I could not wait for it to end...
You'll Probably Read This In High School: I was force fed this novel in 11th grade English. I won't go into the details of the story as they're written above, but there is one chapter that must be mentioned.The chapter titled "Jefferson's Diary" is the highlight of this novel. It is written without punctuation and with no grammatic consideration. This is where Gaines' ability to write shines through. This chapter is a much needed rest from the previous mundane chapters.I did not find the novel appealing in anyway. The protagonist is weak and annoying. The story drags on and on as Grant tries to help Jefferson mature out of his mental childhood. Metaphors and other literary techniques are present, but the novel is so boring that it's not even worth noticing them. The author's writing style is noteworthy, but again the slow pace and seemingly useless details overshadow the style. Don't pick it up unless you really need to, and if that's the case, get some kind of summary.
gave me a warm feeling in my innards: This was a pretty powerfull book that seemed to take a new approach at some pretty old, yet still controversial sublect matter. Its not a book filled with explosive action (besides the first two pages), and its not fast moving. Yet the pages still move smoothly and hold the attention. The book takes a realistic approach at what its like to be on death row, and what its like to be wrongfully accused. How do you change a person who thinks they are nothing but a pig, fattening up for the slaughterhouse, into a man, and a representative of a race. This is the main problem discussed in the book. But the book has more to it than that. It shows the struggle that blacks had to go through not much more than fiftey years ago. It shows how they began to break free of the mold that they had been stuck in prviously, emerging as the great individuals that they always had been.
Cannot Recomend: I was dissapointed after reading this book. An entire page and 1/2 about a christmas pagent!!! I very was frustrated. The idea and real story of the book was intersting. But I felt let down after reading the book. I have read other books Oprah has recomended and have enjoyed all of them until this one.
Very Moving: It took awhile for me to get into this but the author was establishing the characters and it is very important to this story. The end was quite emotional for me. You must read this.
Deeply moving: I think this an awsome book. It had alot of deepth and meaning. All the character's were very well portraided and despribed with the up-most of fellings.
I missed something here too obviously: This is starting to get a little too predictable. Oprah seems to be picking similar books and it's starting to wear on me. I will read this again just because everyone seems to like it so much but after all the hype I don't know. I didn't like Grant as a character or a man and that is a real problem when he is the main character in the book. The story is there but something isn't. Maybe it was me I don't know but this was disappointing.
This must be true story: A man who had to die by death penalty, and a man who had to help another man to be a real man before dying. They were not friends at the begining. But after they spend much time together, they became real friend. Grant was afraid of facing to Jefferson's death. And Jefferson was afraid of his own death. They were black and grew up in the black society, separated from white people. Although Grant graduated University, he was still segregated by the white men. And one verdict charged not only Jefferson's life but also his grandmother's or Grant's life, and many black people prayed for Jefferson when he died. Jefferson's lesson before dying was completed at the ending. I felt so sad and strange after I read this novel. Although this is fiction, I think this must be real.
Straight: It was straightAnd boring I wouldn't hand pick this to read didn't catch my attention like that but thanks
Very moving, somber, opressing: This is a somber book. It makes me rethink the meaning of a teacher. And what will a teacher do if he is still in struggle? A convincing story indeed. But what I am dissatisfied with is that it ends suddently, leaving a lot of materials to be developed.
A truly life-like story!: I must admit, at some points throughout the book I struggled with what the ultimate point of the story was - often like life is. Often we find ourselves in the midst of a situation not understanding what a true turning point it actually is until much later. Grant represents many of us at different points of our life. This book is far richer after reflecting on it than during the course of reading it - just like life!
Not for a 16 year old!: "A Lesson Before Dying" Began with a fantastic foundation, a man allegedly murders three people during a robbery and is now on death row. This is the type of story any junior in high school would crave to read, including myself. Then the actual story begins and completely bores any reader my age to sleep. Grant criticizes society and dreads being treated like an inferior thus giving the novel a theme. The issue of injustice and facing responsibility is a great subject matter to base a book upon, until an adolescent must read it, which is then that the book falls out of play. This novel by Ernest J. Gaines is written with precision, consideration and righteousness and would be considered a magnificent novel by many full-fledged persons, but the second it enters the hands of a 16year old, is the second it is set down never intended to be picked up again.
this book blows: A lesson before dying to me was not a very interesting book. My reasoning for saying that is because the book seemed slow. It was like they were trying to focus on one thing for i dont how many chapters. Some good things i liked about the book were the differences that it showed between the blacks and the whites. The book showed good explanation on how the young black children were educated and treated. In my opinion i thought thew book would have been better if it would have been a mystery of what boys were shot or who killed the boy. That would have kept me more interested then the way this story was told.
All too familiar historical storyline.: Gaines did a wonderful job in telling this story. He made the characters very real, average, every day type of people. The type of characters anyone could follow and want to know more about. However this story has been told too many times before for a reader not to know the outcome. Particularly, a black reader. Enjoyable reading but for my point of view I am ready to read a story about a white man, committing the same crime, in the 1940's or today, with an all white jury and the same outcome. This story makes you ask yourself, does such a story exist? or will I ever read such a story?
Unforgettable: A Lesson Before Dying is one of those rare books that stays with you months after you've read it; the kind that teaches you things about yourself. It is a moving exploration of the problems that have plauged black men in America in the last half of the 20th century. It uncovers deep wounds, and although it offers no quick cure, the kindness, strength, and goodness of the characters signals hope for them as well as for us.
Kind of boring from a 15 year old P.O.V: From a 15 year old p.o.v., this book was boring and the plot was underdeveloped and it did not seem as though the author took a lot of time for details.
The magnificent ending is worth enduring the dull beginning!: Overall, I would have to say A Lesson Before Dying is a wonderful book. It teaches lessons about love, family, life, death, and friends (just to name a few). I was quite skeptical at the beginning of the novel; it was dull, slow, and uninteresting. Luckily, I stuck with it and am glad I did so! Grant and Jefferson, characters within the novel, under went a change that is uncomprehendable. The book is remarkable simply by watching these two men rise to their full potential. I highly recommend every human being to read this striking novel. IT'S AWESOME!
I wasn't impressed: I was decidedly "meh" about this book. I think it addresses several important issues -- the plight of young black men in the early 40s, the state of the justice system at the time, the usefulness of religion -- but I think those issues could have been addressed in a better way. The main character, Grant, is not particularly likable. He's bitter, unmotivated, and at times, just plain mean. In fact, most of the characters in the book are not particularly likable. Most of them appear to be downright miserable. A sign of the times? I don't know, but you'd think *someone* in the novel would be a joyful person. Jefferson, the imprisoned man, is an interesting character, but even his turn-around is a little anti-climatic. With the build-up of the novel and the title and the praise and all, I expected much more of an epiphany at the end. For me, the pay-off just wasn't there. If I hadn't been reading this for my book club, I wouldn't have finished it.
A Lesson Before Dying: In his inspirational fiction, Ernest J. Gaines has explored the most important qualities of soul. Freedom has been a major theme in his works. In A Lesson Before Dying dignity is lifted up. This is a very powerful and touching story. The biggest thing is the lesson it teaches. The reader learns an important lesson about life, family, and education along with Grant and Jefferson. I would recommend this book to anyone, it's very easy to follow.
Audible Version Drastically Abridged: We were very frustrated by the Audible version of this work. It is well performed and well read, but when they abridged the work, they really cut it. Sometimes 3 or 4 cuts within a single page of the original. It is very frustrating trying to follow along. I cannot recommend purchasing the Audible version of Lesson Before Dying.
And indepth, deceivingly long story: I have to admit, this isn't the worst in-class reading assignment I've ever had to sit through. I probably wouldn't read it independently, as it simply isn't my genre of interest, but that doesn't mean I disliked reading it.The book is beautifully written. Ernest J. Gaines is a very descriptive author, with amazing character development. You really gain a wonderful understanding of the characters and their relationship with each other. It is also a great depiction of the time period it is based in, and has a perfect point of view from the african community during that time.However, the book often seems hard to follow. It's drawn out, and you may very well be half way through the book before you actually find the main point of the story. As such, I would most likely never have been able to finish it on my own. It isn't very engaging, although it does teach great lessons that everyone should learn.
This was a great buy: It was easy to order, and a good price. And it got to my house exactly when i wanted it. I recomend everyone who can use the same sender I did, should. I garauntee they will be satisfied.
Not a bad read: While sometimes very slow-paced, I found the book A Lesson Before Dying to be enjoyable overall. The narrator is often pessimistic, and hard to connect with. The characters are fairly likeable, and it's an easy read. Some parts seem to repeat themselves, especially when it comes to visiting Jefferson, but you do see the characters grow and change throughout the novel. Interestingly enough, there are many items that are symbolic and foreshadowing of other events. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good read.
Passable handling of subject matter done better elsewhere: I was eager to read this book after reading rave reviews, but in the end was disappointed with the author's fragmented story-lines and character development which too often dead ended before satisfying my curiosity. I appreciated the authors insights and development of intra-racial issues between Grant, Jefferson, Vivian and the other inhabitants of the plantation. Jefferson's diary and Paul's visit to the school house are powerful images that are well told by the author. Overall, however, "To Kill a Mockingbird" far out shines this book's handling of the subject matter -- and it was told from a white perspective. Nice try, but no cigar.
Is there more to this story than what's in the book?: This is an engaging read and touches on some important issues, but it doesn't quite address any of them definitively. I found myself fascinated by the main characters. I always wanted to know what was going to happen and that kept me turning the pages. However, I was never convinced that the characters Jefferson and Grant were really connecting as much as Grant believed they were. Grant's romantic interest with Vivian gave an interesting human dimension to the story but never seemed an integral part of the main story. In short, I enjoyed the book while I was reading it, but always wanted more information than was forthcoming. Perhaps that's realism.
Good enough: This novel gives a good depiction of what life must have been like for a black community in southern Louisiana before civil rights. The writing is restrained and unsentimental, almost to the point of bleakness. I wish Gaines would not be so clipped and obviously self-edited in his style. Jefferson redeems himself and also the narrator, as well as Paul, the deputy. It is a novel about hope and pride, not just for black people, but for everyone who faces a moral and spiritual dilemma.
An enjoyably fast read through a deep topic: Was I ever pleasantly surprised at what a fast read with such deep implicaitons was contained between the covers of this book! It is set in the lives of a condemed man and his loved ones in Louisiana in the early 1950's. The book begins with Jefferson rail-roaded for a murder due to the color of his skin, rather then the evidence. Even his own defense attorney refers to him as a 'hog' in his closing argument. This affront to Jefferson's humanity sets both the community and him on a quest for respect and resolution before his impending execution. The social injustice is haunting and the resolutions are memorable.
couldn't put it down: This was my first Lori Foster book. I loved every minute of it. After reading it I went out and bought four other Lori Foster books. I like authors who don't portray the hero as a wimpy romantic. Her male characters are more masculine, while still being romantic. I happen to have three older brothers, me being the only girl in the family, so I can also say I like her female characters better, because they are not all wishy washy. I also love finding authors who are as good with the secondary characters as the main characters, and she definitely fills that bill. Keep Writting Lori!
Don't buy this!: This book has nothing to do with branding....You'd be better off buying a texbook about basic economics, because this is what this book deals with.
Do not buy!!!!: I bought this part and installed it on my daughters car. Nine months later the upper fitting exploded while she was away at college. Fifty dollars for a tow and 150 dollars for the repair at a local shop with what turns out to be the same 5 dollar part. When this one explodes, I will buy the original and not think twice about it.
Poorly made product: Do not buy this product . These elbows / o-rings fail in very short period of time (poorly made ? poorly engineered ? ). This part may have a lifetime warranty but it means little if one has to replace them in period of one year or less . The extra money spent on the OEM form GM will far offset the cost in labor and frustration of using the Dorman elbows.
Do not buy this: I bought this for a 1998 Olds Intrigue with the 3.8L engine when I was doing my Lower Intake Manifold Gasket. This elbow started to leak soon after. From my research this part Manufactured by Dorman is know to fail. This part should be bought from your OEM local dealer only!
This sucks: I don't understand how these kids are getting such great reveiws. The kid can't sing and the songs all sound the same. This is a horrible CD and a waste of time and money.
Take them serious? Not!: These guys are music wimps. It's hard to imagine how anyone takes them serious or even listens to this garbage. I'd rather swallow live weasels than hear any of this on any kind of repeated basis. Save your money, Kenny G rocks harder than these chumps.
Funny-Lookin Tots Don't Know How to Sing!: Okay, now my cousin has this CD. And after listening to it, let me tell you, I do NOT suggest you buy it! All the songs are repetitive, and the tunes sound so familiar... They may be cute little kids, but they CANNOT SING!
keep on rockin: i have been listening to your stuff on the ticket 1310 radio station in texas and i must say....at first it was pure comedy for me....or novelty i shall say....but you grew on me....much in the same way dread zeppelin did....anyway....keep on rocking....you got a bright future ahead of you
THIS IS SO GR8! =)=) <3: THE MosS BROTHORS AND THERE SO KEWL! :):) I REALLY LIKE THIS CD! n hehehehehe BY IT! THESE GUYS ARE SO KEWL!hehehehehehehehe .... <3<3<3My fav. is Reubin! And Evan two! Love, Alexandra 11/f from Michigan!
Weekly Vista Columns: The book is a compilation of articles written by Marilois Bach for the Weekly Vista Newpaper in Bella Vista, Arkansas.
Happy: Happy with purchase. The catch seems to be of good quality. It was easy to install and hopefully will last longer than other ones that I purchased elsewhere.
Love her music: This is a great DVD, compiles a group of songs that made her famous sang with other famous artists. It was made knowing she was sick and was going to die soon, so it was like a tribute to her. It is really touching.
Adequate: These covers are OK, but they're a pretty snug fig for my toothbrush. That means I have to shove the brush in, and I worry about that. I wish they still made the covers that had a hinged top. They fit much better.However, this is better than having the toothbrush exposed to my cat, who likes to sniff it and rub up against it. Ugh!
hard gummies: These gummies are hard. Not the best things to chew on. They were pretty cheap, but I regret not paying a little more for more softer chewier ones.
Innovative, Creative, Brings a smile to your face: I wasn't sure at first: hip-hop music with SAT words in it? But listening to the CD changed my mind (and my son's) immediately. The lyrics are clever and clean, and put the words in a context that my son understands.He took the SAT's this spring and he's still listening to these songs. It's a great way to expand your vocabulary.
A must if you love the parade: If you like the Spectro Magic parade that is currently running in Walt Disney World, you'll love this CD because it is the soundtrack to the parade. I only gave it 4 stars just because it really is only 1 song on the CD. Other then that, it's a great collector's item.
What's with the noise?: The pictures in this book are great for my 1 year old son. He can easily spot the fire truck, taxi or police car, etc. But the description for this book was misleading. From reading the editorial review, I expected a different sound when pressing the "tire" on each page. Instead the noise generated was unrecognizable and the same, no matter what page you are on. I thought my book was defective. I would have returned it but my son likes it just the same.
Have a hankie handy: Jill Henry can write to pull at your heartstrings--you'll need a hankie for the emotional ending.Jill's writing seems to be a little less sure when it comes to plotting. Hannah's Heart seems to be made up of two unrelated plots, neither of which could have carried the book alone. She seems to have stuck them together, one after the other. That said, however, the story is still a good read worth 4 stars.
The Scarlet Cord: THE SCARLET CORD by Deborah Raney is a poignant story that tugs on the heartstrings of every woman. I laughed and I cried with the heroine, often seeing myself in many of her struggles and victories. I cheered for her and I understood her prayers.The depth of the heroine's spiritual growth in the midst of turmoil and pain is commendable. She chooses to love, a choice that encourages her growth as a woman of God.Once again Deborah Raney has proved her merit as an inspirational writer.
Life saver: My daughter doesn't like mint so I import Tom's Silly Strawberry toothpaste from the US to the UK twice a year. Not sure what I'd do without it.
A beautiful piece of literature and religious art!: This is THE book to get if you are remotely interested in prayer beads as a form of prayer and/or crafting. As a Rosary Artisan, I found the book to be vital to my craft (and my spirituality) as it reveals the meanings behind the beads from different cultures and religions. The pictures are stunning, the writing is fluid and beautiful, and the instructions/implementations are user friendly.I highly highly highly recommend this book without any sort of reservation!
Charming and funny: This book is a scream, if only for the descriptions of life in the monied set at the end of the 19th century. I first read this book as a child and still think it's quite charming.Plot: A childless young man agrees to take care of his 2 nephews and is utterly overwhelmed by the boys' boisterousness. At the same time he is also trying to romance a lovely young lady, and of course he wants her to think he is great father material, even though in private he thinks the boys are little monsters.You've probably seen this plot in movies and sitcoms, perhaps this book was the original which inspired them.
Hilarious: I'd give this book 10 stars if I could. I've read it several times over the years and my fourteen year-old daughter has read it aloud, to me, twice. We laugh ourselves silly, re-read countless passages and use some of the phrases in everyday life when being nutty. It's such a worthwhile read and anyone with children can appreciate how spot-on Habberton's description of little boys (who are well-intended) can get into trouble (with hysterical results). A CLASSIC.
HIGH QUALITY!: I have bought these bottles twice for my essential oils and give it 5 stars, they have: the right color, the right capacity and droppers fits perfectly. Recommended 100%.
fifth season: good series wish it would not end. i am glad you intend to finish and not leave us hanging. dont kill off people. we get attached to them. some showes find a way to bring them back, time travel has great advantages.
Glad to catch up on 1st 4 Seasons: I am so glad that Amazon Prime was offering the first 4 seasons for free so I could catch up. I love this show. Even if you are not a die hard Sci Fi fan I think you will get hooked on the story that has something for everyone. Sad that there are only 3 epispdes left to the series and hope the finale delivers. Give this a try. I waited 5 years but was worth it.
Love Fringe so much!: I am going to really miss not seeing it anymore after this season is over. I recommend this show to all!
Fringe Rolls On: When we last left the Resistance, they were experiencing the first burgeonings of hope - here we learn just how hard those hopes will be dashed, and how mightily they can rise again.Fringe hits its stride again, calling up questions of hope and hopelessness, and whether the bonds of family can transcend the good and the desperate. While the pacing seems to trip up in places, "In Absentia" provides several emotional thrills with a tiny dose of heartbreak - but that's Fringe for you. Dialogue does the heavy lifting plotwise, but the heart of this show has always been in the quiet moments, the subtle looks, and the powerful cast chemistry, and this episode is no exception.With only a few episodes to go, Fringe promises excitement around every turn, and I am thrilled to be along for the ride.
epic show ever: Very intense season!! WATCH IT!! lots of twists! makes you wig out! jus watch it! i was kinda sad when it was over! i wanted more fringe!
great show with a fulfilling ending.: This is by far my favorite TV show for the past few years. My second is Lost and my third is warehouse 13. I signed up for prime just to watch the first 4 seasons!!
Fabulous: Loved the whole series, so smart, creative and they tied it all together really well in the end. Was great fun, sad to see it end and that's the sign of success to me!
Fifth season requires patience: There's not a lot to say since we are just three episodes into the fifth (and last) season of The Fringe. However, the series has never failed to satisfy. Having to wrap up story lines with the impending demise of the series may mean that early fifth season episodes are a bit enigmatib, but I'm sticking with the season and the storyline, confident that all will be revealed and we have some excellent surprises in store.
Great season: Storyline was really good, ending left you wanting more!love the ability to travel from one world to the other from the special portal.
One for the ages.: As a person who's first science fiction reads were Azimov's "Foundation" and Clarke's "Childhoods End" I thought this show had legs the first year it came out and it only got better.Though I am saddened by the cancellation, I am overjoyed that I have been able to experience the show when I watched it, as I had when I read Azimov and Clarke.So let's go and find that next great show or read.
Excellent end to a new classic sci-fi series: Has JJ Abrams finally mastered the art of the finale? This was a great wrap up to my favorite how of the last several years. Emotionally satisfying, packed a lot of action and thrill into a story that mostly stayed true to the characters' core selves.
Fringe: Fringe has become my favorite show to watch and just had to get caught up on the series before the Sixth Season starts on Friday. If you have never watched before I recommend you watch the Seasons in order so you can follow the plot line that is a little complication and confusing. Seasons 1 thru 4 are free with Prime Membership!
Sad to see it go: Excellent way to end the series! Interesting storyline and plot development. Easy to follow yet still true to the original sci-if premise. Will be dearly missed
Great Sci-Fi/Action/Mystery: This is just good story telling. Shame, this, the final season. Fringe has so many potential directions it could spin...an infanite and boundless possibilities type story. If you like good Sci-Fi, you will like Fringe.
Fringe Fan Forever: Grrrrreeeeaaaaattttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love the Fringe concept and all the actors in it. Each episode is exciting to watch. I own Seasons 1 through 4 now and can't wait till Season 5 is available for purchase.
the show remains intriguing.: Sadly this is the end of one of the best sci fi shows tv has ever had. It wasn't about monsters as much as about ideas and family. This episode is no different. This show is for those who want intelligent stories and you get that here. As the recordists are trying to perserve history by recorning it. But should they start making it? You will find out in this episode. Fringe is out on the edges of tv still, because it dared to stick to it's guns and not become a simple show that was a space opera. I love thta type of sci fi but this type is like the best of sci fi writing , deep and thought provoking.
Great's show ever: I love this series but just heard they end in :-( I just wish it did not cost two dollars.
Anna Torv: I can't believe how many reviews missed the key component of Fringe -- Anna Torv. She and Claire Danes (Homeland) are the two best actresses on TV . . . ever.Torv was the most fun when her parallel world counterpart was on the show -- someone whose every gesture and move were readily distinguishable from Olivia's. And, in either role, Torv listening is more entertaining than other actors emoting or delivering lines. She is THERE and her face subtly shows an inner life and reaction to all that occurs.I'll miss Fringe, but I'll miss Torv even more if she doesn't come up soon with another series that is well-written enough to allow her to show what she can do.
An extra season that was pretty mediocre: I personally believe the series would have been better without the last season. This didn't add much to the show. If you really loved the show (and I didn't love it) then you may like this season.
complete changed in the story: nothing about this season is similar to the old, other than the main characters and some details. its 20 years in the future, but there were also 4-5 years they dont talk about before they skipped 20 years.
A shame: The 5th season its very good but It's a shame that the 1 - 3th seasons have Portuguese subtitles and the others not
fringe season 5: If you loved seasons 1-4, don't ruin it by watching Fringe Season 5. All the parts are stupid and boring.
Quality is terrible: The qualityof the streaming video is terrible. It's very pixelated and blurry, even in the HD setting. The show itself is interesting enough, but I would not recommend streaming it on Amazon instant video. A complete waste of money.
very misl: On the tv it says the complete 5th season. Noticed it was only 1 episode. Had to go to two places to finally see it was only one episode. Who would pay a $1.99 an episode when you can go another on demand service and get all episodes for 1.99. It was very misleading.
Too short.: Not enough episodes! Left me with more questions than answers. Go figure. I guess that is the nature of the beast, come on ...what was it 4 or 5 episodes.
Best Sci-fi series ever!!: I have watched a lot of sci-fi shoes over the years and this one is the best. The story lines are interesting enough but not chessey. The characters have enough depth that you can relate to them but not so much to be a soap opera.
Great series hate to see it end: Really what will they think of next! Been a fan and following this Fringe from the first season! Very little new good sci fi anymore. So I am gonna hate seeing this one go
Best show on TV!: This was a great purchase and allowed me to catch up on Season 5 - highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good thriller sci-fi.
terrific: great plot and writing, acting, likeable characters and actors. The vancouver bc filming location is a great one too because I live ther
Amazing Season: It looks like they had a bit of a comeback this year. Although I love every season, this one in particular is pretty awesome. Too bad it's the last season.
Just when you thought it couldn't bend your mind any more!: Terrific! J.J. Abrams just keeps the creative mind in hyper gear~ this benefits all the fans who like to be pulled out of their comfort zone and into the Fringe!Thanks J.J.!
Love it!: I discovered this show just a couple of months ago. My husband and I then proceeded to watch every episode starting with season 1 up to the most recent episode for the 5th season at a frenetic pace. I am now having severe withdrawal symptoms because we are caught up and now waiting for the next episode that doesn't air until next Friday. I can't say anything bad about this show. It is going to be so sad to see it end. I can only hope it will be renewed for another year.
Final season of Fringe: Things are semi wrapped up in this final season with many jaw dropping moments. I love it and have recommended this series to lots of people.
Great!: Fringe is the best science fiction series I have seen. It has explored every possible cross dimensional platform. It keeps your imagination wanting more. The final direction of the show is interesting and a bit surprising. I'm sorry to see it go. I feel they could have continued to explore many areas and kept it interesting.
Great final season to an awesome series: Cheaper than buying from iTunes, but frustrating to have to pay for it when it was free on TV a few months ago if I hadn't missed it. Commercial free was a plus. Streams well.
Best Series: Fringe is one of the best series i've watched in a long time. Even in this final season it kept suspense and ended without disappointment. All seasons are definitely worth a watch.
Amazon Saved the Day After Uverse Screw-Up: The two show, two hour, finale of Fringe gave Uverse a tummy ache, which in turn gave me a rage attack. Luckily Amazon Unbox was only a click away with a $2 solution.
Outstanding!: The fifth and final season of FRINGE is about 4 weeks away and I keep hoping that it won't end. All good things do end and I will miss the characters, especially Walter, very much. I am currently watching seasons 1 - 4 again and it is going to be an emotional farewell on my part to say the least.
INTENSE: Whoa. What can I say? This is one of those plots that just plain blows your mind! It killed me.Some here complain about the poor streaming. I can only say that it probably has nothing to do with Amazon and more to do with a person's bandwidth. We live out in the rurals and sometimes our internet is crappy, and to watch a movie or a TV episode and have it start and stop a dozen times, is just too much. So, we now start a show and then pause it for 15 minutes to allow it to buffer. After that, it's smooth sailing. I figure, what the heck, so it takes an hour to watch the episode this way, but it would if we were watching it straight from the TV, but we would have to suffer through or fast forward through the commercials. This is better. You just have to find a way to work with the system or beat it at it's own game.
Excellent.: I was unable to watch my local FOX affiliate because of their horrible business policy of extorting $ from (FOX Broadcasting) COMCAST's competitors. AMAZON came to the rescue and provided the series shows that i needed. I thought the price was fair considering others wanted personal information upfront. I trust AMAZON more in that regard.
Leaves a bad taste in my mouth.: J.J. Abrams should have quit while he was ahead. Season Four would have made a perfect series finale and would have ended what had been an amazing show on a very high note. Season Five shames the name of Fringe.SPOILER ALERT:Did you live for those episodes with the alternate universe? Did you fall in love with the characters alter-egos? Were you waiting with baited breath to see if David Robert Jones would actually destroy both universes? Did you have those "Ah-Hah!" moments where past events suddenly took on new meaning with each new twist in turn in the ever-developing plot?Me too.Well sorry, Fringe fans. All of that is gone in Season Five. Welcome to a dark future timeline where the observers are the bad guys and all of the Fringe characters are losing every last shred of integrity and nobility they once had. Way to kill our dreams, Abrams.
Poor.: I think the older seasons are far better than this latest one. The stories are poor and I am 4 episodes in, still not sold on the story.
I love this series!!!!!!!: They just keep you twisting and turning and through in so many great little details for those that are paying attention. I'm always on the edge of my seat watching-especially in this final season!
Best Show Ever: This is the best show! I loved the actors in it. The story line,I hope they will keep going and not make this the end!
Sci-fi Candy for the Enthusiast: This show is a great Sci-Fi "soap" for those who like good clear cut science fiction stories. I have watched entire series up to the latest show produced. The series is fresh and original, and leaves other shows in its wake with original and unpredictable stories. The science concepts used in the show are thought provoking and fresh. If you are a Sci-Fi Geek or Nut you'll love this show.
Fringe last season: Season 5 is awesome!The last season of Fringe, so sad to see it go!I loved how everything came together in the end.
Always rivetted: I find myself rivetted to my seat watching every episode. The action, plot and surprise twist are what keeps me watching.
Too soon the end: The long awaited end? No we could have got a couple of good seasons out of this show. Why are the good shows either canceled or they have contract or people problems ? This show had it all time travel , multi-verses worm holes , alians you name it . What a charming character the scientist was he had a cow in his lab he milked . Weird yes but charming too . Who would think of a cow ? " yea a show about time travel a multiverse oh ya a cow;) " funny stuff but at the same time brilliant . Loved it bought all seasons had to have it on dvd just in case they take it off amazon prime .
I Love this Show.: I purchased season's 1-5. My whole family loved the show. We all watched it together, very interesting and entertaining. I hate that it is over.
Loved it: Flat out, we just loved Fringe, it was a great series although it did begin to drag out a bit at the end.
Love Fringe wish it were not ending.: The only reason I gave this a 4 star rating is because I have not seen the last 2 episodes but I am sure the rating will be a 5 star once I have seen them. The series ended too soon for me. Would be cool if the 5 main stars could have a spin off where they work independantly of the Government.
Consistently Good: Fringe has been consistently good throughout it's run and the 5th season is not different. It does suffer a bit from aimlessness as wanders towards it's final conclusion. A lot of very interesting storylines are only touched on briefly and then left by the wayside in favor of plot advancement.
Very exciting: Fringe is one of my favorite shows. I'm a big Fringe fan so this was great. I enjoyed every minute.
A great series: A fantastic shortened season so far, stuck in 2036 the Bishop's are intent on retrieving Walter's plan and saving the world one final time.
It's all wrapped up!: They did an excellent job of tying up all the loose ends and using the story from all five seasons in their final go.
Love this series: One of the many perks of being a Prime member :) Spent lots of time with my boys (16 and 17) watching this series. Good Dad/kids time and definitely good guy time.
Satisfactory ending to a quality series: This season starts a little slow, but a few episodes in the viewer is again fully invested in the Fringe team. The writers do a good job of wrapping the series up with a few surprises along the way.
Best Sci-Fi show I've seen so far. I dream in Sci-Fi now!!: Great and beautiful actors, multiple story lines and always edge-of-your-seat action and adventure. Walter is my favorite scientist and wry gentleman.
Sci fi at its finest.: This is the greatest sci fi series ever. I have watched all five seasons and feel like I know the characters. I am going to really miss it. The fifth season was quite different from the other four but still just as good.
Perfection: I cant express in words the emotions this show has made me feel, one of the best show on tv i have ever had the privlege of watching. So sad to see it end :(, thank you fringe team for keeping me on the edge of my seat episode after episode, you will be missed.
Great Serie: I Like the turn in the serie, is a great science fiction work. Everything is done the right way, I love it,
If you are a fan of great scifi, then the entire Fringe series is worth watching. You'll get hooked.: This is a great series. I just discovered the program and have watched one episode after the other on my PC and Kindle. I'll be sad to see the series end at the end of this season.
What happened to the writers????: The seasons leading up to this were phenomenal....interesting, thought-provoking, everything you want in a sci-fi show. This was just sad. Everything that made it fantastic in the past definitely was lost.
good show!: It's a great show, but I REALLY didn't like when they did away with Etta (Liv and Peter's daughter). That single thing really bummed me out, and well, even though they kind of make it better by the end, it's still not the same. Overall...GREAT acting! the best! And great writing (except for the daughter thing). I'd recommend it.
okay: Fringe seems to be getting lost in its own storyline. getting harder to follow with interest - too many nonsensical or contradictory things/events, etc... and even the believability of the characters is losing something
Fringe is falling apart: Very dark - think the show is now riding the shark. Wish the the powers to be would stop playing classic rock to fill holes in failing script.
Great episode but not in HD: I paid for HD and got Standard Definition. Great episode, but I am not impressed with Amazon's HD capability. If you are a fan of the show, you must see this episode! However, I would consider another source to do so.
Traveling back in time to get some Poon: Ive only seen the 1st episode of season 5, and so far I find the whole premise just to silly. Hopefully over a few episodes it will grow on me. But as of right now Im not keen as to how they are handling the "Observers" For such an advanced race, they motives seem contrived and petty.
I think the writers for season one through four were erased from our timeline. Season really ends at Season 4.: Makes the first 4 seasons nearly irrelevant. Storylines from other seasons evaporate...Nothing like the first four seasons. I wish we stopped watching at the end of season four. We were hoping it would pick-up the storylines from the first four seasons but it didn't.
Goodbye Fringe: How sad. They turned Fringe into a dull invader story. Gone are the fantastic events that required the quirky team of Olivia, Walter, and Peter to make some incredible discovery. Walter is no longer the lovable damaged person he was, and that was 80% of the draw of the series. I had pre-purchased a season pass but I am now canceling it. For me the series is already over.
Complete misfire: In the grand tradition of Lost, Fringe's producers abandoned their core audience and went against virtually everything else they'd carefully set up (story- and legend-wise) in the first 4 seasons to create a ridiculously sub-standard storyline, which could be subtitled "The Search for Walter's Tapes." What had been an amazingly eloquent and virile 4-year run ended with the thud of this disastrous season. Forgive me for pulling a Pam Ewing, but I'm going to consider this entire 5th season a dream (nightmare, really) and stick with seasons 1 through 4 and never speak of this terrible calamity (and total slap to the Fringe faithful) again. BUYER BEWARE!
Great show: Loved the show, but it interferred with my kids High School sports so I missed too many episodes and lost touch with the storyline. This is the beauty of streaming video. You can catch up on old tv shows.
awesome: I love this book. I have read it hundreds of times. Let me just say that I love the social issues addressed and as someone who loved Beatrix Potter as a child, she would be so proud to have been a part of this work. So cleverly told, and so well done. His depiction of the Lake District is also spot on. Everything about this book is so organic and real. You feel like you can see yourself in all of the main characters. Ellen is one of my literary heroes.
need to clear something up...: I've seen several people criticizing the cover art of this book, and I think this needs clarifiction.If you read Beatrix Potter books as a child, as I did, you would have recognized immediately that the cover is a direct homage to the classic white covers of the little books. The plain white background, centered watercolor illustration, and even the title font is a faithful echo of every tale she ever published. Go check out one and see if you don't revise your opinion. I was, in fact, drawn to the book immediately BECAUSE I recognized it as a Beatrix Potter concept.Oh, and the story is a very good one, and timely. :)
Fantastic!: I really enjoyed this trade paperback. I'm going to buy it for my friend as a Christmas present, because her situation kind of parallels the book... If you're not a Beatrix Potter fan, you will be...
Makes platelet donation better!: These chews are nice. Be sure to transfer them to a sealed bag or container when they arrive. The bag they come with doesn't work and they get hard/crunchy if they're left in the open air. You can still eat them, but you have to suck them like a hrad candy until they soften up. I find all the flavors to be quite plesant and it's fun to just reach into the bag and see which flavor you get.
Made Me Nauseous: I absolutely can't stand swallowing any sort of pill--or at least anything larger than a Pepcid, unless it has a smooth coating, such as Advil. So you might understand that I was thrilled when I first popped one of these in my mouth and thought, "Wow! This tastes just like Starbursts!" That only lasted for about three seconds, at which point the chewy globule lost any semblance of flavor except for one reminiscent of a gag-inducing chalkiness and became so sticky, I thought it was going to pull my teeth out. So my search for a candy-like calcium supplement continues. In the meantime, I'll stick to drinking milk and reward myself with Starbursts.
MUCH better than the movie.: This book adheres to the spirit of the Godzilla series. The monster is symbolic of the threat of nuclear war, as in the original film. The appearance of a great many other Toho Productions monsters brings back many green memories of my childhood; Saturday night horror movies and the giant rubber monsters that dominated them. The scripts were good, though. The new film, by contrast, had great F/X, but a rubber script, if you get my meaning.:-(
Pretty good ,but not the best: This book is pretty good but not as good as Marc Cerasini's other books. It does have some good parts to it. I enjoyed the part where Godzilla battles a tornado and I also like the ending battle with Godzilla, Mothra & King Ghidora. There are some not so great parts to it. Kamacuras do NOT eat people!!!Over all, I thought it was rather like a real godzilla movie, not great but not bad! Dylan, 10 years old
One of the best Godzilla adventure ever.: This book is amazing and my first of reading the Godzilla books. Marc Cerasini has done an excellant job at bringing back some of the monsters from the Godzilla movies. Cerasini's knowledge of military hardware is astonishing. Cerasini also has done a good job at centering the action on G-Force and particulary Kip Daniels. I loved the parts were the military are fighting the monsters and when the monsters are destroying a city. The monsters (Kamacuras, Rodan, Mothra, Varan, Godzilla, and King Ghidrah) are depicted realistic. Cerasini has made this book (among others) a must see for Godzilla fans.
THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK!!!!: This is a good book because Mark Cerasini's got the guts to make a whole series of Godzilla! The story is good, too. I give it two thumbs up. They should turn this one into a movie!
The king of novels about the King of Monsters: As good as Godzilla Returns--Cerasini's first book in this series--was, Godzilla 2000 blows it away! He creates a globe-trotting adventure featuring many of Toho's best-known monsters, but never loses sight of the human element. The reader gets a genuine feel for what it must be like to live (and die) in a world being torn apart by giant monsters. The members of G-Force are colorful and distinct from one another, and we develop a real affection for them and the other characters in the book. We also develop a certain amount of sympathy for Godzilla and the other monsters, seeing them not as evil, but as forces of nature. It's also fun seeing characters from the last book show up as minor characters in this one. Godzilla 2000 can be read on its own, but reading the books in sequence makes for a richer, more rewarding experience in terms of characters.
A must-read for fans of the Big G!: Both new and old Godzilla fans will enjoy this exciting, fast paced novel detailing the monster's return to Tokyo, forty years after his last appearance. By creating an original sequel to the 1954 film, Cerasini is able to introduce Godzilla to new readers who might only know Godzilla by reputation, without having to recap the entire movie series. Hard-core fans who might be upset that this book and its sequels ignore the events on the big screen will be pleased at how thoroughly Cerasini has captured the spirit at the heart of the Godzilla stories. While this novel and the ones that follow are written for a teen audience -- and feature young adult protagonists as a result -- adults will find them just as entertaining. If Tom Clancy featured giant monsters in his books, they still wouldn't be this good! Check it out!
Not too bad: This book was surprisingly good, though I was a bit dissapointed that the book's main villian, King Ghidorah, was only in the last fifty or sixty pages of the novel. Also, I was dissapointed with the Varan monster, I would rather have seen it replaced with either Mechagodzilla or Gigan, or maybe even King Ghidorah...imagine an ending where Godzilla, Rodan, Ghidorah, and the ship Raptor One fight in NYC!!! But overall, a great book. I especially loved how the sub-plot with Rodan was done, and the ending to Rodan's story was surprisingly moving
As asteroids come towad Earth, Godzilla, Rodan and morefight: I rate this book a 2 beacause the monsters were boring and less detailed then Mark Cerasini's third book, Godzilla at World's End. Also, this Kip Daniels goes to G-Force just because he beat a video-game?
BAD BAD BAD!: I loved godzilla returns and was hopeing to see some good fighting scenes in this one, nick gordon and brian shumara (from the first book) only go cameo apperences and that was the first(of many) problems with this book. nick and brian sould have been the stars in this book, but they got the un-likeible, g-force now, and this tradision of kicking out stars continued with "godzilla at worlds end" . and the part where the girl can "mentaly" hear mothra, that stinks! so if you like GOOD books, then DONT get this one.
Godzilla Smashes Tokyo!: Godzilla Returns is about a gigantic atomic monter that destroys Tokyo. In 1956,an atomic monster rises out of Tokyo Bay. It levels the metropolis and returns towards the water. The buildings are left crushed beneath the flames, and many are dead. Now,back in 1996,a 13 year old boy watch in disbelief,as the so called myth destroys the city! If you want to know the ending,please purchase this book for yourself. I would rate this book,on a 1 to 10 scale,a 9. It was very neat, and full of suspense. It is a very interesting book.
My son loves it!: My son has become a fanatic since originally being introduce to Godzilla and monsters of that genre. He needed to do a book report on anything of his choosing, and he chose Godzilla 2000. This was for his 7th grade English class... and I believe that it may be his first book that he read the entire thing. SO, speaking for my son... 5 stars, loved it!
seat cover: When I opened the bag I noticed the blue was coming off the buttons. I think with a week or less in auto all blue would have rubbed off.Returned it. Hope they come up with better lasting one. It would have been the perfect cover for my tired seat.
A Hilarious Look At A Censored Future: Admittedly this is not one of the great works of contemporary science fiction, but I couldn't help but smile reading page after page of this witty, slender novel. Bisson is one of science fiction's funniest satirists since Kurt Vonnegut announced that he isn't a science fiction writer (My humble apologies to Vonnegut - you were and still are - a science fiction writer.). He paints a satirical look at the future that is as riveting as any I've read in an early William Gibson novel or any of Jack Womack's. Bisson's main protagonist Hank Shapiro comes across as a befuddled, amusing Ulysses searching for the Holy Grail (a Hank Williams LP!) in a dystopic American future. I eagerly await Bisson's subsequent efforts in humorous science fiction.
Waste of money: I stopped reading it after the first hundred pages. After that I just jumped to the last 2 chapters to see what happened, but I really didnt care anymore.I read Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451" years ago and loved it. When this book was touted to be similiar to 'Fahrenheit', I expected another interesting romp. Boy, was I wrong.The only saving grace was its alternate chapters where we can read of the early days of the anti-old art movement (which is why I give this book 2 stars instead of 1). But even that didnt hold my attention long.If I can only use one word to describe the book, it would be:- BORING.
Good candidate for deletion: Certainly, there are elements of Tom Robbins and Douglas Adams and Terry Gilliam in this book, but this is less like a story and more like a collection of interesting elements. The plot gets more and more nonchalantly weirder to the point of absurdity, so I was able to skim the last 50 pages without any worry that I'd miss anything important. I believe that the book could be improved by moving the interspersed "history lesson" to an appendix rather than forcing the reader to wade through it on the chance there's something interesting within.
There is very little historic value to this book: I am a historian who a focuses on Reformation issues, and I wrote many papers over the last three years on the history of witchcraft from an anthropological point of view. There are several wonderful studies of witches and witchcraft, mainly by Protestants during the time of the religious upheavals and the witch hunts (Cotton Mather has some interesting ideas). Montague Summers' writings were trying to revive a dying belief, and he was a complete crackpot (no, not a professional term, of course). He believed in witches entirely, though felt that there were very few true witches left. The only value that this book or any other that Summers wrote has is to show how people once believed.
(...): I read a review of someone talking about how this author doesn't understand Wicca... This book was written a long time before Wicca came to be, and before the Wiccan rede and all that other (...) was thought up, so that's not really relevant to this book.
The Author Doesn't Know A Thing: Like I said Above the Auther Doesn't Know a thing about Witchcraft or Wicca...I am a witch and I know that my beliefs are pure and good no evil! ...as witches we believe in the wiccan rede "Harm none do as ye will" in other words Do what you want as long as you do not hurt anyone...and one other thing Witches do not worship the Devil! ...I know everyone thinks that but we DO NOT!...we don't even believe in Satan, So how can we worship something we dont believe in!...Thank you for your time even though i didnt write a review I'm glad I could bring more knowlege to those of you who would like to learn and listen! *Blessed Be*
Only a few songs are great: It isn't as good as I thought. I have listened a pair of songs and it sounded country, but the rest of the cd sounds very repeated, and he has a too linear voice that is boring. Take your opinion.
A wonderful book: I've always liked tapas, but I never knew much about their history and preparation until I came across this book. I have to admit that I've never read a book about food cover-to-cover, but this one was written so beautifully that I was just captivated.
ESPERABA MAS DEL LIBRO, IT'S OK BUT...: I REALLY WANTED TO RECEIVE A MORE TRADITIONAL CONTENT ABOUT TAPAS, THERE'S A GOOD CONTENT BUT POOR ABOUT TRADITIONAL TAPAS FROM SPAIN, IT'S MORE LIKE A "FUSION CUISINE". THE PICTURES AND MATERIAL OF THE BOOK IS A VERY GOOD QUALITY.
It works: The only brand that works. Do not buy generic. I take 2x per day - once in the morning and once in the evening.
Incest, Rape, Murder, Pedophilia: This book depicts people at their worst. While it could have been an interesting read about early American hunters and gatherers, the horrific details of rape, incest, pedophilia, and murder just got worse and worse. I began to wonder what the author's purpose was in writing this book. It seemed as though the book was just a venue for writing about pedophelia, which he discusses in great and endless detail.
Pocket novel: This whole series of books is very interestng to me. The books are in very good shape and will buy more from this supplier.
Very good vendor!!: I received all the books I ordered in very good time and excellent condition. I would use this vendor again. :)
Beware and be aware of the message in this book: Be aware of what is in this book -What seems at first to be a simple story for preschoolers turns into a Christian book that talks about Jesus - Not appropriate to many of us and not made clear until half way through the book!
Beware!!!: This book is a thinly veiled excuse to proselytize fundamental Christian beliefs. If you are a born again, bible thumping Christian who, happens to be moving, you might like your little ones to read this book and gain comfort from the fact the Jesus once moved to a new place. If you are looking to help your young preschooler understand what moving is all about without a religious message you may want to consider a different book.
CHRISTIAN BOOK! BEWARE!: This starts out as a great book, but has a clear christian agenda. Amazon needs to clearly identify this book as a christian book.
beware: I would not have bought this book if I had read the reviews first & realized it's a Christian book. And to be honest it starts out good but when it gets to "Mama stoops to kiss my hand. She tells me JESUS UNDERSTANDS He left his house and his room too, so he could go to someplace new" I was a little uneasy. I'm not a Christian but I think it's a little weird to be comparing our families move to Jesus's death.
Never should of made a cover album: I loved the Beau Brummels on the radio and on TV. Laugh Laugh on SHINDIG, Don't Talk to Strangers on WHERE THE ACTION IS. I remember spending hours listening to INTRODUCING AND VOL 2 and then this came out. No longer on a small label they were now on Warner Brothers. Big deal , this is a terrible memory of a record. I think I played it twice and never want to hear it again. With all the song writing ability from Ron Elliot AND Sal Valentino they make them record covers? YEAH and George Martin wanted the Beatles to record How Do You Do It instead of Please Please Me.
Autumn and Tom and Bobby and Sly , are gone: Horrible record and really lack luster interpretations except for a couple. I mean with Ron and Sal been the songwriters they were, why do Louie Louie ??????? Makes one wonder if Warner who released some great obscure albums in this period really knew what they had :( I'd re-release it as Beau Brummel's 666 as its in the bottom of hell on their recorded output :(
low quality product: Low quality product. Oil cooler fittings leak. Fan screw to short to be use. Hit are condition expansion tank. Do not buy!!!
item was wrong: hose placing was all the way to the right making this useless item wasnt as shown got a replacement still wrong item now im still carless
in a niche` dated, but still like to hear it: I picked it up (vinyl format), from a discount table sevral years ago, because the cover image attracted my attention. Like the jazz sort of, early techno/midi sound. Most asuredly a dated piece of music.
An informed and practical introduction to the developmental art of motherhood and parenting: Life As A Mommy: Insight, Advice, And Ponderings Of A Typical Mom by Cathy Spigarelli is an informed and practical introduction to the developmental art of motherhood and parenting. Deftly analyzing every notable aspect of caring for a child, Life As A Mommy offers readers a creative presentation of 365 entries, each knowledgeably adding fun and innovative wisdom to practical motherhood. Life As A Mommy is very strongly recommended for all parents, particularly new mothers, searching for an all-around helpful, "reader friendly" guide through the often difficult and all to commonly encountered issues of motherhood.
Description of the book from the author: Through twelve years of parenting, I have learned that moms need other moms, for advice, reassurance, suggestions, and camaraderie. In the book,"Life as a Mommy," moms find just such support.Each and every day for an entire year, I wrote about life with three, young children, then ages 2,4, and 6. The 365 entries have a girlfriend-to-girlfriend, conversational tone, can be read in minutes and without guilt, and end with a take-home messages--an insight, advice, or something for fellow moms to ponder."Life as a Mommy" encourages fellow moms,suggests ways that moms can help one another, offers mom-to-mom advice, provides parenting insight, ponders life as a mom, and celebrates the motherhood journey. Support, encouragement, and validation are what mothers will find in "Life as a Mommy."In this book, you will find that, as a mom, you do not walk alone. We journey through motherhood together. Won't you join me?
Danger, Will Robinson!: I was impressed by the motion picture remake of the old "Lost in Space" TV series: the sets, costumes, effects, and other elements were obviously conceived and designed with great care and professionalism. "The Making of Lost in Space," by Pat Cadigan, is a documentary look at the making of the motion picture.Cadigan discusses the process of transforming the elements of the familiar 60s TV series into a film. The book contains many fascinating concept drawings of the visual elements that eventually were used. Many "behind-the-scenes" artists and technicians get some well-deserved recognition.I don't know what the future holds for this sci-fi franchise. But this book is a treat for "Lost in Space" fans anyway.
Poor graphics, imcomplete info.: Many shots in this book lack interesting features and are there just to fill space. Also many images are blury and it does not even tell anything about the movie soundtrack, which I know inclues excellent songs by Apollo440 and a joint venture by Juno Reactor and The Creatures.
Wonderful story: An excellent novel of historical fiction. Characters are well drawn and believable, and the story is gripping. Love that it's set on Cape Cod in Brewster, MA, where my family and I vacation every summer.
Great Book: This is a great book. Well written and holds your attention. I couldn't wait to finish it. You can tell the author did her homework. The facts about that period of time are amazing. Any independent woman would love this book! Enjoy!
Great Book: I really enjoyed this book. It was nicely written and was a quick read. Great if you love historical fiction.
Risking it all for so little that meant so much: It's 1761 in Satucket Village, Massachussetts; 39 year old Lyddie Berry lost her husband Edward to the high seas. Her son-in-law Nathan Clarke and her only surviving daughter Mehitable welcome her to their home. Following the rules of the land, Widow Berry is only entitled to one third of her former home. Lyddie decides to take her third rather than to have nothing. She struggles to survive on her own. Other villagers gossip about her relationship with her neighbor and her lack of attendance at church on the Sabbath. When others would give up and consent to others demands; Lyddie would not. A compelling novel with a unique perspective.
Wonderful: Great detail of the drabness of daily life in New England at the time and a great reminder of how far women have come in the past 40 years. Ms. Gunning has obviously spent a lot of research time on the plight of the colonial woman.
The Widow's War is a wonderful historical novel: I thought this story of a woman widowed by a fishing "accident" is a wonderful look into the life of early settlers in a village where many depended on their livelyhood from the sea and the perils therein. The book was a depiction of the legal system, religion and prejudice (in this case Native American Indians) and how those systems and laws affected women in times past, some with good intentions in mind but, because it put all the trust and power in the men folk, also allowed abuse toward women in general but especially widowed woman. When her husband dies at sea, the main character proclaims war on the conventional rules and laws of the time.This was another's book club choice which is why I enjoy the book club so much, reading wonderful books that I might never have know about or picked up myself. Read on!
Very interesting and eye-opening: A friend told me to read this book and several others of S.Gunning. I was very captivated and at time very angry at her Son-in-law. Which to me shows great character development if you can feel such anger or any other emotion toward the characters in a book. I do have one caveat there were time things and certain issues were repeated at nauseum, which I ignored. Looking forward to reading Bound and others.
Great Story: Sally Gunning is a great storyteller. This book as well as the sequel "Bound"are two of my favorite recent reads.
Cape Cod in 1761: Lyddie Berry fights for her independence in the early days of pre-revolutionary America.Women could not inherit property at the time of the husband's death in pre-revolutionary America and Lyddie Berry is about to face down that law in the only way that she knows how, by becoming a pariah in her community.You will root for Lyddie and you will at times think that there is no way that she can win the war. However, Lyddie Berry is tough and knows how to bide her time and work with the legal system that is provided to her at the time.The ending is surprising and Lyddie gets what she hopes for in the end. A good read that depicts women's lack of standing in early America.
Interesting historical perspective: Reading this book made me realize how repressive property laws were against women in our early country's history. Thankfully, things have changed.
weak plot and characters: I give the author cudos for delving into old historic records but gathering facts does not make a book. I read for both pleasure and knowledge and found no pleasure in reading this book; in fact I got frustrated and annoyed. I truly wanted to like the book. The facts have potential but it seemed the author didn't know where she wanted to go with the book. The story line was simplistic, old, worn and weak. The characters were poorly developed and the plot old. Who in the world doesn't know that women had few rights in early New England?
femme fatale: It would have been good historical fiction if the main character was not such a femme fatale. a little too unbelievable, her actions and her morals. Really a disppointment.
The Widow's War: I liked this book very much. I read it because it was picked by my Book Club and because it was taken place in Cape Cod in the 1700's. It was really interesting because of the history involved. It was an easy read and one you really wanted to get back to if you had laid it down for a time. I would recommend it especially if you were going to Cape Cod. Good beach book. Also loved the characters!
A Stunning Tome of Contemporary Photography: Blink proves to be an indispensible overview of contemporary world photography as organized by ten curators. They defend their rationale for selection and the 100 photographers clearly serve to define where this art form currently exists. This is not a retrospective but an introspective look at how and why. The images are exciting and the dialogue is cogent. This is the best photographic book in recent memory.
Not worth it...: I found this book a waste of money and time. It's a shame because other reviews led me to believe it was something special. Big disappointment. My loss was minimized though, since I bought it used at a relatively reasonable price.
scorpgemi: I don't own this comp. I'd like to but for the price I'd just as quick pick up something else. I'd like to point out that many of these tracks can be had on the "Best Of" comp for Scorpgemi Records. If Disco Juice has the tone of that comp then if might be worth it. I'm going to wait though.
anytime anywhere: Very well put together compilation, smashing old disco prejudice. Disco is good, and albums like these will revive it quicker
if you are convinced of the evolution of the species: The last two pages of the book explain why the human species does not have time to evolve a method of conflict resolution. The wolf survives mortal combat by "turning the other cheek", a behavior developed over many, many years. Humans enter combat with weapons that are not a part of their anatomy so the evolution of one on one response is not available. A learned method of conflict resolution is necessary.
Highly rated...for a different reason entirely: This book is an established classic. It's beloved by animal lovers the world over. Many of the observations therein are fascinating.And some of them are just plain hooey.Love it or hate it, you have to at least appreciate an author to dedicates himself so enthusiastically to anthropomorphizing animals to within a micrometer of their species' limits. The degree to which Lorenz interprets the intentions of his animals is positively breathtaking.It's an enormously fun read, but for your own sanity, take his conclusions with a small dose of caution.
how I got hooked: I read this book while in high school and it prompted me to explore zoology. I recieved a BS in Zoology in 1969 and haven't looked back since. I suggest any parent to give this book to their child/children....it is mesmerizing. I now have geese to share with my grandchild and she dearly loves them.

Pure Bobby Womack: If you love Bobby Womack you should check this out and I know you will not be disappointed.
Dishonesty: This product was purposely advertised under edition 11 while it is in actuality a 7th edition. Not only that, it is not even cost accounting but Financial accounting. To make matters worst the seller was not helpful at all and blamed everything on Amazon. I am doing my second masters and therefore not new to Amazon; so blaming such an institution is no justification for an inherent dishonesty. There was no CD package as well and therefore the only thing that matched to the discreption was the authors. Proof of this persons dishonesty is that on Amazon you can buy the same book he sold me at $2 while he sold (cheated) the book to me for $20 something. I strongly advise no one to buy from this person. If there was any lower rating than 1 I would definetly have given him that as rating "1" is too high of a scale for this persona.
Unhappy: The product has not arrived. I received an e-mail stating that it should arrive 9/22 or 9/23. As of 9/25, it has not arrived.
Don't buy from college books direct: After ordering, I received a refund the next day. What is up with that?
i wouldn't recommend it to anyone at all: i've never seen such a poor book before. it is poor organized. and i got after 25 days from my order date.
thank you: the book was in excellent condition. I received it a couple of days after I ordered it. Thank you for saving me money and time!!!
ink won't flow: This is such a fun and creative kit that my 10 and 13-year old sons would be crazy about if the small ink pens come with the book would flow. It is very bothering that only 3-4 ink pens out of 20 (therefore the colors are limited) were able to flow without clogging. We were totally frustrated.
Don't waste your money: I bought several items looking to get something similar to the old spirograph, which I could never do as a kid. Guess what, still can't!
Fascinating and wonderfully entertaining: What a lovely overwiew of Celtic culture. The author alternates between short, intriguing essays on Celtic society and traditions, and actual Celtic stories. The ballance is perfect. The reader is given just enough background to understand each story. By the end of the book, though, a detailed impression of these remarkable people has been woven. The shcolarship is never pretentious or dull, and the stories are told with a sensitivity that avoids any awkwardness in dealing with subjects like magic. The stories are products of the Celtic culture and are presented in that context. They appear, not as childish fairy tales, but as rich and vibrant reminders of a culture that thrived in Britain for about a thousand years.
Pictoral oveview of Celtic history: This book is a visual delight to anyone curious about the Celts.It includes little known legends ,and lavish illustration.There are few books that provide such a vivid doorway,to the shrouded past.
sweet little doll: After looking around quite a bit, I decided to order this doll for my 18 month old daughter. She likes to sit and give the dolly her Baba. I was able to get a fake bottle for $1 at the "Dollar Store" where we live.I had a couple of requirements for such a doll.1. It doesn't pee. I have enough of changing diapers as it is, and don't really want to have to deal with it on a doll.2. Wasn't so life like that it was creepy. My daughter was a preemie and 15" long when she was born. I wanted a doll that was smaller than that and didn't remind me of that difficult time when my daughter was born (sort of like, "Holy Mackerole! She was *that* small when she was born!?")This doll met all the requirements. It's easy for my petite toddler to carry around and love on. I like her a lot and recommend her to others.
Sweetest baby doll: I ordered this for our 8-month-old. She loves it more and more each day. It has quickly become her transition toy for naps and nighttime. The brilliant colors, the soft velour and the sweet face make it a perfect first "baby" for a baby.
Must Have Doll: I bought this doll for my 7 month old granddaughter last Christmas. She will not go to sleep without her. She has been wagged every where and still looks new. The entire doll is machine washable and air dry only. Getting her away long enough to wash and dry is a problem, so she is getting another one this Christmas for the car and on wash days. Love this little doll.
Baby Corolle: I bought this baby for my 12 month old daughter for Christmas. She is now 14 months old and is playing with "Baby Cora" more. She loves to squeeze her, suck on her hand, and throw her over the pack and play. I think this product is well made. The shape and softness of the doll's body is perfect for a baby to hug and squeeze. Despite the Amazon picture showing the doll with her finger in her mouth, we have never been able to get "Baby Cora" to do this, but that is not a big deal at our house. Overall, I think this is a great little doll to add to any baby's collection.
Soft and cudldy.: One of serveral Corolle dolls I have purchased for my toddler grand daughter. They're all unique.
Step away from this book!!: Yawn..............I used to enjoy Silverberg's books and stories. What has changed? Not very well done. I cannot recommend this.
Roma Insomnia: The only reason I ever finished this book is because I used it as a sleep aid when I could not sleep. Forget about tylenol pm....try a little "Eterna"......
Five stars: It is great to read about a strong yet vulnerable woman making it on her own in difficult circumstances in a a challenging climate.
A Cold-Blooded Business: I enjoy your characters. Plus the addition of history about Alsaka brings it to life along with heritage of the natives.
A Cold Blooded Business: I really enjoy each of Kate Shugak 's books. I like her spirit and personality. I also really like how Mutt is written in her stories. A cold Blooded Business is equally enjoyable as rest of her other books.
Exciting, thrilling, captivating, and lots of fun.: When I grow up I want to be Kate Shugak. I want to befiercely independant, pretty, strong and intelligent. I want to work for money when I need it at the jobs I choose. I want to be able to live off the land and live in the middle of nowhere. I want a beautiful fierce dog at my side. I want the relationships in my life to be by their own rules. I want to live an unboring life of excitement, whether it's dangerous or peaceful.Never mind that Kate is two years younger than I am now,I want to be her when I grow up!
Oil on the Tundra: A COLD-BLOODED BUSINESS by Dana Stabenow may be the weakest story in the Kate Shugak series. The discovery of oil brought more people to Alaska than the Gold Rush, but the crooks must vie with the homesteaders to make a life in the frozen north. As always Ms. Stabenow provides the exact details to open the doors for the reader to the promise land. With A COLD-BLOODED BUSINESS, those details have intruded on the story telling.Drugs and stolen native grave tokens vie for the front seat in a land where there is no margin for error. It is a little plodding, but still a good read for Kate's fans.Nash Black, author whose books are also available in Kindle editions.Writing as a Small BusinessSins of the Fathers: A Brewster County NovelNatchez Above The River: A Family's Survival In The Civil War
Exhaustive, but exhausting: Delves deep into the legacy of the Cardinals for classic contests, but the writing is dull, cliched, and windy.
hello world: This book provided a pretty good overview of diving and snorkelling in Puerto Rico. We picked two diving sites and one snorkelling site based on it. It over-estimated the difficulty of one of the dives, and did not warn us about several factors that degraded our diving experience.
A good general guide: This book does have some great tips but when it comes to specific locations it falls short. When I went to several towns looking for the locations mentioned in the book, I fould many locals unaware of them. Some have never heard of them and I could never find the location. Maybe if a specific departure location was givin (city or port) instead of a bay or area, would be helpful. Great photography by the way.
Cracks easily, but the price makes that irrelevant: There's not a lot to say about this item, but I will include these points:- End stays screwed on relatively well- WILL crack if you bite on the balls accidentally- Does not irritate or inflame tongue- Not uncomfortable to wear
Meh. Not so cold.: I bought a couple of these for shin splints. They're a good idea but not very well executed. They're difficult and awkward to get on. It's basically an ice pack inside a stretchy sleeve as opposed to a single integrated unit. The ice pack is only sewn to the sleeve at the very top and bottom, so the rest of it is loose and likes to bunch up. Also, it never feels particularly cold, even fresh out of the freezer. It's cold, yes, but it's almost like it's so insulated that you can't feel it very much. Doesn't last very long either. I like the idea of compression + cold, and this delivers on the compression, but not so much on the cold. Better than nothing, I'm sure, but I'm now shopping for something better.
Disappointed: These Shin Ice sleeves are a great idea, however I think buyers should be aware of a couple of things... Definitely buy a size larger than you think you will need. These are very hard to pull on, especially when frozen. There is much too little "ice" in the sleeves. Not nearly enough to give shins a good icing for 15 minutes. Loses coolness rather quickly.
Great idea, poor implementation: As a guy who used to syran wrap frozen peas to his shin, this seemed like the perfect device. The neoprene sleeve holding an icepack to my shin was a nice step up. It worked great for about a week, then one of the ice compartments started to leak, then another, then another. After a couple of weeks, only about half the ice compartments had fluid left. Nothing was obviously poking holes in the ice pack, so I can't figure out where the leaks came from. My guess is that an improvement in the plastic quality/thickness for the icepack would solve the problem. Overall a great idea, if only it were more durable.
Not what I had hoped: This product is ok, however there are a few things I didn't like about it:1. The ice pockets are so small that they warm up easily after being put in the fridge (as suggested by product pamphlet).2. If you do freeze it to avoid that first problem, the sleeve is very inflexible and consequently incredibly difficult to put on.3. I felt that it was smaller than listed on the site. I'd go a size up and if it's too big, you can always still use it lying down or duct tape it to fit better. I can't really use mine!
Works great just needs to be broken in a time or two: I agree this product is a little difficult to get on the first few times but after that it is perfect. It stays snug and cold. I bought the other shin ice that wraps around and it doesn't seem to be very cold. This one stays cold longer. All it needs is a couple times of stretching it around your calf and it will fit. I have large calves for a woman and it works great now
Great idea, but...: Make sure you measure exaclty. If you measure too small it wont fit over your foot. Then in order to fit over your foot, you get a larger size and it is too big for your leg. Not enough compression. Didn't hold ice cold long enough for me, might be long enough for you.
Speaks Directly To The Inner Person: I found this book uplifting beyond comment - although Anna's personal turmoil, her claustrophobic environment, and the tragedy of the story don't necessarily support the word "uplifting", Anna's determination, willingness to grow and escape limitations, and her unspoken desire to know life as Divine was just what my own hungry soul needed to read. Trollope has once again presented a real woman from the very inside out.
Rare insight into - and development of - a woman's issue: The Rector's Wife is a wonderful story. Yes, there is the occasional glitch; yes it may seem that a deus ex machina delivers Anna from her major problem. But the story is absolutely fascinating. It takes you into one family, into one woman's mind and heart, in an unforgettable manner. Rich characters and understanding. I absolutely fell in love with Anna. (And her unappreciative husband made me appreciate mine all the more.) A good read.
Soap Opera in a Box: To her credit, Trollope does give us insight into the isolation and invisibility of the life of a rector's wife in a small town in England. However, most of her characters are not developed, so that there are no grounds for the actions they take. The tidy way she gets Anna out of her troubles in the end could land her a job writing for "The Young and The Restless".
The thinking woman's Danielle Steele: This is drama with well drawn characters that I can relate to and care about. I especially enjoyed the main character's self growth. This rector's wife realizes that her life is a poor fit for herself and her youngest child, who still lives at home. The steps she takes to find meaning and make a better life for herself and her daughter were realistic and, because they were realistic, inspiring. I really connected with this book!
Good beginning and middle, disappointing ending: This story of a frustrated rector and his equally frustrated wife is realistic, but also quite witty. The main character has always thought herself as a captive of her husband's fate, however, when one of her children is bullied at school and finances do not allow a transfer to another school, she takes matters into her own hands. As she changes, so do the attitudes of people toward her. Unfortunately, as events approach an inevitable (probably explosive) confrontation between husband and wife, the author creates a truly disappointing "cop out" and, in my opinion, unrealistic ending
A Mindless Read: What a waste of time! And I read the whole thing...why? Maybe because I wanted to see if it would get any better but it didn't, and I dislike giving up on a novel. Another shallow tale which jumped from one fanciful event to another. How convenient an ending for Anna to "get on with her life" minus the difficulties of a loveless marriage. This story is not a reflection on what real life is all about (I hope) but maybe I wasn't in the mood for escapist literature.
Badly made: This doll is so badly made that her lipstick doesn't match the contour of her lips, yack. I would have expected Mattel to do a better job. It was a great disappointment for the receiver.
Great Item and great seller: The NFL shop did not have it but I found it here. It arrived as sheduled and was the exact gift my son had asked for.
blinky eyes: hey,got this kit like over a mth ago. fairly easy to put together the eyes are amazing I've had it on for like during the day and no prob so far the modes are nice i keep it on the mostly on mode. bright leds the leds tent to flicker a bit at times from the light sensor I'm guessing. patterns are random and are nice umm not much more i can say I'm using and old power supply from a cordless phone so yeah great kit very good quality of board.
Sickening: Reading this book made me feel sick. The author tells you to lie, cheat, steal, forge IDs and other immoral things. The few good tips in the book cannot make up for this.Don't waste your money on this book.Better get a well rounded book about job-hunting like What Color Is Your Parachute by Richard N. Bolles.
Great selection: I have been a great Tezuka fan for such a long time. So I was extremely happy to see one of his best series translated into English. Unfortunately, a cartoon is still considered as something for kids in majority of people in the States. If you are one of them, please consider Tezuka manga (comics) as a new media, novels drawn in pictures. It is a new media that enables you to enjoy a story without sitting in front of a TV, or saving your time to go to a cinema, or taking less than half of your time to read a novel. Once again, this is not for small kids. This story deals with some deep issues, such as meaning of life.
Tezuka for Mature Readers: I have been a Tezuka fan since long, but this is the first time I buy a manga (comic book), and the first time I get to know the character of Black Jack.I really recommend this one for mature readers, since the topics are adult oriented and hard to take for children. Tezuka is a master of meaningful storytelling, combining beautiful artwork, innovative camera angles and interesting, compelling stories portraying deep characters.I will pick up the other volumes on this collection. The price is great for the amount of stories you get.
A Black Poetry Lover's Number One: I came across this book in the library way back in the early 90s and loved it so much I would read and read it over and over again through the years. I loved it so much that I started a blog A Negress Speaks... ([...]), where I would randomly select a poem and discuss it and tie it in with something going on in my world or something from my past. I have loved poetry since Ms. Foster had us to memorize and recite Robert Frost's "Stopping By The Woods on A Snowy Evening" when I was in the sixth grade.American Negro Poetry: An Anthology (American Century)This book cemented a deep love of Black History and Poetry. This is a wonderful gift for any poetry lover.Also check outThe Poetry of Robert Frost: The Collected Poems, Complete and Unabridged.
Disappointed: I have other malibu solar lights in my foundation and they are beautiful. I purchased these to go along the fence in my backyard. They are poorly made, noticeably smaller and shorter than my other sets, and give very little light. Extremely disappointed.
Excellent Solar Product: I modified these lights to be mounted on the posts of the deck I recently built. The lights are approx. 3' off the deck floor and when lit they give off a nice subtle glow that creates an enjoyable ambience sitting on the deck on a warm summer evening. The design of these lights to run off of a single LED (Light Emitting Diode) is impressive. The globe refracts the light out away from the unit in a circular area and gives you the maximum benefit from the LED. Also on a good bright sunny day these units will charge and stay lit all night. Kudos to Malibu for such a great product. And Kudos to Amazon for an excellent price.
Barely any light from these!: This is really a lousy product. It barely lights up a walkway and it maybe stays lit for 3 hours after it gets dark, at the most. It looks good out of the box, but these lights couldn't brighten a 2 ft wide box! Don't buy this!
Solar lights verus shady areas: Solar lighting doesn't work unless you have direct sunlight most of the day, batteries do not recharge enough during the day to get more than 2-3 hrs lighting at night. I'm going back to the low watt wired lighting.
Poor Quality -: although very attractive, they don't seem to hold a charge real well. I set them up in the yard, they get full 8 hours of sun, but only light for about 2.5 to 3 hours. Very dissapointing
Walk the line: After hearing Mr. McLaughlin I decided to read his book. Unfortuantely for Mr. McLaughlin, from what I have observed of him he does not live what he writes. For better reading I would suggest Tony Evans.
If but ONE idea from this book proves worthwhile ...: If but ONE idea from this book proves worthwhile, it's worth the purchase price to a parent of a teen who's on the way to a life of trouble.The author knows this, and she writes from personal experience in 2 Late 4 Time Out.As a father of a teen myself, I can easily empathize with anyone who is faced with a child who's faced with the difficult decisions young people have to make in today's world.The media, social mores and peer pressure are stacked against parents, who all too frequently find their teens at a crossroads -- one which may well determine the rest of their lives.The typical home computer is among the best tools one can use to find good information, communicate with experienced people and find solutions, and that premise is central to the hundreds of offerings in 2 Late 4 Time Out.If but one idea pans out for a parent, it's well worth the purchase of 2 Late 4 Time Out.
waste of money: This book is a waste of words.It dose'nt take a geneious to know how to deal with your teens.All information is free search the web.I believe Mrs. Shaw is trying to make money .I am a resident of N.E.L.A. Ive heard what Mrs. SHAW has done to the artist Mr. Aldana, she not only slanderd his name ,she also has'nt payed him for his illustrations. Mr.Aldana is now a well respected latino artist he once was a active gang member ,ex-drug addict and ex-felon.Mr.Aldana has come a long way to find his place in the society ,just the thought of Mrs.Shaw's few words makeing Mr.aldana sound like he's commited a crime against children.What a terrible thing to do to a person.I think Mrs. Shaw should find some other kind of work .MAYBE SHE SHOULD GO BACK TO REPAIRING SHOES :)
Inaccurate rubbish with a slanderous twist: I found most of this book to not have only been written in hurry but I also found inaccuracies within its context. I implore this author to research her facts and take time to edit her own mistakes.Not only is this book poorly written and researched she has slandered the artists of her illustrations by accusing him of crimes against children, which has caused the artists to only lose his job but had compromised his reputation which he has worked so hard to build....
Finally comming to the lime light: I hadn't heard of Elivis before, but the cut " Tu Sabes Bien" is sensational. I just got back from DR and that song has been filling up dance floors since x-mas time when I was there last. This album definately makes me wanna buy his first one.
Amazing: This Cd is one of the classics of Late 90's Bachata. It is something that any lover of Bachata will have listened to at some point of thier life or still listen to. It had so many huge hits such as Directo al Corazon, Amada Mia, Tu sabes Bien, and Bailando con el. Even though the rest of the songs on the CD all received huge reviews. And it is an Amazing CD
Great product: I have been using Algae Fix in my fish pond for two years now. I have a 10,000 gallon koi pond with no fancy filtration system other than a couple of large settling basins that are part of the waterfall & cascades. My pond contains several water features, is well aerated and has good circulation. Algae fix works great at controlling all types of algae & is easy to use. Most important of all - I have not had any fish to die or become stressed, and my pond plants are thriving.
Algae fix review: I have found that this is the only product that will manage the string algae in my pond. My pond is about 700 gallons and at its deepest, it's 20". In the summer the water warms, which can produce a terrible algae bloom. With regular dosing, the Algae Fix keeps my stream and pond string algae free.
AlgaeFix liquid is great!: I have used Algaefix several times; it is the only thing that clears up the string algae in my pond/waterfall. Some other products may help to avoid the problem, but once the algae is (inevitably) growing, this product is the only one that actually clears up my pond. GREAT STUFF!!
Works as advetised: Very happy with product. Have used before. The only thing is you have to be careful with the amount you use. I have noticed the fish tend not to eat for a couple of days after using the product
Use at your own (and your fish's) risk: I've used Algaefix for a while. It does help to keep the pond clean. Previously I noticed the fish (Koi) would float up to the water surface, become lethargic, and stop eating, which lasted about 1 day or 2, and then they would come back to their normalcy. So I thought that was part of the normal course and didn't pay attention to it. Sadly, 4 of the fish, including two 20', died after the weekly Algaefix treatment 2 days ago. Learn from my mistake. Don't trust the label of the product. Stop using it.
bad for the fish: I used this product two days ago at first i noticed that the fish started to surface after using it as recommended i had aeration ( fountain , pump and waterfall ) in my pond all the time.The water clears out as it kills the algae but sadly almost all the fish died and others become sluggish .Yes it kills the algae but it kills also the fish .
ALGAEFIX kILLS KOI, DO NOT USE!!: If you want to KILL YOUR FISH, feel free to use PONDCARE ALGAEFIX. I followed the instructions to the letter with plenty of aeration in my 1,000 gal pond. The first three days went ok and the algae was down by half and the fish were not as active but ok. I hesitated to put in any more but waited for two and a half weeks instead of the recommended weekly dosage. Had plenty of aeration. Two days after applying second Algaefix my fish were listless and at the water's surface. I quickly did a water change but it was too late. Algaefix kills the big fish first because they require more oxygen. This company does not care about your fish, just your money. Why won't they change their label and say DO NOT USE ON FISH!
Hazardous to Domesticated Animals: After reading other reviews about this being safe for wildlife, I bought this thinking it would be safe for my dog since I've seen her drink out of our fountain. After purchasing this, I saw that the label says "Hazardous for Domesticated Animals." I returned it immediately.
Brown instead of Green: Pond went from green to brown but the water is still not clear. I do have a large pond about the size of an inground swimming pool.
Don't let the green water get the best of you!!: This stuff is SCARY!! Despite following the directions closely for a 7000 gallon pond with Koi over 15 years old alongside babies that are 2 years old, this stuff cleared the water but made my koi ber ill. They hugged the bottom motionless and would not eat for days. My quest for clearer water will not include this product despite its positive reviews and the label's directions/claims. I'm now looking into a natural algae-eating bacteria that is suppose to help. Also, I'm improving my filtration system in general. What's the point of keeping koi if you risk them dying every time you use this product? I don't understand all the positive reviews. They give you a false sense of security in my opinion. This product needs to be pulled off the shelves.
Works as Claimed: I use this in a 4500 gallon koi pond. A dose a week is all it takes. But don't get slack on applications. It's a lot easier to keep it looking nice than it is to clean it back up again.
don't use!: Algae fix, is a horrible fish murdering product. No one should sell this product - nightmare stories all over the internet and now a nightmare in my tank! My Fish are still very very sick days after using less than the recommended dose. I had to remove my guppies within minutes as the looked half dead, several hours later all my other fish became very ill. I performed a 50% water change and 30 hours later my fish are still twitching and won't eat. They almost appear to be blind. Oh my water is crystal clear but who cares about the water if the fish die! Google Algae Fix dead fish - this has happened to many users of this product!
HORRIBLE KILLS FISH: It will kill any kind of goldfish or Koi because they require so much oxygen, and it depletes the oxygen from the water, it also produces ammonia. You need snails, scrub more, limit light, or clean more.
Algea Fix--works great: I converted a Jacuzzi to a large fountain that sits in its own pond (no fish no plants)and this product works great to control green algae.
A disappointing Cohen film.: Larry Cohen usually made entertaining movies based on interesting concept, and there's nothing wrong with the concept here; a film director makes a movie about the murder that he himself committed. Unfortunately, a good idea isn't enough to make a good movie and the script here is much below average for Cohen and the pace is much too slow. The soundtrack distracts from the suspense rather than add to it. Don't bother with this movie unless you feel you need to see all of Larry Cohen's movies.
great album: all of these songs are amongst the bands strongest.Avon is a track that has appeared in three different forms on two different albums, and is one of their best songs.No one knows however is an outstanding track with just the right elements of what makes a great stoner rock song.Too bad these guys broke up.
outstanding mix!!!: After listening to and enjoying the K&D Sessions, I bought this CD on a whim without ever actually listening to it. I could not have been more pleased. Great for meditating, trancing, dancing, sleeping, but most of all, chilling out! Seemless mixes on two wonderful CDs, each with a distinctive feel.
Lost In Music: I belive the word "superb" would have to be used hear. Patrick Forge is a musical genius. i mean the dude compiles for compost records which is like the godfather of chill as far as i'm concerned. This cd is so heavy, no wonder it's outta stock. Talk about cream of the crop. featuring some of the finest, most choice hand selected chillout tracks of alltime too. It's compiled in such a manor that you may be pron to zone out, or even get lost in a joyful relationship with your loudspeakers. This cd makes love to your ears, and your home audio equipment, no joke.If your looking to witness excellent craftsmenship, history, and a rare cd that your friends won't have but wish they did, look no further, but good luck finding it. peace! (cminor)
great ink, great value: it is hard enough to find carts for my old epson stylus 400, much less have them work great.rhinotek has fulfilled my wildest hopes and i look forward to purchasing more carts in the future.highly recommended.
NOT The Dirty Girls Social Club: Unfortunately this book has NONE of the spark of the authors' first novel, which I truly enjoyed. This novel is cliche' all the way in regards to LA, and I didn't find the characters realistic or even likeable. The main character is a slightly self-righteous Mex-Texan Republican entertainment rep/agent, who has recently relocated to LA. If that is not enough in itself- she constanly uses annoying phrases like "geez-Louise" and "darlin'". She is truly a loathsome creature-one of her fav food groups is lard- ugh.. The dialogue is completely unbelievable and the characters do not mesh at all. The only likeable character is Olivia and she is a side act in this awful book. This is a huge flop. If you like the sassy "Dirty Girls Social Club", and you have good taste- you do not want to buy this book! No sass and just plain dull.
Eh.....: I gave this book 2 stars because although some parts did make me laugh and some parts were enjoyable, for the most part I I kept reading just to finish rather then because it was a page-turner. In my opinion it was not nearly as good as "The Dirty Girls Social Club". Also, I know it's fiction and all - but this author tends to give everyone a nice, happy ending in like the last 2 pages... So not believable....
Terrible- So Astonishingly Terrible: This has to be on the list of one of the WORST 10 books I have ever read. I had to force my way through it because I was on vacation and didn't have another option during my down time. I was greatly disappointed as was the friend who passed it on to me. We both concur that one doesn't give a damn about these characters, mostly because the way their lives come together is highly improbable and unrealistic. Alexis' relationship with Goyo...? Come on... not even in the movies. How contrived were these characters' situations!!! If you're looking for a novel that is forced and trying much too hard to appear like a good read, this is it. My only consolation is that I didn't pay for the book myself. I can only wonder if this this book was published in a hurry, or if there was a blind editor on hand. Save your money and your time, people.
Not What I Expected: People should stop giving this book such a great review. The author lied about who the story was about. You barely ever see Julian Jr. or Maya in the book. The book is about Ruth and Julian Sr. and if I had known that, I would not have purchased the book. I'm taking it back to yhe store ASAP.
just my opinion: Even though i love the book, it should been a book about Ruth and the Judge. It should have told more about Maya and Julian story. Because on the back it never mention anything about Ruth and Julian Sr. Just Maya and Julian Jr. so i'm thinking that's who story i'm getting. But overall it was a good book.
What a storm: I give this book 4.5 stars. Great continuation of the Deveraux series. Tall, handsome, black men who appreciate woman in all shapes, colours and sizes. I loved the story of Julian Snr and Ruth more than Julian Jnr and Maya, maybe because it was tagged on at the end, they deserved their own book to flesh the story out or because father finds secret baby has been done to death in this genre? I found Maya to be a bit of wimp to be honest. This book needs to be read right after The closer I get to you which is Paris and Titus story for some of the events tie in.Looking forward to reading about Wade and the twins Lucien and Phillipe.
Good Story But...: I have been waiting for this book for a while, as I've read all of the books in this series. The story was beautiful, however, the preview on the back of the book was not accuate. The majority of the book focused on the story of Julian, Sr. (and Aunt Ruth), which is ok - I just was not prepared for that. The story of Julian, Jr. (and Maya) was not long enough in my opinion. It seemed rushed after experiencing the first story. All in all it was a good read, but only 4 stars based on my comments above.
Not what I imagined: After reading the summary for the book I was very interested in getting to know Maya and Julian Jr. story; however, the book focused on Ruth and Mac's story. Had that information been in the summary I probably would have not purchased the book. I would have even appreciated if the stories were more intertwined, but Maya and Julian's story fel to the waste side. Needless to say I didn't enjoy the book; in fact, I stopped reading after a while. Based on my first purchase of books by this author, I will not be buying from her collection again.
Embarrassing!: The cover of this book is attached upside down . I gave this as a gift, and didn't realize it until afterward.
Better than we hoped: The book we ordered was listed as "almost new." When it arrived it was pristine except for a gift salutation on the flyleaf. We were very pleased.
Great game, although old: This game came out in the late 90's and still remains one of the best games I have ever played. I still own the original version, bugs and all, not wanting to part with it.
The snubby: Good book with lots of anecdotes about the author's time as a CIA paramilitary handgun trainer. The thing about hanguns that a lot of people forget is that if you have to use a handgun for defensive purposes, it will be within 5 feet, and will be over within 3 seconds (on average). Thus, having a gun and getting it into the fight fast is critical, not whether or not you can hit a bullseye at 25 meters, or fire off 17 rounds in a row. Also, the thing most people forget is that during a confrontation, if the bad guy grabs your autopistol, you might not be able to fire it again, because the slide can stick. With a revolver, you don't have to worry about that. If the bad guy gets his hand on your gun, it is much harder to render the gun ineffective.
My Review of a Great Book!: The seminal work on the snubbie revolver providing great insight to its use. Excellent in all respects; I highly recommend this book!
a good read for a classic gun: I think my Glocks are the greatest thing since sliced bread. I trust my life to them daily.So why am I drawn to snubby's? Probably the romance, the history, the way they convey so much without shouting it...they just state their business.This is a great read from a guy who really knows his stuff. It makes me feel great to know more about the snubbies...and there's some facts in here I really did not know...even with 3 decades of gun ownership.
Month to Month Gardening in New Mexico: This book is not devoid of any information. A good start for beginners. Although it is really a blank ledger to keep notes on as one gardens. I would not reccomend this book to anyone who has gardened before. There are some hints and ideas within the book, but unfortunately they are obvious. Due to how the book is laid out, one has to wait untill the apropriate month to gain the tip. Not enjoyable reading. As someone who has read his share of garden books I can honestly say that I was really let down by this one. Try Another.
If you are committed to discovering yourself........: For those truly interested in personal discovery, growth, understanding and a better internal and external life, this is a must read book. The reader will feel the authors passion, pain, joy and commitment to a life full of meaning and value. Shared experiences will connect with all readers at different levels, and quitely encourage deeper exploration into the soul. Whether male, female, an elder or a youth, if you are on a quest for better inner understanding and outer living, you'll benefit from this book. Be prepared to have your inner self stirred and restirred, perhaps leading to personal periods of deep reflection, reevaluation and change if you so allow.
not good enough: The teleconverter is not sharp enough, especially for a high-def camcorder. I made a test: took the same shot with the converter and without; I blew the second one up 4x in Photoshop. There is not an appreciable difference. Therefore it is not worth it. I would not buy it again. The reason I did not return it is my lazyness.
Great product: This dictionary is everything that I was hoping for. It help me throughout my medical terminology course that I was taking in which I was in desperate need of this dictionary.
A Christmas gift !: This has been purchased as a Holiday gift for my mother who lives in another state. It is full of good solid information.
not good: this dictionary isnt good, i wish i could have got regular oxford dictionary, it doesnt have many words, so, iwould recommend to get the new version of oxford american dictionary or regular oxford dictionary.. and this dictionary is huge to carry.
Zoe mini-backpack: I bought this mini backpack for my 2 year old. Another reviewer mentioned that it is really small but that it would be perfect for a 2-3 year old, which I agree. My daughter was excited about using her new backpack to carry her breakfast to daycare; however, as soon as I took it out of box it was shipped in and tried to unzip for the first time, the zipper busted off in my hand. The backpack is really adorable so it's unfortunate that it turned out to be defective.
double check edge quality!!: I was really looking forward to using this pan but upon inspecting it after it arrived, there were defects in the steel on the pan edge by the handle. It looked (and felt!) like someone had hacked at it resulting in metal burrs which literally cut my finger. I shouldn't have to keep bandaids at hand due to a pan. Returned it for full credit but thought I should toss the flag to anyone else to be careful and check the pan edge for defects before using it.
Yeah - Correct titles!: Amazon, thank you for updating the description of the movies in the set. The titles in the collection are great and anyone would benefit from them. The price is also great!
Beware - Wrong Titles: I love Veggie Tales but Amazon has the titles in the description wrong. I received "Josh and Big Wall", "Dave and the Giant Pickle", "Rack, Shack and Benny", "Esther", and "King George and the Ducky". Unfortunately I own some of these so I have to return it. I hope the collection that I was supposed to get does become available in the future.
A Marketing Student: I advised my professor to add this book to his reading list and contemplate making this required text. Filled with examples, this book helps open one's eyes. Another tool to avoid marketing myopia. A very enjoyable read.
Reader from India: Whatever Christensen has to offer he does it in the introduction. The rest of the chapters are merely a rehash of whatever has been said in the introduction with examples. So read the introduction. Then read the "Book Group Guide" at the end. And if you have time go over the chapters.
Am I missing something?: I endured the drone of the audio book. He could have said it all--with examples--in a 20-minute snippet. Just three points sum it up:1. If you want to do something 'disruptive', spin off another company or a somewhat isolated department.2. Since it is innovative and therefore untested, be aware that you cannot project customer reaction in advance [no-brainer]. Refine the product by observing how your customers are using your product [another no-brainer].3. An organization's capability to go ahead with something innovative is to consider its 'RPV': resources, processes and values.Despite the examples, the book comes across as a lot of theory. And it really does not have tangible or practical solutions that one can start applying right away. We all know dilemmas; we want solutions.
Brilliant!: This is possibly the best book on the impact of technology in business that I have read. The fact that this book has been extremely well researched makes it extremely credible. Couple that with an extremely comfortable writing style and persuasive arguement and you have a book that will not let you sleep until you are finished.Most books on the subject are based on anecdotal evidence. This work is based on substantive research.This work provides a very persuasive reasoning as to why businesses struggle with certain technological changes.I definitely recommend this book.
Excelente: This book help you to understand what disruptive technologies are, how do they behave and what can you do, but most importantly, what do not do!Jaime
Critical read for anyone in consumer technology: A book that leaders of every large organization should read. Really highlights the importance of staying close to your customers and knowing their true needs and not just making your product "better" (i.e. faster/more features) because you can. Relevant across many industries, but absolutely critical for anyone in consumer technology.
Totally disappointing: This book is very much in the "Emperor's New Clothes" school.It reminds me of the university textbook written by the professor. You HAVE to buy it because you are to be examined on the contents. Thus the professor makes a fine profit from an otherwise unsaleable book.I found it indigestible, and full of truisms. It seems an amalgam of so many other books. Nice work if you can get it.
Awful!: This could hardly make enough material for a 2-pager. I can't believe people rate this as excellent. I want what the rest of them are smoking.
Can you know what you don't know?: This text goes into incredible depth analyzing the disk drive and earthmoving industries and is very useful in drawing conclusions on managing disruptive technologies. In managing disruptive technology, his prescriptions are quite valid; however, overcoming the hurdle of "not knowing what you don't know" can be so daunting that no action can overcome it. The book is very useful in describing the issue and positioning a business for change given the limitation stated above.
Why Do Good Companies Fail?: You see every week in the IT Industry, companies that were once industry darlings announcing major problems just a year or two after they were at the pinnacle of success. In this book, Clayon Christensen explains why seemingly good companies fail to embrace disruptive technologies. This book is exhaustively researched, and highlights many once successful high tech companies that failed to adapt to new trends and markets. An interesting read for anyone who seeks to prevent this from happening to their company or small business.
Misleading Title: This book does not describe the evolution of consciousness but rather the evolution of unconsciousness. It describes the work scientists have done in determining the limitations and inaccuracies in consciousness thought. This is useful in helping frame something as poorly defined as consciousness. However, mostly you can get this from your Psyc101 text. The worst is at the end where Ornstein introduces a sort of Sufi mysticism as a substitute for the reason he believes is so flawed. This is a poor substitute that falls apart at the first rational question, why should I believe this new system which has no evidence for it, as opposed to any other? You know the book is flawed when a single paragraph he quotes from William James "Varieties of the Religious Experience" has more insight than the rest of the book. Readers who are interested in what Ornstein is trying to commmunicate are better served by reading William James.
outdated: I read this book with great interest because research on counsiousness has still a long way to go. After reading books like Dennet, Counciousness Explained and Phantom Limb of Ramachadran I think this book is a little bit of an old fashioned repeat. Even when you keep in mind that above mentioned books are from the same date of publishing. I would recommend this book for younger with litte knowlidge on this subject.
This book is OK!: Nelson provides an accessible introduction to growth theory. In unraveling the mystery of economic growth, Nelson argues that the key are usually the things that the standard economic models leave out or take for granted: history, corporate cultures and political institutions.
Be prepapred for some reworking...: We purchased this for a supposedly "compatible" gate, and ended up having to drill some extra holes in the metal where there were none. It would not line up correctly in any position, and still leaves awkwardly sized gaps. Granted, after the extra work, it does the job.
sturdy safe gate: This gate extension can be added safely to the kidco gates g20 and g60. We have a very wide stairway and not only does it safely block the stairs, but it is so sturdy that even after our four year old swung on it, it shows no signs of wear or damage. We feel safe when all of our kids bang or shake the gate and it does not budge. I fully reccomend it. It is also great for areas were you have uneven walls or posts. It adjusts easily for different attachment terrain.
very high priced but does the job: all the kidco gates and accessories are VERY high priced, but I could not find anything else out there that was ascetically pleasing and got the job done effectively.
Good extension for Kidco gates: I purchased this extension to work with the Kidco G20 Safeway Gate. We extended the gate to approximately 55 inches and it functions very well.
Build A Wall: I purchased four (4) of these extensions to use in conjunction with the Elongate to cover an eleven-foot space between the living and dining rooms to control the movements of my 10-month-old grandson.These extensions went together in a snap and attached to the wall easily with the provided hardware.The resulting fence is sturdy enough to support the weight of my grandson who has figured out that they are perfect for pulling himself into a standing position. The also provide him a way to watch what's going on in the rest of the house (particularly the kitchen) while he remains contained in the living room.The bar spacing is close enough that he can't get wedged in.I give it a five for its ease of installation, sturdiness and utility
high quality: We needed this gate extension to add another foot or so to the length of our safeway baby gate. Although it looks as though it came with the gate--most people wouldn't even realize it's an extension piece--my husband had to screw additional holes in it in order to make it just the right length. The opening at the top of our stairs was at just the right size to not fit any of the holes this extension provided. Otherwise, it looks nice, is very strudy, and I'm still glad we got it.
funny, smart, REAL book about men, women, and sex: Too many advice books talk down to the readers; not everybody is scared to find playfulness alongside of Plato. This is like hearing what youf best friend's older sister says about her boyfriends and sex: it's honest and funny and TRUE. Great supportive wedding book, esp, for those entering a second marriage.
Not the most engaging book on the subject: Barreca seems to have difficulty deciding whether she wants this to be a scholarly text or a (mildly)amusing collection of anecdotes. It tends to make points that are presented as fact, then backed up by something a character said in a novel written in 1930, or whined by a friend over dinner last week. Occasionally, Barreca makes an interesting, original point but such moments get lost in the shuffle.
Mae a Real Impact: I read this book nearly fifty years ago, when I was an undergraduate at Duke. At the time, I found it very helpful, and I believe it had a significant impact for the better on my writing style. This is not to say that my style is all that good, though I am sure that it would be considerably better if I had followed all of Flesh's advice. I am in the process of reading it again, together with a pair of internationals whom I am helping with their English. The thing I (and my brother) are finding is how dated the verbal illustrations and language are, now that the book (first published in 1949) is over sixty yers old!
Nostalgia: The author did a fine job of recounting the history of the Chattahoochee Valley as well as the railroad. I grew up there and it was so nice to be reminded of pleasant times and wonderful people. My dad was R.J. Morton. He used to take the Girl Scouts and the Boy Scouts on excursions on the Central Park. Some of rode on the red caboose, too. It had a pot belly stove inside and was caked with soot.Mr. McCoy played the whistle on the 21 like it was some kind of musical instrument.Does anyone know how to get in touch with Mr. Gallo? He did a very good thing for us and I would like to thank him. Some, not all of the pictures of Gordon Neal are actually my father.I took great delight in the book. I wish all the railroads could come back. It might solve a lot of problems for a country so dependent on cars and trucks.Best wishes,Nancy Morton Daniels
Workmanship not quite as perfect as the photo: This plush tiger is made of very soft materials and is cute but the workmanship on the face is not like the photo. The face is a little lopsided and the stitching for the mouth could be better. I doubt a child would notice the imperfections but an adult would. Ordering plush animals sight unseen is always a gamble.
Horrible!!!: This was the worst documentary ever!! it was a waste of time in my life watching that!! It was so dragged on and boring there are way better films about graffiti then this one!!!
Boring...: Hard to get through, I was bored after the first 30 minutes. It was poorly written, directed and edited... the storyline just wasn't there. It became redundant with lines of fortune cookie text scrolling accross the screen. Its too bad since the artists represented have been an influence in my practice. If you want to be inspired, Piece By Piece is a great doc. about the history of SF graffiti. Style Wars will always be a classic. Graffiti Verite 1 is watchable.
More Gunsmoke action: Joseph A. West takes you back to Dodge city with vividly drawn characters, fierce action and all the fine citizens of Dodge.I can't wait for the next exciting tale in the series!
One of the better books on Lilith currently available: Overall, the research in this book is very good and accurately covers the controversies and issues associated with Lilith and her history. The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is that it depends in places a bit too much on theories popular with the "Goddess movement" that wouldn't stand up to the scholarly scrutiny that is used in the rest of the book. Also, like most other books on Lilith, the author states that Lilith was once a goddess in ancient times without giving proof of this claim. Overall, however, this is a good introduction to Lilith, albeit a rather scholarly one for the general public.
A scholar's perspective: There is a lot of in-print material on Lilith out there, as well as much web (mis)information. This the best all-round treatment of her available, IMHO. - Alan Humm
A book to make you think: I should have paid more attention when I picked up this book. I thought it said "a ghost story", "not a ghost's story". This book is told from the point of view of the ghost (Frank). Frank's brother, Herbie is about to begin his senior year and he has decided to go out for two sports--football and cross-country. He is now the same age as his brother was when he died.The premise of the book is that there are some things that must be done while yet alive. It is a book that really gets you thinking about your own life and what you are doing with it.While there are no objectionable words, I would recommend this for readers over age 12 due to subject matter. Definately one of the better books I have read.
The Drug Information Handbook One Should Have!: This book is great as a quick and easy reference for what a health professional would need to know about a drug! The drugs are categorised alphabetically,hence reducing time to search through the index. Brand name(s) could be found alphabetically too with reference to the generic name(s) and respective page(s). Information on pharmacokinetics, percentage of adverse effects, probable drug-drug and drug-food interactions are stated too, making this a useful reference!
Nitron One gloves: These gloves are horrible.The manufacturer must have changed the material from what was used several years ago. I used to be able to reuse the gloves a half dozen times or so, but the most recent batch will not last an hour without tearing.I'll never buy them again.
Steve roden is a true artist: Those of you interested in music as an art form should get this record. Using very few source sounds he is able to make a very interesting album. I believe this was the music from an art installation, and you get that feeling listening to it, but it stands well alone. If you are a fan of Bernhard Gunter or Thomas Brinkman this is something to hear. If you are not, now is the time to get started.
Waiting for something to happen in vain: Slow, confusing and some bad acting. Why was the girl in the movie except for her see through shirt with nothing to see. I did not understand the ending. He did not shoot the "man in the chair" and all the flashbacks suggusting he did seems weak. Did his partner stange a hanging somehow with the main bad guy locked up? How did he get away? I am sorry I did not get it. I even forgot most of the names.
Total waste of time!: This is a movie about how to smoke and look cool when u do. Almost every seen of this movie, Michael Madsen is either taking a drag out of his cigarette, or he's lighting up a cigarette.
over the dry side: Louis is as good as usual. Held my interest from the first page. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those who enjoy westerns.
A great western: The springs of justice, one against all, in a community who wants to grow socially, a good theme remarkably well operated by Louis L'Amour. Such a book is better than the best movie westerns.
It's got a Chantry, it must be good!: I have noticed that Louis L'Amour books with certain characters often seem to stand out. It's as though he gave special attention to special characters. This book is no exception. One of the main characters is called Owen Chantry. He is somewhat mysterious, but the Chantry name is quite popular in L'Amour novels. This book was also unique as L'Amour gave us another character, Doby, a sixteen year old boy. Doby speaks in first person. We read his every thought and plan. We see how lonely he is living far from civilization. He dreamed about about a "golden haired girl." We even hear his poor english skills throughout the book. L'Amour is a master at capturing "country talk." Of course the book has the regular bad guys, killing and even treasure. But, this time it is quite different. Get this book and read it. It is short and easy to read, but interesting all the way through.
Review of books i have purchased: I have rated the Louis Lamour books at 4 star because i find all of his books i have read to be interesting and stories that keep you wanting to read on to see what happens .
NO CALL BACK! HORRIBLE SERVICE!: I ordered this and they sent me the wrong poster. Since, I have sent in my return only wanting an exchange and have heard nothing back in return. I have also called their return line and left my name and phone number and NO ONE has called me back regarding my return. The phone message states that it will take no longer than one day to return the phone message.I am very disappointed and have not yet seen my money credited back to my account, nor have I recieved the correct poster that I originally ordered.Any form of contact would be appreciated.
Totally engrossing - Everyone should read it: This is one of the very best books I have ever read. I could not put it down. The amazing bonus is that it is also true and gives tremendous insight into being "colored" in America. I wish that all teenagers would read it. The insight it offers is invaluable. It has a lot of adult themes, but I am going to give it to my 15 year old to read this summer. After all, it all actually happened to a teenager. An interesting sidenote: I came across this book because several of my friends were students of Greg Williams when he was a law professor at Iowa. They loved him as a professor and a person.
Wonderful - couldn't put it down.: I felt so sorry for the boys - they had such a terrible life after they discovered they were black. I have a friend who also lived in Muncie named Connie who knew the family and she said this is a true story. I think Greg should write a sequel so that we know what has happened to his family, do they pass for white now, how has this affected their children. We've passed this book all over our office. It's in our Diversity Library now.
he told the whole truth and nothing but the truth: he told of all his problems, the pain, the happiness,and the sorrows. i really though i was there with him
I never put it down!: Life on the Color Line explores not only the racial issues of black and white, but the "drop of black blood theory." This theory still exists and is legal in every state. One-tenth of black blood legally makes you black! So, how many other Greg Williams' would there be in this world if we explored our family trees?? Are you a Greg Williams'? And what would be your reaction? This story is also a coming of age story. As much of a drunk as his father was, he still managed to inspire Greg to be his best. Greg endured a lot of racial tension from both sides of the line, but ultimately it was the African American side that pulled him in and supported him.I just finished Cacausia by Danzy Senna. This is fiction, but addresses some of the same issues. In this book the character knows they're black, but must pretend she is jewish. If you liked Life on the Color Line, you'll love Cacausia (or vice-versa).
Life on the Color line: A very interesting & very moving tale of life in Black America. Living in Cincinnati I was curious when the Univerist introduced it's new president. Was I surprised. Inspiring story of how we can all rise above our biggest hurdles in life! A Must Read!
Great book, enjoyable read: The book was delivered in a timely manner from the provider, and I have been reading it in bits and pieces every chance that I get. I would recommend this to anyone...definitely a worthwhile read.
survival: This was such a sad book. A boy who started out white and then dumped into a very bad, black, Muncie, Indiana!!! Not "recognised" by his white cousins ando ther relatives.He survived to become a lawyer and professor.I would have liked to hear more of his adult life.
solar lights: batteries needed replaced when arrived. 2 stay on 100% of the time so batteries need replacing daily.i would be hard pressed to order another set.
Need sun: Malibu Outdoor Solar Powered Carriage Lights work fine if they are placed in direct sunlight,not so good if they are in partial or full shade. In Oregon, 145 of the first 159 days thisyear were overcast or worse. Not good for solar-powered lights.
Corelli fans beware: I bought this thinking it was videos of live performances by Corelli, but this is nothing more than Franco Corelli in his 70's lip-sinching to his EMI recordings which he made in the early 1960's. His lip-sinching is poor at best, his acting is is a joke as he obviously can't express himself unless he is actually singing. It is an embarassment and he should have known better. There is no indication this, that I could see, on the packaging and nothing on the Bellcanto web site. Buyer beware.
Disappointing: I read several recommendations on this book and it sounded like a good read. However, I found the pace way too slow and filled with uninteresting and unnecessary fillers. The supernatural aspect of the book didn't really fit with the small-town feeling I got from it in the beginning. I enjoyed the first half but found the last half dull and unbelievable within the context of the story. It was okay, but I wouldn't recommend it.
I COULDN'T WAIT TO FINISH THIS BOOK.......: So I could get rid of it! It fails on every single level, as a horror novel, as a suspense novel, as a character-driven novel, as a plot-driven novel. The characters are horrible and the story is boring. A boring horror novel - not a good thing. I had to force myself to finish this book and promptly left it in a hospital waiting room for some other unsuspecting victim. Sorry!
Incubus Fails to Sustain: I couldn't wait to start reading this book. Incubus stories are usually filled with sensual feelings and pleasures of the imagination. However, having this entire story told by a minister's wife and involving church members who would never even think what I would have liked to hear was a total disappointment. I returned the book to the bookstore after finishing it. I was forcing myself to hang on to the story hoping it would come alive. It never did.
Deadly Dull: Incubus is scary primarily because it's so badly written, plotted and presented. It's inconceivable that BOMC would offer this self-indulgent claptrap as a selection because the author commits the unforgivable sin of boring the reader. The characters are unlikable, tedious and belabored, and the mother-daughter relationships are especially tiresome. A real disappointment as well as a waste of time and money.
Very disappointing: I was quite disappointed with "Incubus", especially after all of the good press it had received. I have to agree with the majority of the Amazon.com reviewers who classified it as "boring". The characters weren't developed, and, basically, just not much happens in this novel. A reader had compared "Incubus" to "The Church of Dead Girls" in that it is more if a story about life in a small town disturbed by horrifying events. The difference is that "Church" succeeded splendidly with the story of life in a small town, and how there is no such thing as privacy. "Incubus" just didn't move at all, and life in the small town wasn't captured so as to be interesting for the reader. I won't recommend "Incubus" - there are so many books out there that are so much better (like "Church of Dead Girls").
This was not a good book.: This book has a really pretty cover, and that is the best thing I can say about it. There was virtually no suspense, and the characters were not very likeable. I'm sorry I spent the money to buy this book.
Slow Reading; Insulting to Women: This book was quite boring. While the first chapter promises excitement, the plot unravels before your eyes as you plod through this book. Additionally, the main character and narrator of the story is an ignorant fool who is surrounded by people who do not care for her. Her mother rejects her and her husband won't pay attention to her unless some spirit is attacking her. While I felt sorry for her at times, at others, I wanted to yell at her to wake up and get out of that strange town that felt like it was stuck in a time warp.In conclusion, don't bother with this drivel.
Nice story buried by pretentions: There are moments in Incubus that will have you rivited. The problem is these moments are few and seperated by a whole lot of uninteresting self indulgence.While Arensberg can obviously write (there are three great, creepy scenes) her book is bogged down by an over all feeling of "I'm better than this genre". Her best scenes are the ones dealing directly with the demon/supernatural, yet she seems to be trying her hardest to rise above this. By avoiding sensationalizing, she had robbed her story of narrative power.One last note: Would it [hurt]Arensberg to give us one likable character? If given the choice, I would stay in a room with the Incubus rather than spend any more time with any character in this novel.
This book was much more hype than horror.: I love horror and read this based on the review in "The Washington Post Book World". At first, it appeared to be building to something good, but it went nowhere. No real thought to the plot or characters. This is a waste of time for REAL horror fans.
THE BOOK-OF-THE-MONTH CLUB LIKED THIS?!?!: I can't in any way believe that this had the well-written style to be a BOMC Main Selection. I was so, so misled by the description of this slow moving sleeper. In fact, I qiut after about 100 pages. The plot went nowhere and there was too much description. I hope BOMC comes up with better books for their Main Selections, cuz this sure wasn't worthy of being one!
silly, very silly: I don't get it. Others seem to love this book--and I thought it trite and sentimental, almost to the point of making me sick. So much treacle. Yes, there were some nice sentences. But I felt the author was trying so hard to justify her "love will save us" message in the face of such horror, that I sometimes believed she would better have used her talents in the greeting card industry. Yes, I like the bravado of taking on Stephen King. Kudos to her for that. But she didn't do much except rehash an old myth, using sexual and gender stereotypes that defied my imagination. I felt we were headed straight to film. Maybe a screenplay would have been a better choice in the first place.
STINKUBUS: Whether this book is supposed to be a "horror" novel or not makes no difference. It's about as exciting and/or interesting as going to the laundromat. The narrator is self-centered and not entirely objective and there's not really a character in the whole book that I liked. Arenberg spends her time dealing with the sexual frustrations of a bunch of Peyton Place wannabes and her incubus terror is more humorous than frightening. A real overblown farce.
Disturbing but a tad too slow for my tastes: I managed to find the book both compelling and, at the same time, a bit tedious. The underlying story was interesting enough for me to want to continue turning the pages while I often became frustrated at Cora's rambling style of telling the story and her lengthy descriptions of everything surrounding her. Some details were interesting (gardening) while others made me smile (especially those of her friends sex lives) but many were just plain dull. This tidbit, taken from a scene where Cora is describing herself, could just as well describe the author's method of telling her story: "When he (Cora's husband) told me a story I made him repeat himself. When he baptized an infant I asked him to describe the christening dress." (...)Guess this book disturbed me on a level that I wasn't aware of! And, here I thought I was too jaded to be bothered by a story.
Don't call me horror!: To catagorize this book in the horror genre would be misleading and disappointing. Even though something horrible does happen to the women of Dry Falls, fans of classic pop horror authors such as King, Koontz, Barker and Rice might not find the book "meaty" enough. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed this book (even though I myself am a horror fan) and found it a refreshing read since it is rather short. The dialogue is clipped but this may be due to the New England dialect, and by extension, the New England culture portayed in the book. There are very good descriptions of the psychological make-up of the main characters and I found the relationship between the main character's mother and sister thoughtful and compelling.
Incredibly Boring: One definition of "prose" is: tedious speech or conversation. That defines this book. If you like the Clive Barker/Stephen King brand of horror, save your money. A bore.
Not as good as I expected: I was interested in this book after reading summaries and reviews of it but once I had it in my hands, it was a real chore to plod through it. In fact, I am at the last bit of it now, supposedly the exciting part and I am so bored I am up at the computer looking for an exciting book to read next!
Not Clever or Hilarious: Although there are three blubs on the back cover of this book laudings its"hyperliterate wit" I found nothing even mildly amusing and I do read a lot of contemporary poetry. I've read at least ten books in the last three months. Compared to Bob Hicock or Dean Young or Joshua Clover or Steve Venright or anyone else I've read recently, but for a few pieces this writing left me cold.
Wonderful Read: This book is very insightful and made me think about body image issues in a different light. The book does a great job representing all angles of eating disorders/body issues.
Self-absorbed.: Leslie, Leslie, Leslie, a few interviews, Leslie...Yes Leslie, you're thin, you are so disciplined in your workouts, and you wear thong underwear. We affirm you. Now go and learn about capitalization; you capitalize nouns that take the place of names, like "Grandpa."
Disappointing book: The author was far more interested in discussing her own preoccupations with weight and her own looks than in really opening up some kind of valid discussion about body image. This book is mainly a self-involved narrative of the author's own rituals, with the occasional nod in the direction of "wouldn't it be great if women just accepted their own bodies?" The anecdotes are simply that: pretty banal observations without any real content or analysis.
Long time locker room veteran disagrees: As a former aerobics instructor and long time gym goer, I was quitedissapointed in this book. It was boring, repetitive, and in the end, moreabout Leslie then anything else. I was hoping that the conclusion would beto celebrate our bodies, whatever the situation, but I didn't sense thismessage at all."Insecurity" was emphasized over and over again giving readers a 0 message. If I was someone who had never been to a gymbefore, I probably wouldn't join after reading this book in fear that other women are judging me.
Crude: I bought this book after seeing the author on the Today show. It is filled with some humor, but all her talk of thongs, buying a dildo, etc are a turnoff.
Do yourself a favor and skip this one: As useless and bland as this book is, it does teach one 2 things: that you never fully recover from anorexia, as exhibited by this writer's thin-obsessions shining through on every page of this book. Also, anorexia must kill brain cells because the writing and organization and tone are all just so awful.
No perspective or insight offered: It seems like a lot of women loved this book so I will respect that - but I don't agree.Like many women I have had a low-grade obsession with my weight and body but after reading this book I realized that I overestimated my issues.I had to stop reading halfway through because it was just too boring and ridicules for words. The whole book is a parade of people spending their lives fretting about minute weight gains or the C-cup versus D-cup issue. But that is all it is: a parade of people lost to the world in navel-gazing over something truely meaningless. The authors obsessive listing of numbers does not sound to me like someone who has recovered from an obsession with weight and looks (nor does her picture on the backcover). It is sad how small you can make your own world.There are a couple of really insightful books on weight obsession out there but this isn't it.
fine for 2005, but why selling in 2006: What a rip! Selling 2005 calendars in 2006 should not happen on Amazon.
A story of a boy's struggle to save his people and island: The bomb illustrates one boys struggle to save his people and his island from the Americans. They have asked to test their newest invention of warfare: the atom bomb. While growing up and becoming part of Bikini-Atoll's government, he must face a great deal of decision, loss and pain. I recommend this book to people from the ages of 13 to adult. No matter the age, it will touch your heart.
No joke, this is really bad: This isn't a movie, it's a TNT movie. It's ninety-nine percent "Xena: Warrior Princess" and one percent "Caligula" (a weak Roman bath scene with some strip-bar quality women). Poor acting, poor costumes, poor scenery, and a tired plot make this film painful to watch and, for me, an embarassment to have rented. Just don't expect anything of historical or dramatic value out of this, for you will surely be disappointed.
Not worth the price: I study Amazons in both the ancient world and in modern incarnations of the legends. You have to watch this movie without expectation of historical anything -- within two minutes I could hear how badly it would destroy anything vaguely historical. There is a plot and it does circle back to the beginning and reach a conclusion to the opening conflicts but the points between are rather weak. It has a soft-porn quaity to it -- lots of breasts and female bum, very little male nudity, the sex is all distant and softly lit. Ultimately it feels like someone had an interesting idea, some productors messed with it and got their sex buddies jobs in it, and the result is something not really worth you dollars.
Small but simple good amazon movie: When Xena Warrior Princess was over and before the roar of the Lord of the rings I caught this movie and while you may think What a joke!! trust me when I say the joke is on you while it never it relates to xena this small movie does its job of entertain you and see the struggle of the Amazons and the roman empire.So enjoy AMAZONS AND GLADIATORS and see the birth of a new heroine.
VillaWare Pizzelle Iron: Purchased a Villaware pizzelle Iron and it is beautiful. Price was right and I love it.
The Banged Barbie: Her accesories are cute, so is the dress, but unfortunately this is one of the uglier Barbie's I've seen. Her hair looks gorgeous from the back when she turns around,...well, you can judge for yourself. For a small child, she's fun and durable. Her outfit looks great on one of my prettier dolls. On a better note, her shoes are adorable. She has the spunky yellow box toe heel.
Simply useless: Out of the 4 units: one did not work right out of the box and the other 3 lasted for no more than 2 hours a day.
NO LIGHTS YET!: A MONTH HAS PASSED AND I DO NOT HAVE MY LIGHTS. IS THERE ANYBODY TO TALK TO WHO COULD HELP? I WOULD STILL LKE TO HAVE THEM.
Living, Dying, Caring: Life and Death in a Nursing Home: I read this book from cover to cover in the space of an afternoon. The true stories were engaging and poignant and the reflections provided by the authors on each situation are an invaluable resource to anyone working in healthcare.I would also strongly recommend this book to anyone with a parent or family member living in a nursing home (particularly in Australia). It gives you an insight into the day to day running of a nursing home, the dilemmas faced by staff and the quality of care which should be provided. The book includes descriptions of times when a high quality of care was provided, and also times when a situation could have been handled better. This book is also a good introduction to some of the key principles of palliative care.
GURNEY SAID THEY ARE SORRY LOOK OUT.: Ordered from gurneys some things i got and some I did not get. The potatos I got were rotten and smelled so bad ,the postal driver that deliverd them, held them out the window till he got them del. He and i opened the box it smelled so bad he said it may be a dead animal.I called gurneys. and they said sorry. iam getting my c. card people on this. they just don't care.charles
Please, Once is Enough: I found the book repetitive and boring. We were told many things over and over again. And the set up for the romance with the Reverand is nothing if not ridiculous. Not interested in reading any more of these for sure.
Great suit: I used the suit for my company's many functions. Children from the local Pre-school sang for the senior Residents at our retirement community and I sat for pictures with them, many of the children had a hard time sitting with Santa until they came to our community I loved the suit and plan to use for many more functions.
3% failure rate: My husband bought me a Tivo for Christmas and we loved it until it died six months later. Look carefully at the warranty info and be prepared for poor customer service.
What a horrible experience: I bought the Tivo system about a month ago. Unfortunately, they do not have the correct line up for my cable provider. Without the right guide, the machine worthless. I have talked with them over 20 times and all I get are broken promises. Providing the programming is what they are supposed to do, but they simply will not take the time to do their job. I am very unhappy.
Stay Away From Tivo!: I have had a Tivo for about two months. I will do my best not let my frustrations make my review to harsh. I hated Tivo. The video quality was poor, and it seems like they spent more time on graphics than on the actual working product. I was never told about the $10 service fee, plus that stupid dancing TV never suggested anything relevant to my viewing habits. How does giving Star Trek 3 thumbs up tell Big Brother Tivo that I like Spanish Soap operas? IF A COMPANY IS GOING TO MONITOR WHAT I WATCH AT LEAST DO IT ACURATLEY. Unfortunately I am outside my return period and am stuck with it, and I am addicted to the features of a PVR. So i bought a Replay. Now that is a well thought out product. BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD TIVO!
It tried to tell me what to watch: I am returning my TiVo after finding out about a few surprises. First the monthly fee. What? Second it records and tries to guess what I might like to watch. Ok , ummm I share a TV with three people, so who does it think is watching it anyway. I'm getting a ReplayTV. No monthly fees. It only records waht I want and it will give me six more hours of storage all for the same price. Plus I think the company has a straight-forward honest approach. Tivo is all glam with their bubbly TV guy everywhere.
Keen idea, but a big disappointment: Well, the promises for ultimate control over watching television were certainly alluring enough to make the purchase of this rather-strangely designed machine (why does the faceplate remind me of HAL in 2001?).Unfortunately, what I got was a lot more than I asked for: a monthly fee, artificial intelligence that 'watches' what I watch & attempts to make 'suggestions' based on the widely-varying viewing habits between myself and my flat-mate.The interface is rather posh - I just wish that they had put the time & the effort used to make the swanky interface with groovy colours into a user interface that wasn't so convoluted.Looks like I'm going to the ReplayTV camp...
I prefer Tivo to Replay TV: I bought a Tivo machine....and then returned it within 30 days when I heard about the Replay TV 2020 with a larger hard drive for the same price. I then bought a Replay TV unit and have since returned it in order to buy another Tivo machine. Replay TV was not a bad unit....but I am going back to Tivo as some of the Direct TV stations I received did not show up on the Replay TV guide & therefore could not be recorded. Replay TV also would not allow me to record Direct TV pay per views (Tivo did). Tivo also allows for slow motion playback which is surprisingly convenient. Finally, Tivo also has a better interface for choosing programs to record. Tivo would be perfect if it adopted Replay TV's quick skip feature (though fast forwarding is easy enough), got rid of the useless thumbs up thumbs down feature, and added the extra 6 gigs of hard drive storage to match the 2020 machine (though I never ran out of space).
Great product but....: I bought a Tivo about two months ago and it has changed the way I watch TV. I have only used the five VCRs in my house about two times since getting Tivo. It is great. My only complaints, are about the fixed pricing on the units and lack of new updates to the software. There is so much more this thing could do, the Phillips doesn't upgrade it to do anything more than it already does. I also want an affordable upgrade for it. 14 hours is not enough recording time and there isn't an upgrade path to a larger storage capacity. I have called several times to see about the upgrades and they keep telling me that there isn't one. I checked the RePlay web site and their users are really happy about the number of new features that they have for RePlay. You would think that Phillips would see this and add features to keep up.
TiVo vs ReplayTV: I just got a ReplayTV for my second television. (I already got a TiVo for my big screen--but I wanted a second digital recorder because you need one for each TV).I gotta say the ReplayTV is incredible. Is it as incredible as my TiVo? Well, yes. And I think I like it a tad more because Replay doesn't charge the monthly fee I pay with TiVo.Also, TiVo doesn't have the QuickSkip button that Replay has. This is the BEST for zipping through time outs, boring stuff and lousy commercials.I also find Replay's channel guide interface easier than TiVo. Replay's is like my cable channel guide-so it's easier to use. TiVo's is based on shows and is a little more confusing.I guess that at the end of the day, I LOVE THEM BOTH (how could I not love something that makes television totally fun and easy to record? ). But I love Replay a little more.My next goal is to get a WebTV system for my third (and last) TV.
Tivo will dramatically change how you use TV: Any Tivo is a huge improvement over regular television.This unit can easily be upgraded for more capacity. I added an additional 80 gig drive without a hitch.Pausing live television is great. I haven't used my VCR in over a year. Tapes are a joke in comparison.Easy onscreen menus guide the set up of recording preferences.The Season Pass feature will record every episode for you!
Ummmm.....amazing.: Fabulous use of technology. No longer do I sit and surf. Also combines effortlessly my cable inputs and my satellite imputs. No more switching between TV/Video in order to tune into cable or satellite. If I want cable channel 8, I just type 8. If I want Discovery Channel, I just type 278. Amazing!
Setup issues: When purchased, this recorder would not set up properly. Calls to TIVO took over an hour to get through. So far no luck getting it to work
Potato City.: My roommate bought this and now our living room has turned into potato city as everyday i come home from work there is plenty of good shows on that either we've recorded or Tivo thought we might like.It's more than a toy, it's a way of life. :)
Tivo's customer service is terrible!: My unit broke (displayed just snow) and I called Tivo to get a replacement. After walking me through a painfully long troubleshooting procedure, they said someone would get back to me in the next two days. I asked them to call my work number, as I wouldn't be at home during the day. 3 days later I had a message waiting for me at home. The next day I called them back from home. They walked me through the same painful guide and, again, told me they'd call me back. Again, 3 business days later, I got a call with a message. No one answered the number given for several days, and then the message said they had moved, and left no forwarding number. It's been 3 weeks, and still no Tivo....
TiVo customer service - what a joke: I bought TiVo from amazon.com, saving myself the sales tax. When I got it, I carefully read the instructions, finding out that you couldn't use it with a digital PBX phone system, but analog would be fine. When I hooked it up, it didn't connect. I called customer support MULTIPLE TIMES, but they never returned my call when they promised. At one time, I was on hold for 45 min. One representitive told me to send it back to amazon.com, when the unit WAS NOT DEFECTIVE. I had to buy another one, when it had the exact same problem, for a grand total of 2 TiVos. Another rep said to go to Radio Shack and buy a wireless phone jack, which didn't work either. They cost me more than they are worth. I ended up sending the other one back too. The unit is really well designed, but if I were going to buy one, I would wait until there are more competitiors. It's still to early to buy one.
A must for anyone who would take Christianity seriously: This book is a series of letters from Dietrich Bonhoeffer while imprisoned by the Nazis - letters that are second in beauty and power only to the life of the man who wrote them. While often they deal with mundane family matters, the letters contain some theological gems that ask and reflect on questions that are as pertinent today as in the 1940s. Letters and Papers from Prison is a must read for anyone who would take the idea of Christianity and the Christian life seriously in the twentieth century.
Excellent!: Dietrich Bonhoeffer clearly had a link with God. Many people may not agree completely with his theology, but as evidenced in his letters he clearly had an understanding from which most people can stand to learn. These letters are raw and real, profound and easily adaptable.
Dealing With Difficult Times: Letters and Papers from Prison is a most informative and thought provoking book. Bonhoeffer deals with ideas and thoughts that most of us have never thought about. Some of this very likely comes from his dealing with being in prison for a lengthy time. The book caused me to think about how to better deal with the difficult times of life--how to maintain courage, hope, and usefulness in the midst of such an experience in which Bonhoeffer found himself.
An Invaluable Book!!!: Although I am not a Christian, I am in awe of Bonhoeffer and of this book, a collection of notes he smuggled out of prison before being executed because of his failed assassination attempt on Hitler. I admire Bonhoeffer more than any human being because he was able to maintain his faith, despite living in times when that faith was challenged more than it had ever been. Bonhoeffer wrote that the world was more "godless" and thus closer to God than it had ever been before. Bonhoeffersaw the world at its worst and yet found affirmation and hope. He deserves to be read and to be remembered.
Horseman pass by: Bonhoeffer, it has to be said, was a man locked up in a prison. He may have been a visionary, a great leader, but he ended up in prison and had to cope with that. There is a drabness to his writing. It doesn't quite lift you up. It doesn't quite inspire you. Of course, it was his own choice. He didn't have to wage war with the Nazis. He didn't have to come back from America and put his head in the lion's mouth. He went back knowing what was in store for him. It's questionable whether he achieved anything after that. Posthumously? Possibly. But his writings from prison? There are better things out there unless you're a scholar or something like that.
Beautiful but snug.: This costume is as beautiful in person as it is online. My only suggestion is make sure to think about the size of your baby ahead of time. I bought the 3 month outfit because my son is 3 months old, but he is a bit bigger for his age. But, I thought 6 months would be too big! So, it would just be easier for customers to have the height and weight limits listed on the page. My son is 25 inches long and 15 pounds and it is snug on him. Hope that helps if you are trying to guess how big you will need your costume to be. Item shipped to me very quickly and I was very pleased with everything else! Great item!
Candy Is Dandy, Nancy is Grand: Candy Is Dandy is a great book! Kids who like Nancy Drew and/or mystery would find this book sweeet. Stand back! Candy and Nancy makes a great team! From a funny factory from sweet candy to little Nancy, Sherlock Holmes doesn't stand a chance!
It is "Addicting": Edge of your seat,page turing thriller. One of those can't put down books. Keep writting Christine we can't wait until the next book of the series to find out what happened to Laurel, and all the rest. Great reading, this new author is going to go places. Thumbs up Christine.....
This is my number favorite rap CD. BUY IT!: This isn't one of the newest Spice 1 cuts out there but it is the best by far. Take it from someone who has about every Spice 1 CD. Every cut on the disc is hotter than fish greese!
Some Mo' GANGSTA SH#T 4 that ASS!!!: Hell yes, like my homeboy philip sad, this album is for the real Westside gangstas and defenetly a classic!!! Spice 1 follows 187 He wrote with anotha TIGHT ASS album fo' sho'! Blackjack are doing most of the production and it's DA BOMB using a new and special Gangsta sh#t. Ant Banks does it to with he's hardcore beats and the whol thing just sounds great and bumpin'! check out songs like: "Face of a desprate man", "Strap on the side", "Jealous Got me strapped" (with 2Pac), "N#gga sings the blues", "Busta's can't see me" and "Give the G a gat" you can't be wrong with this awsom album... get it!!!
A classic Spice Release..His Best??: This album is a west coast classic and a must have for anyone who likes west coast rap.The albums starts off phenomenally! 40 blesses track 1, with his peculiar rap flow disregarding the rules and regulations to the normal slanguage. Spice 1 tells an emotional gangsta tale on track 2 "Face of a.." which he released a video for back in the day. Track 3, another video cut, "Strap on the Side" produced by Ant Banks is where the album really starts to surpass the others. A masterpiece, pristine beat, memorable lyrics. I still know most of it after all these years. Track 4 somehows continues where track 3 left off with a little help from Pac. "Jealous Got Me Strapped" is excellent. One of my favorite PAc verses of all time.The first four tracks make this album good enough to buy it. Ant Banks does several of the other beats on the album..Spice continues spittin about what he knows, gangsta ish! If you don't have this Spice release, you are missin outPeace
tight!: This the only spice 1 joint I got but after listening to it I got to get a couple other joints of his too.You can let the whole album ride all the way through,he got a nice flow and the album features 2pac Method Man E-40 and some great production too for real.This joint is definitley something to grab a hold of especially if you like dat hardcore ....
Doesn't compare to Doc Ford or Thorn: I teach writing for a living --literature, we call it. So what a shock when I picked up what I thought would be a pot-boiler by Randy Wayne White and was absolutely knocked cold by who, I think, is a genuinely brilliant writer. I've read all of White's books and they led me to other Florida writers: James. W. Hall, Carl Hiaasen and Mr. Shames. I have just finished Mangrove Squeeze and it is, frankly, far beneath the quality of the books by the aforementioned writers. It is trite, strained, predictible and just plain silly. Mr. Shames tries so hard to be a tough guy and it just doesn't ring true. He tries equally hard to be literate and literary. Same results. Sorry -- I seldom write 0 reviews but this guys is out of his league.
a story you don't want to end!!!!: as with virgin heat, shame's once again deliver's a bunch of offbeat key west characters and a story that you don't want to end. suki sperakis is a keeper. it was great to read another chapter in what is quickly becoming the 'bert the shirt' series. shame's is as adroit at 'floridian mysteries' as are carl hiassen and james w. hall. his book's are always fun and perfect for a day on smathers beach. laurence brings margaritaville and all it's kooky inhabitants to vibrant life!! can't wait for his next one!!!
True End of the World!: Countless books have been written about the end of the world, it's not a new concept. Back in the 1930's it was. What War of the Worlds did for the alien invasion concept, When Worlds Collide does for end of the world stories. Truely brillent novel! Too be sure there are some outdated ideas as one would expect for a novel written 80 years ago, but considering the scienctific understanding and what was the social nornal at the time it's very believable. The desription of space ship construction is almost NASA-like. Interesting Biblical references without being preachy which is not the norm today as well. There are few novels where the end of the world really means the end of the world like When Worlds Collide. Apocalyptic desrciptions of destruction in heart renching detail that have a very modern fell to it. Must read for serious science fiction fans...just remember, "no more lions."
It's also available in german: I read the two books as a child in german language; they are in the same categorie as Heinlein, Assimov and so on
read this as a child and would love to find a copy: I read this book in grade school and I would love for my children to be able to enjoy the thrill of reading and reading this book like I have.I have looked for a copy but can't afford what I do find (only copy I could find was in a rare book store in Ft. Worth). But I am in constant look out for this book. I fell in love with reading just by reading this book
really good hard science fiction: Better than, but close th the movie of the same name, alsohas the sequel book "After Worlds Collide".
Can Not Rate It... Never Have Received It: I placed this order for my child's high school class requirement. I ordered at the beginning of his class, which was 08-22-2011. It is 09-23-2011 now. I still have not received the order. Guess I cannot tell you how great the product is but everything else I would consider a FAIL! Hopefully, I will receive a refund.
Good.: The book is in good condition for a used book... very little damage or marks on and inside the book. I'm pleased.
Been there, heard it...: I own the magificent recording by Ian Bosteridge of Cantata 82. No doubt this record company was hoping to capitalize on the popularity of Bosteridge's disc or the discs of other countertenors who have already recorded these cantatas with greater sensitivity and success (Scholl, for example). Matthew White does not measure up to the current standard of countertenor and this disc disappoints. His voice lacks a variety of vocal colours and he pushes, almost muscles his way through some of the beautiful German laments with little awareness of the emotional power of this music. It does not help that he is supported by a thin and directionless chamber ensemble.
Very inspiring: I read this book shortly after my daughter's (also named Zoe) premature birth. The book was rather inspiring to me and helped through some of tribulation I was going through with my own daughter. After reading the book, I knew that I was not the only one going through that same situation. After reading this book, I have felt even more blessed to have my child because I know that there are many parents out there who are not as fortunate as I am to have a healthy child.
A casualty of the information age: I assume that when this book was written (1969), publishing standards in gambling theory were lower. Computers were not available to do "brute force" calculations, so no in-depth statistical analyses were expected. Gambling wasn't so mainstream as it is today, and certain myths had not been dispelled. So while I cringe at the statement "Finally, keep in mind that in all games of chance the 'feel' of the dice must be considered," I give the authors credit for at least cataloging a list of canonical opening moves. Unfortunately, they have been viciously upstaged by Wikipedia.
Fascinating video for fans of Di Stefano: Giuseppe Di Stefano was destined for a cinema career, but the studio he was engaged for burned down. In the end his film appearances were limited to this one film, made when he was already famous in the opera house. It is the last film of the tenor matinee idol genre (Gigli, Schipa, McCormack etc.) and has a very thin, absurd, and confusing plot including an Italian Sherlock Holmes. Di Stefano really appears as himself, in his own clothes and personality. The film is valuable for the three or four popular songs Di Stefano sings in his own inimitable caressing manner, when he was in his very best voice, songs not available in audio recording format.
Great Book, well structured: This is a great book. The chapters are interesting and focused on topics that are immediately applicable for new writers. Lots of literary examples are included, along with analysis questions designed to help the reader learn from them. I would definitely recommend it.
A great text book for English students.: Perrine's story and structure is a great text book for English students and great for those studying literature. Highly recommended!
The Lute Player: When I was a child my aunts and grandmothers loaned this book around in the family and everyone loved it. As an adult I found it, and a box full of other books by Norah Lofts, at a second hand book store. This book is brilliant, as are all of Norah Lofts' books; she is my favorite author. I am shocked at how many are out of print. Other great books: Jassy, Nethergate, Queens of England, Scent of Cloves, The Lost Queen,How Far To Bethleham...they are all great. Please put them back into print.
Tedious: These was the most tedious book I have ever read. I am usually able to finish any size book within a one week period (and that's a really really big book! Usually its 4 days), this book is taking 2 weeks so far because I am so bored with reading it and I don't even look forward to picking it up after my son goes to bed at night, I actually dread reading it.I purchased 3 other Nora Loft books with this one and all I can say is that I hope the other two are much better!
Lute?: Sorry. I haven't read the book. One quick glance at it and I lost interest, the reason being that during Richard's time the lute was in its infancy. Very few people, if indeed anyone at all, were playing the lute (more probably some kind of oud). Kings certainly didn't keep lutenenist in that area at that time; court musicians were playing either harp, vielle or maybe citole. Call me an elitist or snob, but I have touble dealing with obvious historical inaccuracies. It robs the story of its verisimilitide and hence, for me, its appeal.
Heart Wrenching: Although I have been a fan of James Gandolfini and John Travolta for many years, this is a worthy film but hard to watch because of the fact I am a father and I have kids. Violent crime is never an easy subject but when it turns heartless, it surfaces human emotions that are hard to shed for awhile. This film was very well done and all the actors were top notch but as I indicated, the subject matter is disturbing. Just when you think people couldnt be sicker, somebody always tops the list with something else. This film will have you dealing with raw emotions and the fight over eye for an eye. Again, great film but be prepared to deal with the feelings it will surface in your spirit.
It don't get any better than this!: James and John put on a heck of a performance in this movie. They all did. But these two are at their best. The guy who cast them together is a genius. It's been awhile since I've been so moved by a movie, as Lonely Hearts did. I've purchased three so far and just pass them on to friends. It's that good. See for yourself...
I'm glad it was a rental: Why are there so many decent names in this movie? Don't let the casting fool you. Two stars because I watched it all the way through.The movie just drags along. It's a crime drama that takes place 50's. The premise isn't all that bad, but the story/plot and execution thereof sure are.Don't waste your time or your money and if you really want to watch it, certainly, what ever you do don't buy it.
Mayhem and tedium overwhelm art.: Thirty minutes into the film, we started skipping chapters. Then we ejected the disc and watched a documentary about intelligent design.
Watch "The Honeymoon Killers" instead!!!: Like DePalma's crapola royale "Black Dahlia", LH suffers from too much gloss and not enough story. Every minute I spent with this tripe made me appreciate "The Honeymoon Killers" that much more.
Bad All Around: This movie had great potential, but was lost by bad acting by John Travolta. He was wooden, stiff and his fake hair piece was so lame. The editing was bad, too. All the other actors did o.k.
Global Warming for the uneducated: I think books like this are dangerous and to those who insist we ignore global warming problems I just want to ask you to answer this one question: What if we continue to ignore this crisis and you are wrong. What then ???? If we do indeed choose to continue to ignore these issues and you happen to be wrong then it will be too late to do anything about them. As a result we all need to do our part and play the safe side which is to assume there is a big global warming problem and do what we can to protect the environment at any cost as we only have one environment people and noone should have the power to dictate that we ignore this crisis.
Old and dated,isn't consistant with author's own currents beliefs: Facts and science on this topic are moving and advancing so fast Please don't read old books to learn about Global warming!!!Words from the same author 3 years later in 2005. Quote:["People who have doubted predictions of catastrophic global warming (and that includes me) have long cited the satellite data series derived by climatologists John Christy and Roy Spencer at the University of Alabama Huntsville (UAH). That data set showed a positive trend of 0.088 degrees centigrade per decade until recently. On a straight line extrapolation that trend implied warming of less than 1.0 degree centigrade by 2100."]
Five stars for Nuvere from USA: Nuvere from USA is so hilariously typical of the entire radical enviro movement. Don't like the facts? Ignore them and make up your own! Oxygen is deadly to humans? CO2 is deadly to plants? Brilliant! You must have learned that from the high school kid you referred to. Better go back and get your G.E.D. Nuvere.I haven't read this yet but soon will.
Straight from ExxonMobile: You really only need to look at the author's affiliation to gain insight into this book. ExxonMobile (among other energy companies and Big Tobacco) fund the Competitive Enterprise Institute. With this information in mind you view this work with strict skepticism.
Junk Science? Read this book.: As a climatologist, i was quite intrested to read this book. After finising it, i was quite dissapointed. The author misrepresents science in every page. HE takes a complicated issue, and confuses the lay-man with his jargon. IT is a pity such intellectually dishonest books are allowed to be written.
Scaring us by pretending to scare us.: I love the entire Global Warming "Hoax" movement. It only shows the arrogance of those bankroling it and the ignorance the people who swallow it. The science behind human induced climate change is well documented. This is simple more trash to support a political and business ideology to kill the truth.
Someone needs a fact checker: You don't have to go much further than the jacket of this "myth" busting manifesto to know that the authors must have had other agendas when they wrote it. The first mind boggling bullet point states that,"Myth: Solar- and wind-powered generators are a renewable, efficient, and less intrusive alternative to gas-, oil-, and coal-burning generators.Fact: Global fossil fuel supplies are in no near-term danger of being depleted, and a single 555-megawatt natural gas power plant produces more electricity than 13,000 windmills"That actual fact is that commercial wind turbines today produce between 1.5 and 3 megawatts each. You don't need 13,000 windmills, you only need around 300. It's rather easy to go to GE's Wind Energy website and find this out. One is forced to conclude that If the authors can't get their first fact anywhere close to reality, why would you trust the contents inside?
Hopelessly biased: The Competitive Enterprise Institute exists to serve the interests of business. Their mission is to make money, and the more the merrier, and to hell with the consequences for the future. Scientists exist to serve the cause of objective truth. Yes, there are bad scientists, but the vast majority of scientists are now unanimous in saying that global warming is caused by human activities and will have dire results. I believe the scientists. And I can perceive global warming happening with my own senses.
Another "Scientist" Bankrolled by the Oil Companies: Stating that: "Fact: Antarctica has been cooling - and its glaciers thickening - for the past 30 years" is so totally ridiculous that I won't even waste my time to go into details of this sudo-scientific work of fiction.
actual cited scientific data shows this book is unbased: scientific peer reviewed journals show that the data preasented in this book is entirly un scientifically based. convection currents that power ocean circulation are slowing because the warming of the top two meaters of the oceans is causing a thermocline that does not allow mixing of cool dense lower water with warm upper strata. this is why it is climate change and not warming the oceans cannot continue to transfer heat to the upper latitudes causing cooling and warming at lower latitudes. despite this, without ocean circulation the phytoplanktin in the ocean cannot survive because oxygen would not cycle in and therefore they could not fix C02 from the atmosphere. this leads to a positive feedback cycle further increasing C02 in the atmosphere. other readings that I would recomend include any articles in truly peer reviewed journals where science is respected.
The Ostrich Strategy: The name of the publisher of this book "Competetive Enterprise Institute" tells you pretty much all you need to know about the agenda behind this book. It's nothing more than a collection of weak attempts by corporate sponsored researchers to discredit environmental issues that the energy, logging, and agricultural industries feel threatened by.The theme of this book can be summarized as: "Don't pay any attention to the environment. Trust Corporate America and everything will be OK."For those who already agree with the radical anti-environmental agenda of this group, this book will reinforce their views. For everyone else, it's a waste of time.
This Book is Total Nonsense: I highly recommend this book to anybody who wishes to continue to ignore the pollution and destruction of our environment and not feel any guilt. The basic message of the author is: continue to be greedy consumers blindly led by American Corporations. There are huge flaws in Bailey's argument and logic. It is especially sad to me that this book is the bestseller in the environmental section: it just emphasizes the greed of Americans.
Bailey has something to gain: I would recommend that before you read this book, remember that those environmentalists don't have anything to gain from protecting the planet and its inhabitants. "Competitive Enterprise", however, has a great deal to profit from undermining the "few" regulations conscientious scientists have fought for. Baily's claim that environmentalists are trying to scare us to death is pathetic. What's more pathetic is that people believe what they hear and read without questioning motives, profits, sponsors, endorsements...
Debunked: This book is part of the shameless misinformation funded by big oil (Exxon in particular) and debumked years ago by mainstream science.
Radicals!: Hmmm...A panel of UN scientists has already warned low-lying nations about the dangers of global warming. Even the Bush Administration mentioned it this year -- a first for the executive branch.UN and George Bush fear mongering radicals?Only if you also believe in black helicopters.
based on an agenda, not science: Bailey's credentials are as flimsy as the facts behind this ridiculous volume.Anyone who thinks improving the environment for future generations is a political issue deserves to waste money on this book.
Great cookie cutter: I used this cookie cutter for a baby shower, and everyone thought the cookies were adorable. Hold it securely when cutting shapes from dough, as it is not as strong as copper cookie cutters. But, it still works beautifully and makes HUGE cookies.
Looks can be deceiving: While I love the look of this baby carriage, I was very disappointed in it's size. It would be helpful to list the dimensions. I ended up ordering a larger one from a different company which was perfect.
Baby Carriage Metal Cookie Cutter: I purchased this to make cookies for my daughter's baby shower. They made a good sized cookie and the guests really liked them. So much better that the usual cake.
An incredibly BEAUTIFUL book!!!!!!!!: This is a book that every young adult and adults should have on their coffee table!!! Never before seen pictures and told through the eyes of a child through the civil rights movement this book is a refreshing, new insight that is a fast paced read!! A book to revist again and again!!!!!
Extremely Powerful !!!: These images are worth more than 1 million words. They speak the truth with clarity that is rarely achieved in a discourse about race in America. This is American history in its true form. A great editing job and choice of photos.THIS IS A CLASSIC HISTORY LESSON
Three-for-one, can't beat that: Having three separate diameters is nice. Diameter determines the focal length and field of view. So depending on how close you hold the lens to the object determines how much of it will be seen at one time. Having a selection makes it more comfortable to view items depending on how much detail you need to see.
Disappointment: The book starts with interestinig beginning plot lines; butafter the death of a possible central figure the main character'sstory begins to unravel, lose its focus and wander about until itbegins to sound like a fictional nervous breakdown.
Waste of time!: Maybe I was in a different state of mind when I read this book, but I absolutely hated it. I have never found a book to be so unconvincing and painfully lacking real emotion. The book starts off well enough with Bean adjusting to a new life in Alaska, but it suddenly downward spirals and we're left to believe that Bean has meaningful relationships and a dignifying rebound from a tragedy. Her relationship with Jimmy bothered me more than anything -- apparently he was her best friend, yet at one of the most important parts, the author skims right over him and only provides a brief outline of Bean's emotions. I would have quit halfway through, but since I heard so many positive reviews, I thought the end might be redeeming. Again, I was wrong. The book got worse as I went along and by the end I was thrilled to be freed from reading this dull book.
The godly, the bad and the ugly: A good book about people fighting for the right and defending the weak. I like the growth the characters are going through. The friendship of the main characters is well written.
Excellent: This book is excellent. It is an exceptional read; this book is historically connected to not just Dr. Dubois but understood and written as a benchmark for urban studies! A must read for all who want to engage African Americans in America or urban studies post the 20th Century.
I can't believe that......: this is up on Amazon. I also can't believe that I'm the first to review this. Here goes.One review that I read labled this a 'coffee shop' CD, and I can see what they mean. To truly appreciate this CD, I would recommend sticking this on your Ipod, Mini disc, or CD player, get a copy of the Album guide(availble on www.Lampmode.com)a cup of tea/coffee, and listen. The album guide explains what shai wanted to achieve with each track, and how this is backed up by the word of God. This really helped me, as on first listen, I was not duly impressed. But having listened to this in my ipod, for over a week, thus far this is my CD of the year. Fav cuts: Title track, Intro and Outro, Heart first(remix) My portion, Mic check..... I love them all. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
Seriously?! This is insane!: I cannot believe this guy! I just found him based on Amazon Recommendations....The lyrics are legit and glorifying our Christ and the music - most fabulous hip hop. Pull up through this drive through and order yourself a Triple McMeat Burger because he is bringing the solid food - no milk here! Wow... just blown away!
Don't waste your money: This sprinkler is a piece of junk. My son received it for his 5th birhtday and couldn't wait to use it. More water sprays out of the bottom than the top completely making my lawn a mud puddle. I just took it off and hooked up our regular sprinkler. Way more fun!
Cool Water toy!: My 3 year old loves it! The water spray is not forceful which makes it real easy for the younger kids to enjoy. Will cool off a warm day.
Horrible purchase: This was a cute product, but worked horribly. The child played with it one time, and it was quickly forgotten. Would never purchase again.
Larry: I was disappointed in this book. It doesn't really address the elements of writing that I had hoped that it would based on the title.
Hummingbirds: These are pretty and all but you cant clean them. The bottle brush wont fit and you cant get to where its dirty.
Really pretty: Simple to use and looks great! The hummingbirds like the feeder and it is easy for them to stand on the side. Really pretty!
Excellent!: I've had this feeder for well over a year and the hummingbirds love it! It doesn't leak or attract bees or ants. It's very easy to clean and fill, and looks beautiful hanging on my patio. I highly recommend it!
Great Movie: I saw it on Amazon for the 3rd time. It streamed well and it was great quality. I really enjoyed the movie.
Interesting: The movie was ok. I wouldn't see it again. I did not like the ending at all. Goodl luck, too.
Worldly and Depressing: Movies are supposed to move you. However, Beyond Borders did not do that at all. It was like watching the evening news with a little romance added in. The romantic resonance that centered around Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen's characters appeared detached and incomplete as a result of the conflicting plotlines. There was too much going on, and it looked like the filmmakers were trying to make two films in one. If the movie was attempting to be another English Patient, but with late twentieth to twenty-first century issues, it failed.The most memorable aspect of the film was the attempt at presenting issues that have occurred or are occurring within the eastern borders both in the pacific and the baltic or in between. It had been unfortunate that the climax of the film ended with the loss of one of the major characters. However, it leaves you thinking why one of the lovers survived. There's no happy ending here.
TRASH & GARBAGE!!!!!!!: Too much cursing, profanity, adultery, and fornication! Need I say more... Angelina Jolie is a married woman who goes off to another country and has a secret love affair while her husband and child think she's off on some humanitarian trip. I hesitated when I saw her on the cover because she tends to flaunt her adulterous and bi-sexaul behavior. I got it because I like Clive Owen and I like movies filmed in Africa. It's not a family movie because they swear and curse a lot and has too much killing. I think it would have turned out better without the bad language and without the adultery and fornication.
Absolute Crap, selfish & self-aggrandising annoying Jolie: A total waste of time! How did Clive Owen get into this? I love him and watched it because of him and because of a story that initially sunded interesting!!So Ms Jolie basically is a hero in all the country's where she happened to adopted children from. And of course she easily survives Chechnya ...It is a VERY VERY cheap movie, very poor story!!!
Crapfest: Quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time. Clive Owen is really cool, but not in this movie. Angelina Jolie's polital agenda totally fueled this film. What a waste of time.
Beyond borders used dvd: I would suggest purchasing from them. The dvd arrived quite quickly and since it is one of my favorite movies, I was quite happy to see the shape it arrived in. Can't ask for better service.
A very moving picture.: Before I say my praises, I will advise for anyone who enjoys not having their movie spoiled, not to read a review by BANANAGURL, who totally spoils it by giving away the ending!Anyways, I found this to be more of a heart moving, touching movie, than a love story with a war/refugee backdrop. It made me realise and appreciate all that I have in my life. The warmth, safety, food and cleanliess, that 50 million people, such as those portrayed in the movie lack.This wasnt a boring, draggin-on movie, but a moving drama, that really shows the raw and deep pain of human suffering that goes on, out of peoples minds and awarenss. Hunger and pain, spreads through those people like a great colossos of doom. Great perforamnce from Angelina, and Cliwe. I'm very glad I got a chance to experience this visually moving project.
A lot better than I expected: I was expecting the worst when it came to this movie. I am a fan of Angelina Jolie, but it didn't do very well at the box office and I didn't really hear anything about it.Well, none of that matters because this is a very good movie. Angelina does a good job here, as does Clive Owen, her love interest. The story was interesting and eye-opening. It kept my attention even though this isn't a lightning-paced movie. I wanted to know what would happen to Angelina's character. I was also surprised by a few twists that happen unexpectedly. There's a key scene midway through the movie that doesn't mean a lot at the time, but perfectly foreshadows something that happens later on.I highly recommend this movie. It was very entertaining and it really did make you think. I'm not a big fan of movies like this, but this is an exception. It should have been a bigger hit.
Please enter a title for your review: A story that has particular relevence to real people in the real world makes it's leading man such a fake action hero and expects his attitude to not detract from the realism of the situations and even expects you to like him. Whatever romance is supposed to be seen in the mutual martyrdom of the couple is hard to find given the two do not appear to have made each other happy even for a second of the film's duration and even when the dude makes his declaration of love speech he expresses no warmth. It also seems like the kind of movie that's gone through so many rewrites and re-edits than even the people working on it have no idea what it's supposed to be anymore.
A Tale In Two Minds: The border in this film which is beyond belief is that of credibilty. The drama's tone is disturbingly melodramatic with the Relief Doctor's appearance at a high society fund-raising ball in London. We can accept this though, given the painful urgency of his message. But when Jolie quits her poor husband to Ethiopia in pursuit of responding to well-intended empathy for the war and famine stricken camps, the balance of the film gets crazily out of whack, and never recovers. It's not to say that romantic love has no place in such dire life circumstances. More, the film makes this point above the far more expressive needs of the people who the aid workers are there to service. Quite addled really, and undrermining all other high-minded and serious utterances made by the lead actors. In Ethiopa, in particular, this seemed in errant taste. The conceptual work is at the root of this.
Well-Intentioned, But Hardly Convincing: "Beyond Borders" was originally to be directed by Oliver Stone, and to star Kevin Costner and Cathrine Zeta Jones. Keep that in mind before you watch it. The completed film by Martin Campbell starring Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen retains one of the initial intentions of the film -- namely, love romance. ..Don't say the film opens your eyes. Write down the synopsis of the film, and see the impossible thing that the film requires us to believe. .. "Beyond Borders" is laudable in depicting them, yes, ... I sincerely hope that it does not symbolize what happened to the career of Angelina Jolie. (And "Beyond Borders" never even reached #10 of box ofice chart in America. What does that mean?)I know the film is a well-intentioned attempt to show the misery of these people, but if you really want to see the authentic accounts of refugees' lives, see Michael Winterbottom's "In This World." That is more realistic and shocking, too.
good premise, a great Clive Owen but why the love story?: It's hard to pass up a movie when it's about trying to save starving and dying people in other countries and when the person is played with such a strong presence from Clive Owen (King Arthur, Closer and Gosford Park), you know its gonna be a good movie but putting a love story between him and a miscast Angelina Jolie (Shark Tale, Hackers and Taking Lives)...it doesn't add up. Also starring Teri Polo (Meet The Parents, Meet The Fockers and Domestic Disturbance), Linus Roache (Hart's War, Wings Of The Dove and The Forgotten) and Noah Emmerich (Monument Ave., Miracle and Cellular). Yeah, so, good premise sqandered by love story with miscast Jolie but Owen still holds his own in a strong performance.
Wonderful: This is a movie that really makes you think about our world today. It is an amazing story. The actors do a great job portraying these difficult roles also. The movie shows what is really going on in these third world countries. Sometimes me live so blindfolded, we do not consider others not nearly as fortunate as we are. This movie should be shown to all those who do not fully appreciate how great their lives are, and to not take things for granted. This is an absoultly outstanding movie and I strongly recommand it to all.
Too much cussing: If this movie didn't have so much cussing, it would be better. The actual plot is good, and given the number of hotspots in the world today, it is a perpetually timely story. I would have to say that it was a very sad movie, but one which is necessary to give us a glimpse of the horrors of life for many people in war-torn countries. Angelina and Clive were certainly passionate about their roles, which made this film believable.
For my specially "chosen" child!: This was a Christmas gift to one of my adopted twins to let her know just how special she was to me. I placed an inscription on the inside front cover and I think it will be a keepsake she'll keep forever. The book came quickly, as promised, and was in excellent condidition.
Why I Chose You Review: The book Why I Chose You was a disappointment for me. It's just okay. I expected some short adoption stories. Instead the book just lists simple sentences that express reasons for adopting along with an accompanying photo of an adopted child and his family. The book lacks substance. I don't recommend it.
Relaxing: These chimes have beautiful tone and rings to them. The bigger the better. Only reason I gave 4 star was for the lack of a nicer hanging mechanism. Instead of having a solid metal ring or hook for hanging, it's just the end of the rope itself pressure squeezed by a aluminum piece. And that small aluminum piece holds the entire weight of the chime.It's holding so far but I would have preferred something more secure and solid. That method of terminating the ropes also makes it not quite even when hanged.BUT IT SOUNDS GREAT!!! :-)
Highest Quality, Wonderful Windchimes: i love windchimes, but very specific types. I like rich tones, not the high pitched ones that annoy neighbors. I had my eye on this brand of windchimes for a while now. I convinced myself to spend the money. They are WELL WORTH the money. This is a high quality product, but at this price they are still a very good value. The rich tones resonate nicely to create a melody of nature. I would not hesitate to recommend these chimes. This specific one is very good and I think that any of the choices in this brand would probably be great.I have some $25 chimes from Home Depot and these don't even compare. They are wonderful and relaxing.
The Garnet Earrings: The stones were smaller than appeared in the picture of them. Otherwise they are very nice.
Good information, but monotone: As a French teacher, I bought this to supplement some of the descriptions of Versailles in our high school textbook. It is quite informative, IF you can stay awake during it. The narration is monotone and I watched as my usually attentive class fell asleep. It does have moments that elicited some reactions and raised some heads ("nobles would find dark corners and staircases in which to relieve themselves as toilets were scarce" or "servants would scratch at the door with a pinky finger rather than knock"). These little tidbits were things that they remembered and referred back to over the year, but as to the main ideas of the documentary, those were mostly lost amidst the snores.
Jungle Fever Meets the Pink Triangle: For its time, this book may have been revolutionary. However, when so many great books have been written by/on black gay men (Brother to Brother, One More River to Cross, Vanishing Rooms, etc.), there is little need to read this book now. This book allows white men to speak more than blacks do. Relatives of Smith's black lovers say he exploited his mates. Why did Langston Hughes' estate allow his work to be published here but not spoken in Isaac Julien's "Looking for Langston"? Don't let the new cool cover fool you. There's better stuff out there, even interracial stuff.
A little sizzle, but no steak: Like those jerks who go mountain climbing before a snowstorm, this author went exploring in Burma in 1950 despite everyone's warnings. Hitching rides on broken down trucks, sleeping on bug infested floors, boarding trains that were expected to break down or be attacked, he somehow survived to tell about it. Some of his descriptions were well written, but I came away knowing more about his bad choices than about Burma. My time would have been better spent watching "Lonely Planet."'
LikeTrack 5 This is A "Nightmare": There are too many quality dance cds on the market. It is no wonder that this cd is ranked around 285,000. I recommend the Pure Disco Series or Disco Nights Series. Those cds will provide more bang for your buck.
Hockey puck: You can't see it in the pictures but this watch is something like 1/2 inch thick!That and the fact that is has a weak strap and this watch found it's way to the trash can in 3 months.My two-year old son missed the the beeping the buttons produced but I was happy to be rid of this albatros!
great purchase: We bought this as a replacement for a gate my 4 year old couldn't open and close- the baby (11 months) kept getting out and even fell down the stairs once. Whew, this one is so much better! It looks much nicer and feels tons sturdier than the plastic ones and is not too hard for my 4 year old to open. She's happy, we're happy, the baby is happy (unless we're on the opposite side) :) We were able to mount it on the bannister on both sides. We just put a decorative molding on one side to attach the latch to. Only complaint is the supports that hold the hinges to the wall/bannister/whatever are plastic and I'm afraid they might not hold up- our 4 year old likes to hang on the gate and swing, which hopefully will stop soon. One of the consumer pictures I saw showed a different latch than what we have, so be careful.
bought 2 of these, and both broke within 3 months!: I have a daycare in my home and bought 2 of these gates to cover both stairways. Within 3 months, both were broken beyond repair. The metal is great, but the plastic peices that hold the metal to the wall are WEAK and broke on me TWICE! Once was when a parent pulled the gate closed- apparently too hard... the other was when my 20-month-old son tried to pull the gate open. Come on, he's a baby and exactly who these gates are designed for! He shouldn't be able to break it. Luckily he got scared and cried instead of taking a tumble down the stairs. Don't buy this gate!
Very unsafe gate: We bought this gate for the top of our stairs. The first thing that we noticed is that the hardware does not allow for any baseboards, so you have to raise it above them for installation. This leaves a gap of about 6" at the bottom. The screws that came with it are not good for drywall, so if you are installing it where there is no stud, you have a safety issue. The latch is a great big bolt that slides into a slot. Not only could the bolt injure your child, but it is not a secure lock. There is a piece of plastic that comes over the tip of the bolt holding it in place and you're supposed to have to push a button to release it. All you really have to do is push that plastic with your finger (we were stunned when our 12 month old daughter opened it)and the bolt (and gate) is released. We are planning on returning this ASAP and getting a safe gate. If you are concerned about the safety of your child and not just wanting the illusion of safety, buy another gate!!
Very happy with this product!: After much research into a gate for the top of our stairs, we chose this one and I'm thrilled! It looks great, doesn't have that "plastic" look that many do, it has very clean lines and blends nicely with our white banister. I was so concerned about a difficult opening mechanism as I have numerous friends who I have visited where it's virtually impossible to open the gate at the top of their stairs holding a baby. This one is so easy!!!! And simple...you really don't need to explain to anyone how to use it. It did require my husband to make a trip to the hardware store as he decided he wanted to add a piece of wood onto the sheetrock side since he didn't want to mount it directly into the sheetrock. But, in order to get something mounted very securely at the top of the stairs, you need to expect a little work. Overall I'm thrilled and recommend to others out there looking.
Safeway Gate-Great Gate: The Safeway Gate 30 1/2" by Kidco was a lifesaver for us. It was easily installed on the top of our steps, keeping our little one free from falling. The gate's adjustable extra width was just what we needed. It is easy to use and very sturdy. It's simple design makes it blend in very well. We highly recommend it.
Great Gate: Easy to install when no other gate would work. No wonder Consumer Reports rated it the best for use at the top of stairs. It's simple to open and gives me a secure feeling knowing that my child can't begin to figure out how to open it.
Great Gate!: We purchased this gate when my son was 10 months old and climbing like a pro. We installed one at the top of our stairs and one at the bottom, in our living room. Not only is the gate simple in style (not an eyesore in our main living area), but it was easy to open and close with one hand. The sturdy construction of this gate assured me that my climber would be safe and unable to scale to the other side. Three years later and we just reinstalled the gates for child number 2, who is determined to outdo her brother's climbing abilities! Purchasing these gates was one of the best investments we made!
Don't waste your time with this one: I read all the great reviews on this gate before deciding which to purchase. I wanted a sturdy, nice-looking swing gate for the top of our stairs. After about an hour and a half the gate is installed only to find that I don't like it at all. The gate looks very nice but the latching mechanism is horrible in my opinion. It is very difficult to get open and closed especially when carrying a baby. This one is going back today and I will opt for The First Years Simple and Secure Stair gate. I hope it opens easier!
WARNING!!! Do not buy this gate!: I purchased this gate to use at the top of my stairs. Shortly after starting to use it, I became aware of a major problem. The gate has to be lifted up slightly in order to lift the bolt on the gate up and into the latching mechanism. The problem is that if you lift up too much on the gate (and it doesn't take a lot), the pins on the gate come right out of the hinges mounted to the wall and you're left holding onto the detached gate. Last week my 18 month old daughter went to close the gate. She lifted up too hard on the gate, lifted it out of the hinges, and my daughter and the gate fell down the stairs!!!! And this is supposed to be a SAFETY gate! I am extremely upset about this. Fortunately, my daughter was not hurt, only very scared. But she could have been hurt badly.
Not good at all: We bought two gates, to see which worked better on installation, and this was the loser by FAR. The instructions were less clear than the other brand, and the installation guide measurements were off! I had to dig out my drywall anchors and re-drill. The latch is difficult to use, and almost impossible to achieve one-handed. It's unsafe, as when it swings open, the disc-shaped latch it right at toddler eye-height. I would not recommend this gate to anyone. Look for the one that has a push-turn latch instead. It seems much more secure & is a lot easier to use.
WARNING!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!: -5 STARS!!!I CANNOT WARN YOU ENOUGH ABOUT NOT BUYING THIS GATE!!!!! IT IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE GATES ON THE MARKET. THE INSTRUCTIONS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO INSTALL. THE GATE WILL NOT OPEN AND CLOSE SMOOTHLY- OR EVEN WITH ONE HAND. THE SPRING PIECE ON THE HINGE COMES FLYING OFF PERIODICALLY WHEN YOU TRY TO OPEN IT.ONLY BUY THIS GATE IF YOU WANT TO SPEND FOREVER ON INSTALLATION ONLY TO BE LEFT WITH GAPING HOLES IN YOUR WALL!!!!!!!
Doesn't Serve It's Purpose: I had to mount this gate against the wall and the banister. The screws included are not for drywall at all. Also, the gate has to be lifted up high so that you can secure it to the top square of the banister. This leaves such a large space under the gate that it doesn't make any sense to have it.
DON'T BUY THIS GATE ...IT CUT MY SONS HEAD: My 15 month old was walking around the gate with my mom to go down the stairs and the bolt part of the locking mechanism cut and bruised his forehead. The locking mechanism consists of two bolts that screw into the top and bottom of the gate...then snap into plastic pieces(one on top and the other on bottom) that are fixed to the wall. Shame on this company for manufacturing someting so dangerous. I notified the company and they made me feel as if it were entirely my fault. They are going to refund my money, however, I don't want to see this happen to anyone else, especially a small child.
Don't buy this gate!: It took over an hour for my husband to install this gate. As soon as I tried it out, I made him take it back down. It was very difficult to open and close, and since we're using it at the top of the stairs, it was not acceptable. It can best be described as "difficult to use, loud, and clunky". We purchased the Simple and Secure gate by the First Years the next day, and we LOVE it. It is the complete opposite of the Safeway gate.
SOMETIMES IT PAYS TO SHOP AROUND....: WE NEEDED SAFETY GATES FOR OUR NEW HOME...MY WIFE PURCHASED 5 OF THESE GATES FROM BABY'S R US FOR 64.99.....CONSUMER REPORTS #1 RATED SAFETY GATE....A FEW DAYS LATER WE WENT TO IKEA AND FOUND THE SAME EXACT GATE WAS 19.99...IKEA CALLS THEM PATRULL FAST....THE SAME EXACT GATE FOR ONE THIRD THE PRICE....
Terrible Instructions: I'm going to disagree with thsoe below who found this easy to install. I am fairly handy but I found the instructions and engineering absolutely appalling. Don't know if any other brands are better but if you are a busy parent who doesn't need another project, look elserwhere.Once up it works. It's just a gate. It should. It's not the space shuttle.
This gate is a piece of junk.: This gate deserves zero stars. This is a very heavy iron gate, which is good - the problem is that the hinges & other hardware supplied by the mfgr are totally inadequate to attach the gate securely to the wall. I have two in my house (I live in a three story home). The hinges are just plastic and one set broke upon installation. Also, both gates have come out of the wall twice. My sheetrock cracked when I tried to put one of the gates back up. Do yourself a favor, don't buy it.
Good, but room for improvements: ... would like to add to this a few 0 comments... Be aware that this gate uses bolt with a washer welded to the end of it, the height of this feature is right at that of eye level for a child, thus could result in a major accident.The Manufacturer gives no option for retention to contain the gate in an open state. I have added a Velcro strap similar to that found to contain cords... the problem is that this keeps sliding down to the floor and is a pain ... to use. I have also added a felt bumper on my rail to keep the gate from damaging the woodwork.I still think this gate is one of the best, but has an area to improve on...
Another version of Lucan: If I had known it was another translation of Lucan, I would not have ordered it, BUT I would have made a mistake. This work has a better translation for the modern reader, and lots of good supporting information. Some of the comparisons I made with other versions make me wish I had this ten years ago. The notes are worth the price of the book!
Underrated Historical Epic: An underrated work of the Silver Age. There are some excellent epsiodes that could stand on their own as mini-epics: the suicides of Vulteius and comrades, Appius 'rape' of the Pythia, Caesar's journey by sea, Scaeva's aristeia, Erictho's necromancy, and Cato's journey through Africa to name just a few. The historical insights into the lives of Caesar, Pompey, and Cato are also especially enlightening. Absolutely worth a first and second look!
WOW!!! GREAT TV PRICE AND PICTURE: I spent about two weeks looking for a projection TV from other retailers and Target had the best one. I got the TV on 2/3 and the picture is unreal. It is so clear I got it hooked up to my reciever and what a blast! The picture is better then the ones that were more expensive. I am very happy with the Daewoo TV and will stay with this brand name.
STAY AWAY...FAR, FAR AWAY: I bought this TV Jan 2, 2006 - it took 3 weeks to arrive, worked for 4 days, then died. Daewoo sent a technician over, which took another week. He told me it was a bad motherboard, that it would take a week to order (goodbye superbowl party). A week came and went, and he told me Daewoo didn't have the motherboard in stock and wouldn't give him a time frame for delivery of a replacement. Long story short, I had to fight to return it and to this day 2 months later still haven't been able to - I have a 5-foot paperweight in my living room.DAEWOO is HORRIBLE. Stay away from these incompetents.
A joy! Open yourself up to the world around you!: A fantastic book written by Nobel prize winner Niko Tinbergen. I recommend this book for adults and advanced children alike. I read this when I was in 6th grade and it was the book that lead me on my path to a career in neuroethology.Tinbergen opens us up to the natural world around us even to those of us who are city dwellers.Exposing us up to both the world of nature and the methodology of the naturalist he reveals something that the modern day world more and more distracts us from - patient observation and the results that it yields.I recommended this book to a close friend of mine who has two children, a two year old and kindergartner and he uses this book as a manuel in their nature hikes.I assure you you will not be disappointed if you purchase this book.
More fun than I thought!: I thought I would experiment with these and see if I liked them. It turned out I loved them, even more than I expected, so I can't recommend them highly enough!
Abstractions Heaped Upon Abstractions: Obtuse. The author writes in a style so verbosely obtuse that the poor reader must read each paragraph 10X or more to garner even the slightest grain of meaning. Deciphering the hidden meaning embedded in an entire page would require {in my humble opinion) years of dedicated study from the most erudite of minds---a task too arduous for my feeble brain.I have aged 30 years in the short span of a single week, trudging thru this impenetrable tome. Needless to say, I am not enamored with this book.
NOT BIG ENOUGH!!!!!!!!: Although this product might work if you had a really small child but with my son it is simply not big enough. It does catch alot of juice and food but so does the floor. It needs to be at least a 3X3 area and this one is just simply not big enough for my son.
Mess Off: This mat was great when my baby was learning to turn over.Later it was great to keep mess where it belonged: off my floor.It's easy to clean.Little enough to store,and will still be a great use for all those little crayon errors when my child learns to color.
Marketing Nonsense!: WHY IN THE WORLD DID I SPEND SO MUCH MONEY ON THIS? THIS STUPID MAT NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP JUST LIKE THE FLOOR!!! NOT ONLY DO I HAVE TO CLEAN IT, BUT THEN I HAVE TO PICK IT UP, FOLD IT NEATLY AND PUT IT AWAY JUST TO FEED MY KID IN ANOTHER HOUR?I WOULD MUCH RATHER CLEAN MY FLOOR AND WALK AWAY!
Definitely a necessity when baby starts feeding him/herself: This splat mat is nice and large to protect your floors. My 16 month old can throw food far enough to still get the floor dirty, but in general this mat catches most of the mess (and there's a lot of THAT with a toddler learning to feed herself). The major plus for this mat is that you can toss it into the washing machine. I'm planning to buy a few extra mats so we can just throw the dirty ones into the laundry. The mat also cleans up well with a sponge. It's also thin enough to take along on trips. The minus to the mat is that if you have a highchair with wheels often the mat wrinkles up if you are trying to move or turn the chair. I wish it had more "grip" on the bottom to hold it steady. Overall a good product, and definitely worth having.
another waste of money for parents who NEED everything: Why spend the money? Only neccessary if you are feeding over carpet. Vinyl floor wipes well. Go to the dollar store and spen a buck on a large vinyl tablecloth or shower curtain. Chose your color, size, style, etc. and only spend a buck. These are usually much bigger than the splat mats and work just as well. Can match your tablecloth or home decor if you wish. Just eye candy in the store, you really do not need everything they sell. Save the cash for important items.
Large in size, but somewhat thin: This has really saved our carpets and floors, but the material is somewhat thin and has a tendendcy to fold over and wrinkle up. This can cause a few minor tripping accidents if left that way.Overall it does what is claims, but it could be a little thicker material.
SAVE YOUR MONEY BUY A TABLE CLOTH: I recently purchased a splat mat for my 11 month old son. I brought it home and realized that it was much too small. Also, the material was very flimsy. Here's what I did. I returned the mat the very next day. Then I headed over to [another store] and purchased a circular vinyl table cloth. It only cost me [$] and it works great! It covers a larger area to protect my tile against the inevitable spills. It's heavier so it doesn't bunch up when my son's high chair gets moved around. Finally, I was able to find a pattern that went with the decor in my kitchen.
A glorified shower curtain.: I pulled this thing out of the package and just rolled my eyes- it's half a shower curtain with an ugly design on it! Save yourself the money. Go buy (as many others have suggested) a heavy duty vinyl shower curtain or tablecloth- not only will you save money, but you get to choose something other than the Miami Vice pastels!
Disappointing book by Carol O'Connell: This book does not come close to my other favorite CarolO'Connell books such as Killing Critics, The Man Who Cast Two Shadows. Very disappointed. Hope the next book is better.
Kindle Version: Love the story. BUT the editing was awful!! One of main characters was named 'Riker', we got "Piker" instead. Not so bad, easy to figure out. A question was asked and the answer was "Nof." These are just two of 15 to 20 errors. Very distracting from the story and the Kindle product.
The stone angel was porly written: This was a poor attempt at any kind of writting. I was upset that they used the same title as the great margaret lawarance. it made me quite upset. the book was overly poor and i was quite disappointed.
Religion Stereo Gone Mad: Read the Amazon reviews and got the impression this author would meet my expectations. I was wrong! Mallory is rarely found in the book until the outrageous/swashbuckling conclusion....her soulmate Charles is a hulking, love sick mess trying to solve the obvious crime(s) while hoping Mallory will finally make a commitment to him....you will not like Charles...a cross between the pigeon you loved to jostle around in the halls in high school and the duty blocking dummy on the jr. varsity football team. As far as character development....Agusta was your duty southern hick wrestling snakes and gators; the holy rollers were bonafide "Deliverance" brackish comedy; the sherif was love forelorn for Mallory's mom and seemed trained watching Boss Hog reruns...overall well written but may end up boiler plate script for a very very regional high school play....
Overly Contrived: I read Mallory's Oracle and, though I thought it was a disappointment in some minor ways, it was sufficiently well-written and spell-binding for me to hope future books would improve on the premise. Stone Angel, however, was a HUGE disappointment. I was so irritated by the time I got to the end that I didn't care who murdered whom.
great deal on a very good watch: I think they forgot they had this watch at amazon for the price I bought it because when I checked the shippers website it was about 150 more. Anyway this is a very good swiss made watch. The dial has a subtle texture to it and the bracelet is very comfortable. You can actually keep track of three time zones if you need to with the inner rotating bezel. My first Accutron purchase but not my last. Oh and the shipper got the watch to me quicker than estimated. Very happy with purchase.
Vile, evil, and succulent erotica: This is a book for very specialized tastes. The stories range from mild to extreme, but they are always interesting and will keep you yeaning to read more. This is a book I recomend very highly, mainly because I enjoyed it oh-so much =)Opium Poppy Fields
User-Friendly: I found this volume incredibly user-friendly, easy to read, and the layout well-organized. It focuses on the moon as well as the sun in formulating astrological relationships. I highly recommend it for those who wish to get their synastry feet wet.
Incredible Shrinking Man Vs. Disembodied Brain!: And the brain loses!Psychotic Colonel Barham is literally out of his head, as his brain is removed from his ailing body to be transplanted into a NASA space probe. While floating in a tank, the brain develops super-powers and starts programming people to kill anyone Barham doesn't like. Anyone who remembers the old chestnut "Donovan's Brain" can figure out what happens next, when handsome Grant ("The Incredible Shrinking Man") Williams starts getting along with Barham's - er, "widow"?You've seen it before, and seen it better. Second season producer Ben Brady talked OL's poor audience to death in the show's worst scripts - and this is one of the show's worst scripts.
Take my brain, please!: Oh man is this bad.For what it's worth, here's the plot;To land a ship on Mars you need one smart computer. Unfortunately, there are none around. Soon to be pushing up daisies Colonel Barham however, donates his brain to science and viola, we have a smart computer. Unfortunatly, his wife glances at Barham's friend for a nano-second and the brain goes bonkers.Gifted with super-human powers to annoy, the brain gets a god complex. And the general in charge of the project finally puts the audience at ease by putting a bullet through the brain. Everything explodes for some reason (encased in gasoline I suppose) and we fade to the credits.It would be hard to find a level this episode works at. It's a rather obvious 'Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde' takeoff, although the still human Barham is rather off his rocker. There's basically no budget, the pace is way too slow, and you don't really care what happens.All in all, pass on this one.
Scott Sullivan would enjoy: This is Bill's celestial yet mundane depiction of pragmatism. The note structures cling only to residual "wool" or influx. Scott Sullivan would become deeply addicted to this one. However, I contemplate Bill's concept of ordinary language which is structured to follow the logical development of one idea.
Maximum Numerical Analysis / $ in print today!: This is the classic work that explains in detail why numerical methods perform well or poorly. It's the best book I've ever read on Numerical Analysis. Great problems too! From Numerical Linear Algebra to PDE's the basic theory is explained beautifully. If you've ever wondered why iterating the corrector in the predictor-corrector method for solving ODE's doesn't do any good this is the book for you. As an inexpensive Dover paperback this is a real bargain!
Not suitable for undergrads in general: I feel this is one of the most dense textbook I've encountered. I have no background with Numerical Analysis and I found this book next to impossible to understand. Please notice most 5 stars reviewers use this book as a REFERENCE!
What do the vows of membership mean?: A booklet explaining and "unpacking" the meaning of the vows of church membership. To be handed to new church members who have made or are considering making these vows.
What's going on?: This cd must be considered as a perfect background-soft-music recording. This is pure ear-candy! They present the music in a way that completely removes all the true drama and emotion from the music and turns it in to a, in my ears, quite embarrasing clich. Who could expect something like this to show up in the year 2000. What can I say...let them have their fun! Turning music that was once serious and that truly expressed something real, into a circus is obviously what some people want to do. I'm glad though that most people take this music seriously instead of living out their childish fantasies about the baroque music, in a manner that would make the composers cry...or laugh!
tea dust: I agree that this tea is great tasting but you are better off buying the tea bags. I thought the package would contain little tea leaves but instead its more like coarse sand. No matter how fine my tea strainer my mug is always full of tiny tea dust. Very frustrating!
It's the score and songs that make it enjoyable: I like the movie. It is not very true to history, but that is not the point of the movie. It has a very sappy love story that was just too sappy to fit in this more "serious" feature. Overall, I really liked it. It had a good message about natural conservation etc. It is the musical score and the songs that really shine in the film. They were very hearfelt, I believed. I listen to the soundtrack a lot!
The most beautiful Disney movie: Pocahontas is the best Disney film since Bambi. The wonderful songs and the perfect animation are the principal attraction of the movie. Pocahontas can speak english because she listens with her heart (it's a childish act to repel the movie for this cause). The best scene of the film: Pocahontas and John Smith first meeting in the waterfall. Definitively: 5 stars.
I think Pocahontas is great!: Pocahontas is a great movie with fun and adventure. It is one of Disney's best cartoons.
Pocahontas VHS: There was nothing wrong with the VHS. I thought I had ordered the DVD. I have returned the VHS via UPS. I took it to UPS on March 23th. Thanks for your help with the speedy return.
Frustrated: I received Pocahontas a while ago, but just opened it... it won't play! I hope something will be done quickly to resolve this issue!
pocahontas: HI! I ACTUALLY AM NOT VERY HAPPY BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED THE MOVIE I ORDERED! I HAVE TRIED TO CONTACT THE SELLER TWICE THROUGH E=MAIL TO GET INFORMATION AND HAVE NEVER HEARD BACK FROM THEM EITHER! I AM VERY UNHAPPY BECAUSE THIS WAS TO BE A CHRISTMAS PRESENT! I HAVE BEEN CHARGED FOR THE MOVIE ON MY CREDIT CARD AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE NEXT STEP IS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM! IT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED IF SOMEONE COULD CONTACT ME! THANKS!SARAH GARRETSON
Racist Film with more MISrepresentations of Native Americans: I really don't have time to write out all the inconsistencies. Just google "The Real Pocahontas" and you will find many critiques of the film. To begin with...that wasn't even her real NAME!
Sigh. . .: There is nothing like watching a DVD, a crowning glory of Western technology, that argues that all cultures are equal. At one point in this oppressive PC film, the not-at-all historical "Pocahontas" asks how John Smith can think that his culture is "better." One might suggest literacy as a basic improvement. Or the ability to make movies. This Disney film is dull and plodding. In my experience, once you buy it kids will seldom choose it, if you have a big enough Disney library.
Disney Yes....Quality No....: Pocahontas is, in my opinion, quite possibly the worst offering ever from Disney studios *and yes, I am including the forgettable offerings of the '80's in this rating*. Highly stylized animation, a soundtrack with only one worthwhile song *Colors of the Wind* and I would say a bad plot but there really wasn't one there, all contribute to this. Even the voices of David Ogden Stiers *and he had 2 roles!* and Mel Gibson couldn't save this one. Children might like the animal sidekicks, but that is about all that will engage their interest.
Enjoyable bit of history: This was a gift for my little 3 and 4 yr old nieces. They enjoyed it very much and the younger wanted to know what was wrong with her face.Stimulating and different fromt he other movies they see. Thank you for the quick service.
Pocahontas Review: My daughter is only four but she liked this. We did have to explain to her about the violent parts, but once she heard that, she was okay with the entire movie.
Great for musicals lovers: I totally disagree with the original poster the movie was excellent in every aspect. The musicals were the best part of the movie. Pictures were great this movie is definitely worth your time. This is great for the kids. I give this a 9 3/4.
A Good followup to Lion King and Beauty and the Beast.: After the phenomenal successes of Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and the awesome The Lion King, the Disney animators brought us Pocahontas. The film was good and is a definate Disney must. It may not have instant fame or that classic appeal like the past films have, but it will be remembered. The film has music, and beautiful artwork, and the voice talents are good too. All in all it is a Disney movie worth seeing. I definately reccomend this.
Forced Previews on DVD Version: The "Pocohantas" movie is OK, but my biggest beef with this product is that Disney is now using forced previews at the beginning of all their DVDs. These are over 5 minutes of dull Disney previews that you are FORCED to watch. You can't skip over them or fast forward through them, and you can't start the movie after them. If you want to watch the movie, you HAVE to watch the previews.This might not be such a big deal if you're only watching the movie once, but if you're like most families your kids will watch this movie over and over again. Then its really annoying.Disney should be ashamed for being so greedy that they have to put this defect in all their DVDs.
Bad DVD transfer: I have most of Disney's Animation collection and look foward to the re-releases. Pocahontas on DVD is a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie. However the DVD version is NOT good. It is a bad transfer. The DVD version is grainy and the colors bleed. At this poor level of transfer, I would stick with the VHS version and wait for a better transfer version to come out.
Most underraated Disney film.: It's hilarious reading the bad reviews about Pocahontas. They either complain that the movie is too mature (it tries too hard to be politically correct, and it is too blatant in its portrayal of violence and racism), or that it is too childish (making a mockery of actual history by portraying it in a cartoon-ish and simplistic manner). So, what is it?The problem is that people already have too many opinions formed about it before they even watch it. People were already protesting 'Pocahontas' before it was even released way back in 1995! Why judge something before you have seen it? If you watch it with an open mind, you will see that Pocahontas is a wonderful movie with a great message, and that the creators took a lot of care into trying to portray Indian culture in a respectful way. Great music, great animation, great story. Extremely underrated. And one of my favorites. (:
prompt delivery: i received the dvd only 3 days after i ordered it. i would also like to say that www.tiketoy.com offers a no questions asked money back refund.
Yuck!: I was so disappointed in this movie. And it has nothing to do with the "historical accuracy" of the movie...what really bothered me was the way Pocohontas and her man apparently learned to speak each others' languages in about 5 seconds. I know they've got to condense that part of the story, but this is ridiculous!
Poco-Loco...yucky!!: 99.9999% of the time I LOVE what Disney produces!! But once in a great while everyone gets a lemon. And this is Disneys sourest!!The premise was good, but I found the animation poor and the story extremely boring. Audiences will be graced with yet another good vs. evil type story. Throw in a heroine and give her strong earthy crunchy morals and you get this dribble. And of course there is a love story. <blink blink> And as a bonus to the so so animation, you will get a so so score.The good point to this movie is Mel Gibson, who does a wonderful job. Outside of that, we are looking at a story that will appeal to young kids who have never seen another Disney flick.At least rent before you buy on this one. Perhaps your opinion differs.....
Please tell your children the history is different.: I realize historical accuracy was not the intent of the filmmakers here, but as a history teacher, I feel the need to beg you to tell your children that this is not the way Jamestown really went down. An unreal number of students enter high school believing that this film is a historical documentary, and the first step to teaching Jamestown is to convince the students otherwise.Perhaps good can come from this film, in that it can teach young people to be critical of secondary sources.
Different...: This is a good Disney cartoon because it doesn't have a impossible happy ending. But the soundtrack is the worst ever made to any Disney's animated film! It's horrible!
A good plot destroyed by songs...: The idea of making a cartoon where the woman is not only a dumb woman (like "CInderella", "White Snow", etc..,but a person with pride and intelligence, beside the fact that this doens't have a happy ending, was wasted by endless horrible songs. This is the cartoon made by Disney with more songs I've ever watched.!
Pocahontas: I was very disappointed on the DVD. I email him about it being in English and he told me it would work, and it failed to do so. Not happy at all. Pittsburgh, Pa
Great movie: My granddaughter and I love to watch this movie together. We laugh so much at Flint and meko.It was in excellent condition.
Never gets old!: We can't get enough of Pocahontas! We bought it for our Kindle Fire from the Amazon store for car trips or just some mommy quiet time. Its an excellent deal if you're a prime member.
I like Pocahontas....: There was a time when DISNEY really bring great great animation movies, one after the other...Pocahontas come from this time, and it's another great movie...it's not a CLASSIC like THE LION KING, but it's a nice story with great musics and graphics!
Pocahontas: Received the Movie today and the DVD case was broken and DVD was not stable in the package. Case will not even close. First time this as happened since I've been ordering from Amazon.
Could it be anymore unrealistic!: Okay shoot me already. She suddenly can speak English and her best friend is tree. Allright Disney I'm tired of the whacky charactors already give it a rest!
Ugh: When I first saw this movie, it was while working at a day care during my college years. We used to have a movie near to dismissal time so as to keep the kids entertained while we closed it down for the day. I have to say that it took every bit of my willpower to keep from ripping the tape out of the VCR and showing something else.Who does Disney really think they are? How dare they take our American history and ruin it? I can understand sanitizing Grimm fairy tales for modern children (to an extent though it's nothing I am fond of), but sanitizing American history?!Disney had no business doing this movie if they are so afraid to tell the story as it was. An entire generation of kids are going to grow up with the wrong idea about what really happened. Native Americans should have taken this movie on with the vigor they take on the names of sports teams. Any American should be insulted. I know I was.
worst disney movie ever!!!: this is the WORST disney movie i have ever seen and its got cheesy singing, a stupid storyline and is VERY stereotypical of native americans and its an overall failure. The movie becomes incredibly predictable and is NOT entertaining the say the least.
"flowers & trees" had a stronger plot line: silly and insipid, and as grand as the resurrected animation department at disney was from "little mermaid" thru "aladdin" and "lion King" and "beauty & the beast", crud like this only reminded one of the era od "the black cauldron".
political correct nonsense: This is a children's movie that no child should see. It is full of political correct inane, unthinking nonsense and the characters are depicted in a crass and coarse manner. No child should be subject to this foolish portrayal of the evil white man and the noble indian. I suggest that parents read accounts of King Phillip's War which raged across New England during the colonial period. Certainly there is enough criticism to go around to both groups and children should be taught a few complex truths.
Disney should be ashamed. As well as Mel and Demi: It seems to me that people are afraid to give Disney bad reviews. DISNEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED! The true story of Pocahontas was not a cute little love story with cute animals. It is a story of the white man taking advantage of the naitve Americans. I get so angry when I think about all of the kids who will think that this was a happy story and that she "fell in love." I will make sure that my new nephew will never see this piece of "junk" until he is 18. Mel and Demi should be ashamed and give their monies to proper education. Grrr I am so MAD at these folks. I wish I could give a negaive star score!
fantastic: When I heard Pocahontas was coming out on dvd I got excited, as it is one of Disney's greatest achievements. OK it doesnt have the pazazz of Aladdin or the stand out sequences such as the stampede in the lion king, but you really feel for the characters. The features on Pocahontas face are really touching, and boy is she cute! The music is fantastic, I particularly enjoy colours of the wind, but also the rousing chorus of savages, when pocahontas runs to save john smith. Alan Menkins score really adds impact to the emotional scenes. The one reason, this disc didn't win full marks wasn't for the quality of the film, but of the disc. The picture was remarkably grainy, the worst I have seen of a disney disc, even Pinocchio from the 1940's was crisper, come on disney ! Aside from that one gripe, I would recommend Pocahontas to anyone, the kids may find it a little slow, but they will find enjoyment in the escapades of flit, meeko and percy.
Everything was great!: Ordered the Pocahontas 10th Anniversary Edition and couldn't be happier with it. It looks brand new, the discs work fine, and it shipped relatively fast. Everything about this purchase was great!
thanks!: I bought this product for all the wrong reasons, for a boy, but even since he didn't work out, I have the movie and this movie is great! There are random crayola marks all over the cover, but it's cute! thanks!!!
Ecstatic until unseen scratch ruined one scene: This provider shipped the product quickly and everything appeared to be in wonderful condition, but halfway through the movie one entire scene kept skipping and freezing so the experience was ruined. I also wish I had known that none of the extra scenes would be included in the bonus features. I wish I could say everything was great but I was very disappointed. : (
Limp. Very limp: Now don't get me wrong. Check out my Mulan review and you'll see I like some Disney. I adored the Lion King, Aristocats, Aladdin, and the Toy Storys. But not this. The trouble with Pocahontas is that it just isn't that memorable. Pocahontas seems dull, not real at all, and John is just annoying. Meeko and Percy are ok, as is Thomas, but that's about it. The villain isn't either cool or horrible, the only good song is the war song, Disney took painful historical inaccuracies with the plot - and talking about plot, what's with the learning each other's language thing in 5 seconds? And the talking tree (I'm sorry, but she just really annoyed me.) There's no catchy lines - I think the whole movie was basically dull.
Bad DVD Transfer Revisited: I enjoyed the Pocahontas movie, but do not rate it as highly as the other recent Disney animated movies. I don't think it is as important for Disney to stick to the exact storyline as it is to tell an interesting story.I agree with endder of San Francisco. The video transfer to DVD is terrible. The picture looked very grainy, especially when compared to other Disney DVD movies. When viewed on an enhanced widescreen TV, there was a lot of shadowing. The video still looked better than the VHS version, but not by much. I agree it might be better to wait for a new release before purchasing. Better to rent first.
Pass On the "Gold Collection" and get the "10th Anniversary": The Gold Collection disc is too flawed to seriously consider at this point with the "10th Anniversary{ two-disc set now out.Gold Collection:1. Worst DVD tranfer of a Disney film in recent memory2. No "If I Never Knew You". Not even the rough cut.3. Extras: a Trailer and some music videos. Not much going on here.4. Not anamorphic10th Anniversary:1. Anamorphic 16:92. Great new transfer3. "If I Never Knew You" in the movie and completely animated. Major addition to the last half of the movie.4. Both versions of the film, the 1995 cut and the 2003 "Director's Cut".5. Loads of extras including a documentary, updated audio commentary track, sections for each major character with art, concept drawings, deleted scenes, scenes that never made it past the concept stage......you get the idea.
New Version Still Coming: Just a quick note here - if you are thinking of purchasing a copy of Pocahontas now, just wait a little while.On May 3, 2005, Disney will be releasing a "Special Edition", tenth anniversary, 2-disc DVD release that will be similar to thier recent reissue of Sleeping Beauty and other Disney classics.With all of the features on that, people who buy this DVD now will be disappointed if they don't wait.Disney will be adding the usual "Making of" clips, some pre-production art, and other features that make their "Special Editions" great, to this new edition of Pocahontas.
Absolutly Breathtaking: When I first heard about Pocahontas back in 1994, I knew Disney wouldn't do the story justice. Boy was I wrong. This movie has beautifully crafted visuals, strong leading characters, and wonderful music. Though for me the music works on two levels. One, of course, the obvious "Disney" songs, which get better or worse depending on the movie. Colors of the Wind is the best Disney song to date. Also the pop song If I Never Knew You blew me away. And two, the underlying soundtrack perfomed by Alan Menken. The music was absolutly riviting, as it has to be to convey the serious emotions Disney was going for. A bit depressing in it honesty of hate and love, this movie shows that animated movies can convey more emotions than just laughter.
DVD quality poor: This is one of Disney's best animated films, but the DVD does not do our favorite little Native American any justice. Pocahontas is beautifully animated, but something is really wrong with the transfer here to the disc. Colors are all messed up...John Smith looks like he has bugs crawling all over him in every scene because he appears "snowy." I don't really know the best way to describe it. As for the sound, it's an OK Dolby 5.1 mix...the songs and score are wonderful. But what took me aback from this movie when I saw it in the theater was the glorious animation. The DVD has ruined this aspect of the film and Disney really needs to hurry up and re-release a newly transferred version (I've heard rumors that the Mouse House does have a new 2-disc SE of Pocahontas ready to go...when they decide to release it, who knows.)If you want to buy this disc, I would strongly recommend waiting.
And the sentient tree will show them the way.: We rank this 34 out of 41 Disney animated movies that we own. The most interesting thing about this movie and the smartest character was the sentient willow tree. According to Amazon Sales Rank only 13 of the 41 movies rank higher than Pocahontas and 28 lower. Our family clearly liked this movie less than most. We felt it was a below average effort by Disney except for the artwork and inking.
Not the best Disney movie, but still good.: Every animated Disney movie takes a stong moral theme and bangs it into with a hammer. In this movie there are a few themes for kids to grow up on. Racism is bad. That's a major one, it's hard not to see that in this movie. Other themes include overcomming obsticles and "cant we all just live toghether in peace!" The animation is good, but the music is hardly memerable and even though the story is good, it is GROSLY different from the true story (changed to make it rated G)Bottom line, if you collect disney animation or you have kids, this belongs in your library. But it's not a movie young boys (or older) will enjoy too much.
Another substandard Disney effort: I was so disappointed in this film. The animation is lovely, as always, but the ending was disappointing and the music was definitely mediocre. If you're gonna make an entirely fictitious film about a real life historical character, would it hurt to have a happy ending? Instead, John Smith goes back to England alone. What a bummer. Rent, don't buy, this movie.
Poca Haunts Us: Disney was on a roll: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Alladin, and the Lion King. After The Lion King, it appeared Disney could do no wrong. Well, Pocahontas dispelled that myth. While this 10th anniversary edition was carefully put together, it does not hide the fact that at its core is a severely flawed and uninspired movie. The movie's slow pace makes it somewhat difficult to watch despite the brilliant colors and awesome sound. Disney fans are used to action and adventure appearing at expected and unexpected moments. And there's always a love story somehwere. Pocahontas, however, is almost devoid of any action and really does not have a love story. For that matter, there isn't much of any kind of story. I am sure that Pocahontas, a legendary figure in our history, deserved a much better treatment that this hauntingly weak Disney dud.
Not realistic: This film couldn't have been any less realistic. Not only does it take an event in history and insult the hell out of it, but it makes it into a film with horrible songs. Not that I don't like musicals, cause I do, but the fact is the songs are weak in every possible area.Pocahontas, a young beautiful indian princess (who, in reality was about 12, and really ugly at that) falls in love with Captain John Smith. From that point on, it's a total WEST SIDE STORY cheap imitation. Of course, there's the climactic scene in which Pocahontas "saves" Smith's life, although historians now believe that may have been part of a Native American ritual.This film is Diseny's apology for all those Native American stereotypes, in which all indians dance around like schmucks and say things like "How, White Man!" The film is based on all those myths that grade-schoolers are taught to believe. Nice try, Dis, but you should really know better.
Mediocre and potential to teach racist language: The songs and story line were a dud, not very interesting. Or perhaps it was just the racist language on both sides that distracted me. "Savage" "White man" "injun" "demon." My daughter is only four and so didn't seem to pick up on it, but an elementary-schooler might pick up on some of the language. And it didn't help that Mel Gibson, who can't sing, is the male lead and is known to have some racist views in real life. Finally, Disney was unable to keep any deaths off camera and implied and so it was the first Disney movie which she asked what happened to this or that character (who was killed).Pass on this one.
One of my favorites: This is one of my favorite Disney movies, although I'd wager a lot of people consider this to be one of the worst Disney movies. The use of color and song in this movie are key. It's a romanticized version of the historical Pocahontas, but it's still a fun and engaging story with highs and lows.
VHS movie: I purchased it for my grand daughter, aged 5. I thought I was ordering a DVD, but it came as a VHS. It's OK, she doesn't know the difference.
Bad picture quality: What's up with all the grain on the picture? Even my VHS copy has clearer picture quality. This DVD must have been rushed because it's obvious Disney did not put in their best efforts on this film.On the other side of things, this is one of the last Disney movies that held the style and class of other films such as "The Little Mermaid" and "Beauty And The Beast." The songs are beautiful and timeless. The animation is spectacular. This is a wonderful movie, despite it's history is FAR from accurate. I'd give this DVD 5 stars if it wasn't for the inexcusable poor picture quality.
bad online streaming: I tried several times to play this movie and it never did. I never got a chance to watch it because my online streaming expired before I could ever get it to work.
pocahontas dvd review: the dvd was excellent - i purchased it because the animation was as good or equal to beauty and the beast and the music was written by the same composer and lyricist
Review: I rented this movie for my two year old to watch she still has short attention so it was nice to have it rented just in case she didnt like it, she watched half of it the first day and the other half the next day but she loved it so we may end up buying it.
Heartwrenching: I absolutely love this movie but the end makes me want to cry. I kept hoping she would jump off that cliff and swim to the ship to be with John. I know Pocahontas never had a romantic relationship with John Smith but they belonged together in this film. Since when does Disney care about historical accuracy? They've changed plenty of movies adapted from historic events or books to appeal to children. Nevertheless, this remains one of my favorites.
Pocahontas: I really love this movie. First of all, nobody should be getting their pants in a bundle just because the movie does not exactly follow what "actually" happened in history. You have to remember that this movie was ultimately made for children and it does give them enough info to realize what is happening in the story. The animation is good, and the facial features are wonderful. But, I would have to say that my favorite thing about that movie is the music. The rest of the movie is great, but the music is magnificant. The song "Colors of the Wind" is one of the greatest songs. I also think that there is plenty of humor in the movie( most of it from grandmother willow). I would really recommend this movie to anyone.
Looks like a recording off of video: This DVD looks like it has been recorded off of video. The images are not crisp and motion has interesting color changes.
Pocahontas: This movie was purchased from seller: moviesonsale1, and would not even play half way through. The seller of this product placed information in the evelope with the movie saying that if any 0 feedback was received they would no longer be able to help you. They also gave a false phone number as a point of contact. I would never purchase anything from this seller again.
Incredibly Sexist and Somewhat Racist: I would not suggest allowing children to watch this film unless you are completely comfortable with perpetuating sexist and racist stereotypes. Annoyed by depictions of female being "saved" by male counterparts, and glowing depictions of "life being perfect" for Natives prior to arrival of whites is a bit of a stretch. This film perpetuates several misconceptions about Native Americans, which are incredibly unnecessary.
Good enough: I really expected more but it was good enough.Your money is really good used in it.The movie is amazing and a classic.
A Good Movie: Okay, I can see where some of you guys got affended from the racism in this movie, but that doesn't take from how much fun this movie is. I am Native-American and it didn't bother me, I loved the singing and my children loved the movie.
One of the best from Disney...: i believe this cartoon to be much more in depth to real-life circumstances than other ones (ie., the little mermaid, etc.). it is very deep where racial tensions are exemplified and the conclusion of the story is no less than dramatic and beautiful! the music in the story is also more than wonderful to the ears and mind. this movie is one of the only cartoons an ADULT can relate to.
Disney could have done a much better job.: I actually wanted to give this one star, but my sentimental attachment to all things Disney forced me to throw in a bonus point.I know it's for kids. I know it's for entertainment's sake. But....There is so much that is of value in the truth. I don't know why the actual story had to be turned into this PC mish-mash. Disney's adult fans will not be amused. If it's for the kid's sake, please just rent it or borrow it from the library. And, while you're at the library, be sure to pick up some of the wonderful books for kids and teens that tell the facts in just as exciting a manner.If you really want to excite your children about history, take them to Jamestown and Colonial Williamsburg, where history really does come to life!
Buy Tarzan Instead: This poking, plodding snoozer barely rates two stars. The songs are dreary and poorly rendered, and the plot is almost nonexistent. Everybody in America knows the Pocahontas legend and can state it in a paragraph; Disney fluffs it into 80 minutes of wooden characters and lousy songs. This movie has none of the zip of Alladin or Hercules, and none of the charm of The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast. Unless you want to collect all the Disney animated shows, take a pass on this one and spend your money on Tarzan instead.
A nose dive for Disney: Now just listen to me here. Imagine the disney movie life as pryimid. First we had Beauty and the Beast, then we had Aladdin, then the Lion King shot the Disney movie quality to the top of the pyrmid. Then came Pocahontas.And Disney took a nose dive.Making the classic tale of Pocahontas into a movie may have sounded like a good idea. But with all the crazy historical innacuricies you need to wonder what story it was actually based on. I'm sure by now you all know what really happened in the end. And John Smith's version of the tale was an exageration from the beginning (I have a friend that's related to our herione I know!) I do give it 2 stars for the music though, that was pretty good.
Disappointed: I am sorry I can't review the item since I can not see it at all. I contacted the company to return it and have not received a response this has been like a week ago. I am highly upset since this was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she is not able to see the movie. Would like some recommendation on this matter. My past experiences with Amazon have been terrific and will continue using Amazon to purchase other items sold directly from you.
Pocahontas 10th anniversary edition: this DVD never worked, it did not play the movie, my grandchild was very unhappy. The reason I did not return the DVD was the fact after I opened the product I placed it in my portable case and threw away the sleeve, etc. I'm very unhappy with this product I received from Amazon
Pocahontas (Disney Gold Classic Collection): We all sat down one Sunday evening with our two children - a little over 2 and almost 4 - to watch Pocahontas. We were all enjoying it very much - beautiful Pocahontas, the funny racoon and hummingbird and the majestic scenery... Then the violence started. The Indian was shot DEAD, the people were angry, the Indians were called "savages" then John Smith was seriously injured. I thought this movie was pointless and violent. I do not recommend it to any one much less any one under 8.
Inappropriate for children: Disney's fictionalized love story between the 12 year old Pocahontas and the 27 year old John Smith can only leave us praying that this didnt happen in real life. (Pocahantas married John Rolfe when she was 19 and had a child, which is, of course, left out of this movie).Even if you get passed the blatant pedophilia overtones, the movie is still filled with bland musical numbers, and boring dialogue.
My Fave Disney Movie: As a child i really enjoyed this movie and love watching it with my nieces. They are now 3 and they love it.
DVD: This is for my nephew they love this movie I wanted to get a good copy so that's why brought up mucus of the cheap
Streaming vs. Disc: Okay, so I got the instant video version of this movie. That is good for the main reason of not having to replace it, because the movie will always be in your video library (unless something should happen like Amazon going out of business or something, but I don't anticipate that to happen anytime soon). You don't have to worry about the disc getting scratched, or worried about it getting lost or whatever. The bad thing about streaming movies is that you only get the movie with no options. I can't get subtitles, and there's none of the extra stuff that you get when you buy the disc. All you get with streaming is the movie itself, which I suppose is fine, but not if you're interested in the extra bonus materials. I gave it four stars for the movie itself, but took off a point because Amazon should be able to put the full content options that the DVD/BluRay has. It is 2013 you know! I'm sure they could.
A Wonderful Disney Movie: I love the songs, characters, and plot in this movie. While some historical aspects are not true, this is a children's movie and I thought Disney went about setting it up quite well. The artwork in this movie is amazing as well. It's a movie that I could watch over and over, and I am certainly saving this one for when I have children.
Not a good French version: I bought this version because it had the French language version, and I want my kid to watch Disney in French since we live in the US and he is not exposed to enough French. I was looking forward to hearing the voices and the songs I had liked so much. For each and every Disney movie from that collection that I have bought, none of them has the original French we had back in France. The voices are different and the song lyrics are too! They also happen to be of poor quality which does not help.
history of a girl: Pocahontas is a true story. maybe not how hollywood tells it. this is a great story lets young kids see how the world was like back then.
Where's the Sound: i bought this dvd for my 3 year old daughter and when my wife played the dvd there was no soundWTF!!!!!!
Pocahonta's DVD: I love this movie...bought it off Amazon for my niece. When it arrived I could hear the disc rolling around in the case...I hope it's not scratched! We'll find out when she opens it!
Check the edition: Potential buyers should note that Amazon appears to have gotten different years mixed together. The hardcover edition linked to as "The Year's Best Science Fiction Second Annual Collection (1985)" is actually the "The Year's Best Science Fiction Twelfth Annual Collection (1995)". Obviously these are two different books.
I can operate a Xerox machine better than this: This is a poor, sloppily bound mess. Seems to be a Xerox copy of only the second volume (not even the fourth as is indicated) of the sixth edition of an 1809 four volume collection. Some of the pages are not even copied straight. Compiled with no notes, no glossary, no thought or imagination. Only contains some of Burns' letters containing some of his poetry. Worthless without context. Would be an insult to my shelves and certainly to the Bard. I should have been tipped off by the sophomoric product description. Back it goes.
Agatha: If you like Agatha Christie Novels don't miss this one. Thirteen short stories showing the amazing talent of the Author.The Thirteen Problems (Miss Marple Mysteries)
It is OK: You get what you pay for. It is just abit to long to fit in my 2006 Nissan Frontier. It is not a good radio.
If only this book were as good as their shaving products: I have three comments about this book.1. If they had not spent so much time repeating the same three things, this book would be only half as long as it is. The actual advice is sound but really you don't need to repeat it over and over (unless you're looking for word count)2. If you're trying to sell me a Cadillac, don't give me a Yugo after I've paid you. This book (the hardbound edition) is probably pretty cool as a coffee table piece, but otherwise not worth the price (see comments 1&3)3. All of the useful information in this book is also in a Youtube video by these same people.All that being said this is a really nice if a bit expensive sales brochure. I had already purchased some of their shaving products, and love them. This book however is something that I am very dissapointed in.
Please buy our advertisement: Skip this book. It's simply an over-glorified advertisement for the store of the same name. Reading this, you can enjoy page after page of "To shave properly, you need this product which we conveniently carry in a range of exorbitant prices." Yes! I do need that sterling silver shaving handle, hand crafted by the finest Elbonian craftsmen especially for me, and I cannot live without the lavender-rosemary-thyme-sandalwood-myrrh-poison ivy pre-shave oil! How did I ever shave before these things? Just buy some shaving cream you like and use a gentle touch if you want a better shave.
A finer thing in life: The Art of Shaving is truly one of the special things in life. It's a step above your everyday products and really brings the act of shaving to a luxurious chore. The Art of Shaving recently inspired an article in Finer Slice of Life blog --[...]The Art of Shaving is a wonderful store and set of products.
Absolute garbage.: You don't need to buy this - you can read the whole thing in five minutes if you go to an Art Of Shaving retail outlet. Seems to have been written by someone who A)Has never shaved; B)works for said Art Of Shaving retail store. This book has little to do with wetshaving and everything to do with selling AoS's extremely overpriced, sub-par crap. This thing doesn't deserve one star. It would make an acceptable shim for a short table leg, but that's as useful as this little pamphlet gets.
Good Fun That's Huckleberry Fun: "The Good, The Bad And Huckleberry Hound" is my favorite made-for-TV movie of all time. This has all the wit and charm that Huck showed during his syndicated TV run from 1958-1962. It is funny and just great Huckleberry Fun for everyone. There are some gags from the original cartoons that have been dropped into the show that were marvelous to see again.Hopefully this movie will make it to DVD some day. In the mean time, enjoy this movie on VHS. It's worth it.
cute and easy: This bird bath was easy to put together and set up. It is attractive and the birds like it too. It is easy to clean but I do wonder if it will rust without constant maintenance. Otherwise it is a very nice addition in my backyard.
A piece of pooh :): No offense, but you really do get what you pay for. :)(Most of the time anyway) It looks better on line.
Two Whole Discs of Bad Music: "Atrocious" doesn't adequately describe P's latest effort. It seems the only real effort he is making is to bite Tupac. Derivative at best. Irritating at worst. At least it's his last album. Ugh.
WHY??????: Master P is a commercial rapper. The only reason people listen to his music and like it is because the radio tells them too. I will admit that his beats may be "hype," but this does not justify his complete last of skills. Master P is not rap music, but dance music. Don't call it hip hop.
What's the hype 'bout Master P??: I just can't see the hype involved with Master P. His rap is slow and boring and he sounds like a grandpa!! Pathetic.
the dumbest crap i've heard since vanilla ice: Well, i've listened (actually, endured) to this double (c)rap record, and there's something that keeps bugging me.... Why did half a million people (morons, if you asked me) spend their (hard-earned?) money to buy this garbage in its first week of release? The production values on this record are a joke, and the lyrical and melodic content are an absolute joke. The only great thing about this record is that its supposed to be his last album. HALLELUIA!!!
punka$$ haterz: yall need to hear some good muzik not like this guy he cant rap.u need to hear latin rappers ! no limit goin down
NO LIMIT 4 LIFE: This iss by farr the best album by no limit rcords. It has great bass and lyrics plus lots of no limit soldiers in it. Masterp has done it again.
AN ALL TIME CLASSIC ALBUM: Ok,People i have to say if you wasnt bumping this album back when it first came out and you are just reviewing this album...Go get a life (...)Ok master is the don of rap down hurrr in the south classic is all he puts out the last don is no doubt one of his best albums put together from the start to the end its 2004 and this album is like 4 5 years old and it is still in the streets KIDS GET A LIFE AND QUIT WRITING REVIEWS WHERE U HATING ON MP......[UGHHHHH]
boo boo, this iz garbadge ull weak: DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS CD IT IZ THA MOST GARBADGE CD I HAVE EVER WITNESSED. ALL OF HIS BEATS SOUND LIKE HES BANGIN ON A POT. MANNY FRESH AND THA HOT BOYZ R WAY BETTER YOU SHOULD GO BY AND PICK UP JUVENILES THA G CODE ALONG WITH LIL WAYNES THA BLOCK IZ HOT (AKIRA)
This cd is terrible compared 2 other master p cds: i wish they didnt make into a double cd, cuz if i got 2 choose which 1 i would take, i would definately take disc 1, becuase sum of the songs have a hint of good west coast rap in it, like let my 9 get em'. The whole cd has probably like 6 good songs on it, E-40 duz a track on which made the song sound tight. But u should get Ghettos are tryin 2 kill me or True
UGHHH!!!!!! THIS SH*IT IS WACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Either you love P or you hate him! The only thing I give props to P about, is that he has one hell of a marketing scheme, and he has the ability to sell tacky a$$ records world wide. You can tell that the whole No Limit camp, don't think about sh*t when they make their albums. Everything that comes out of No Limit is wack. From the lyrics to the album covers. Funny thing about it is that P knows his sh*t is going to sell, so why should he bother trying to put together a solid album. He scribble down every choppy rhyme that comes to his head. Lay it down, then watch the money role in. How the hell does he do it?
I love Master P: I feel Master P is the best rapper I've heard in a long time. I buy all of his productions!!! It's on down here on the island!!!
ARE YOU CLOWNING ME?: THIS CD SUCKS,IT SHOULDN'T EVEN RECIEVE A STAR. THIS IS THE MOST TRASHEST MUSIC I EVER HEARD. AND WHO EVER SAID "BUY THIS CD AT YOUR OWN RISK,HOLLA AT U"
wake up...these are not lyrics...ooohhh god....: Whens the last time you stuck a Q-tip in your ears, this is simply the worst excuse at a marketing ploy. Do you think this even passes as art? This is not underground, this is pop, this is not clever, this is tired worn out and uncreative. I wouldn't have a problem with it if they would only stop calling this underground hip hop, hip hop is bad enough. please people give me a break.
a joke: anything on master ps label is a disgrace to hip-hop. Master P is the worst rhymer and delivers his raps in a truly unattractive drawl. Never innovative or creative, master p releases another joke for an album. If you want some true southern rap, get outkast or goodie mob.don't get me wrong, I didnot buy this album, but i've heard it.
Master P is horrible, and this cd proves it!: First let me start by saying i did not buy this cd, it was given to me by my cousin. (Who hates it as well) Second, heres a summary: This cd is absolutly horrible. Beats-garbage, Rhymes-garbage, in fact-Master P himself has turned rap into a joke.....he was good in the first TRU (TRUE) But thats it-now hes nothing.
this isn't hip hop ya'll, master p has no lyrics: master p is the fakest and weakest mc on the mic. anyone who buys this cd isn't a true hip hop hed. No limit and everyone from that squad is weak. Real hip hop comes from the nyc. p aint got good lyrics.
MASTER P IS USING TUPAC'S LYRICS TO SELL RECORDS.: Many people don't know this but I am going to reveal Master P's big secret to the world. On Master P's final solo album he is using Tupac's style and he is also using some of his songs. For example, Master P has a song that Tupac made called Dear Mr. President on his album. I also hear that Master P is trying to buy unrealesed Tupac songs from Tupac's mother. I personally think that this is terrible. Master P is destroying what little we have left of Tupac. Please Master P don't buy these songs. I know No Limit records can made their own songs. There are alot of talented artists on No Limit. Give them the opportunity to write there own songs. Quit stealing songs from Tupac. Peace.
Bile Style: I love hip hop. But this record is a slap in the face for any true fan of the form. There is nothing original about this record. No rhythm you haven't heard. No style. No finess. It pains me to see this album do well when there are so many underground guys out there doing it so much better. If you want to be entertained by flash and glitz this record is for you. But even that stops at the album cover. If you want reall hip hop music...look somewhere else.
Horrible beyond belief: This may well be the worst cd ever made. I can't even comprehend now why I bought it, but it was a huge waste of my money. It is truly amazing to me that Master P can make a 2 cd set with not one even slightly good song on it. If you're thinking about buying this cd, don't.
Straight Garbage.: For every step forward an East Coat lyricist takes, a dirty South rapper takes four steps back. Master P's "Da Last Don" tries its hardest to keep listeners trapped in a musical Dark Age, devoid of creativity and intelligence. This album's productions sounds like it was concocted by a tone deaf accountant on a contact high. The lyrics are pointless at best, an abomination at worst.As a rule, I like to steer clear of CDs with jewel-encrusted label logos or with the words "Cash Money" or "No Limit" printed anywhere on them. I suggest you do the same.
hahahaahahahaaha GAY: ok now youve got these fabricated hip hop fans arguing over cashmoney and no limit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ATTENTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CASHMONEY AND NO LIMIT IS THE EXACT SAME GARBAGE PEACE
He wishes he was Tupac: He totally jocks the Tupac style and his song titles and ideas are totally stolen from 'Pac. His lyrics are the results of a lack of education- not something worth listening to. The beats are simple and not even head nodding- let alone dance floor thumping. the guy is wack- a lot of people think because he's rich he must be slightly talented- he's not. I bought this album when it first came out to see what the big deal was---- I think the fact that no one listens to this CD anymore shows what a fad it was. I know hip hop, love hip hop and you P are no hip hop.
MP Da Last Don-1998: There is 2 CDs so you know that will be and issue wich it is.It has 29 songs on it and has some guest apearences and also hasyour typical what you get on a Master P album feel to it.Lyrics 6/10 Production 7/10 X Factor 3/10 Style 7/10 Voice 7/10Music 5/10 Innovative 4/10 Classic 2/10 guest 8/10 Blends 6/10Overall=55 wich is good for its 2.5 Mic rating that it getsMaster P fans it is and Ok buy no buy anyone else.
dont waste your money: If you really want real rap dont buy any No Limit, all the songs sound the same, they all sound like BS. If you want something to go crusin with listen to the DAMU RIDAS or CALI LIFE STYLE. dont even waste your money on any no limit
Waste of $$: Don't buy this album. Master P has a quantity over quality approach. 2 discs of absolute garbage. I'd pay the $20 it cost me again just so I could get rid of this CD.
this cd stinks: this is the worst cd ive ever heard he and his lttle no limit soilders cant rap!!!!!!!
Master P is wack and so is all of the No Limit soliders: I would of gave this a 0 and all of the other No Limit CDs but I can't. No Limit gets worse and worse. Sorry to all you No limit fans out there but Master P sucks! He samples way too much and puts out wack albums every month but they still sell like hotcakes. I don't know. If you want a good album I suggest Jay Z or DMX. y'heard!
Not so Hot!!: I think that master P and his whole crew needs to change there beats or something because their music just dosen't flow right. Everthing from their rhymes to their beats are tired and over used. I understand thats their style, but it's something that I can't understand. I respect him for giong out in the world and doing something many upcomming rappers/singers only dream of doing, but this CD just isn't as hot as people make it out to be.
okay/alright: What can I say about this one? This is probably the weakest no-limit project period! It's one helluva task to listen to this album all the way through. Master P never was a great lyricist, and this tedious double album lives up to it. The flowing is inconsistent, the production is so wack and commericial it'll drive you crazy. Only a hard-core no-limit fan will like this, but a hardcore rap-fan will have their dislikes about this one!Peace El-715
Absolutely Polyphiloprogenitive!!!: Words fail me before this masterpiece of aleatoric evacuation. Master P (born Creola McMorikawa) has in this, his sophomore effort, recreated in toto the semblance of a long-departed Orlando Gibbons as processed through the sensibilities of a young Hawley Crippen. Gone are all the old supportive devices, the balalaikan propensities, the Krespin-like glissandi, the intercrural obsessions. Now, in their place, Creola has substituted stalking-horse platitudes of a most Pantagruelian nature, striated with the merest Aristarchian tenebrae. What was once just a tentative progenda is now a full-blown sepsis overlaid with Reichian polemical recusations. Such proclivities were formerly jejune, but in this context they are downright crepuscular. Only a genius could have carried it off. Unfortunately, Herr McMorikawa is all that and more.
Average: Master P's last realease is only average, if you're not a hardcore No Limit fan, don't waste money on this album.
Make emm say uhhh! I don't think so.: Let's face it those days of 'Ghetto D' are over No Limit is finished. Just try and compare this album to something like 'Tha DoggFather' or 'The Slim Shady LP' and you'll see how bad this album really is. The only reason I gave this album 2 stars is because of the track with Bone Thugs on because that track is tight apart from that Master P needs to give up rap and stick to producing or try and go back to the days of 'Ghetto D'.
Rap is not any good, I'm a 100% rap hater: Why would people listen to this when you could be listening to rock? Rap just plain sucks. It isn't music, it's just a bunch of cuss words with a little beet to it. I'm lucky I never liked rap, and when I heard this Master P guy, he was worse than all the rest. If I were you, I would start listening to Green Day, and Smashing pumpkins. Now that is music. So I give this album, and all other rap albums two thumbs down, trust me, don't listen to rap.
if i could go lower than one i would have it sux!!!!!: somone aught to pull the monkey outta his butt i dont know who he thinks hes foolin and ta all you wanna bees get real
Throw it in the garbage with the other No Limit albums: Once again the don of maketing somehow got this "music" hyped up enough to have people buy it when it is reeeaaaalllly bad.I dont know how you givin it 5 stars- a real 5-star album is 2pac's "All Eyez On Me". A style Master P tries to copy every album. well, IT STILL AINT WORKIN! As with all musicians, there are always hard-core fans that will buy anything the guy makes even if it sux. I would only recommend this CD to those hardcore P fans. Everyone else- save your money and dont believe the hype- u not missin anything great by not buying it, there are much better rapppers to spend your $$$ on.
A must buy for all tha TRU No Limit fans: If you like Master P and you are tru to No Limit then you need to check this out. Its hella tight. One of P's greatest masterpieces.
Da Last Don is TIGHT: If you don't like P's last album then you aren't a No Limit Soldier. P goes hard forever.
They should have put all of there songs on one CD.: I think that snoop dogg dog bring them out on this CD If he would have stay with Dr. DRE he would be dead somewhere. So He did a good thing by getting with Master P. it's made them a better rap group.
DA LOST DON MAKES IT'S MARK!: Master p makes his mark on the rap industry felt,catchy hooks,all star appearences and excellent producing makes this album a must have in any rap/hip-hop collection.Some of the highlight of this album:Thinking bout you,make um say uh.If you don't have this, get it.
This is the worst cd ever made...: This is the worst cd ever made it is the fakest, lyrically stupidest thing i have ever listened 2 wasnt this suposed 2 be a retirement album it sure should have been master p has the worst flow and dumbest rhymes in history and the beats are terrible there is only one good song on this 2CD set and all the songs sound the same except for it. master p needs to come up with some real songs he is a wanna be 2Pac if you look at the song titles 2Pac has a song by the same name or almost the same. all master p is is a rich guy who cant rap.DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM IT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF YOUR LIFE!
You don't need it!!!: My advice to you would be to crack the cd, take it back to the store it was purchased from, ask them why they sold you a cracked cd, and ask for a refund.
I love NO LIMIT!!!!: This CD is great, even though its not as good as ghetto d. all those no limit haters are just jealous that the tang doggs are taking over the rap scene! can't wait for 504 boyz to come out...
I luv no limit, but this was no good.: I love P, and Ghetto D was and still is my favorite CD of all time, but this was a dissapointment, especially if your going out. c'mon P you can do hella better than that, come out with another, make it good this time!
I love the music and him!: To whom it may concern: I've always listened to the No limit click because they set a positive image. The reason why I think that is No limit came out strong, many other rappers take months are maybe years to finish a record label but not Master P. Now he really gives a name to rap, dont get me wrong so did Tupac. No limit just keep doing a good job because a person like me can't wait to get to meet all you guys. Try and come to Dallas, were not that bad.
THIS CD STINKS: After I had listened to Ice Cream Man and Ghetto D, I was convinced that The Last Don would be a tizite cd. But after listening to it i think it sucks. there are no tizite songs at all, the whole cd sucks. all the no limit soldiers suck except for my man c-murder, get his new cd bossalinie if you're gonna get a no limit cd.
I wish i had a cardboard box for every one who likes Masterp: THis album was as cardboard as it gets. If i were a shoe salesman i would put a pair of pumps on and throw it out the window. Have you ever ate ice cream from the Cardboard box? YO YO YO Props to my homie Royce Mcadular
there is no need for this one: forget it, it's just like any other NO LIMIT album. Don't get me wrong, i'm not really hating them but you can spend your money on other cd's. anyway say what you want P had only one blazin' song which was "make em say you what comes now: ...... peace from germany
This album is a bad omen.: People must not buy this album. The beats are boring. The lyrics are non-original and it's soo tired. Master P I'm so glad that this is "DA LAST" album...I hope you never contaminate a mic again.
IMITAITING: In fact Master P, C-Murder and silk are all imitators. They want to be hot like 2pac but hell no they aren't.
Master P - MP Da Last Don: This was supposed to be P's last album and I wish it was. There were a lot of problems with this album: (1) a double album, which was the style of 1998, with only two good songs on it ("Hot Boys & Girls", "Solders, Riders & G's"), (2) No Limit Records were putting out albums faster than Mickey D's serves burgers and with the usual guest stars on this album (virtually the whole No Limit roster) on every single song, you couldn't tell the difference between this album and, say, a Skull Duggery album. (3) is that Master P was starting to sound too much like 2Pac (like most rappers around that time). For Master P's good stuff, check out Ghetto D, 99 Ways to Die, Ice Cream Man or TRU's True or Tru to Da Game.
P is in it for the fuccin money: He puts out new cd's and videos just to boost his image, this CD is garbage, and it's worthless. The whole rap world is blind to the fact that P just wants everyone's money he even said on one of his old songs "that's why you don't see P on MTV" and look were he is now. He's a fuccin sell out. If you want real music get 2pac and Brotha Lynch Hung, the siccest muthafuccaz makin the music.
it is great he mixes the best lyrics with the best music !: this cd as well as all of master ps cds are the bomb!!!!!!this has really good tracks that any one can relate to. mater p is the best rapper along with his label no limit records. please buy this cd i have all of master ps cds and u will luv it!!!!!!!!!!!!!also look for ghetto dope. thanks for ur time!!!!!!!!!!
THIS CD CAN S*CK IT!!!!: THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST CD I HAVE EVER BOUGHT! WHEN I FIRST ORDERED IT FROM THE INTERNET I WAS REALLY EXCITED THEN IT CAME AND IT WAS SH*T. I SUGGEST CHECKING OUT DMX OR JAY-Z.
Da Last Album.. Pleeeeease?: Am I the only one that realizes that MasterP has no rapping skills whatsoever? He's a marketing genius, much props for that. How he debuts #1 every album on the No Limit label is beyond me. Lyrics are bland and overused, production is basic beats, nothing good to say about this album whatsoever.
Engrossing & Inspirational: John Adams' legacy has not been taught to the extent it should have been and seems downplayed in every other souce I've read to date. This book is a great depiction of the sheer sacrifice of him and his family at the time. this book tells how Adams was far more involved as (1) of our founding fathers than he was ever given credit. As to his analyzing his own faults, this quality proves to be endearing & proves his great character and integrity and love/pride of this great country. Great read !!!!!!
Discursive amblings on how cantankerous Adams was: Here we have a fugue on what a contrary figuer John Adams was. It is not a chronological narrative of his life--those who may want that must look elsewhere. It is a survey of his ideas beginning, often returning (too often), at his packing to leave Washington after losing his bid for a second term. The ideas explored are not systematically arranged, nor are they looked into with much depth. It tells us how much Adams just did not get along with folks, again, and again-- I can't recommend this book, especially to those of us that like a good biographic narrative, nor to those who like extensive and linearly arranged expositions of a famous thinkers thought. I must say how surprised I am at the high ratings given by many reviewers.
Author invented his Vietnam war experience,Why?: The book seemed OK , until I discovered that Mr. Ellis had invented his experience as a Vietnam Vet . If somebody does this, what's the value of the book?
An interesting, though somewhat limited look at Adams: Ellis' fine work demonstrates that, unlike Jefferson, John Adams' vision of government still has much to teach us today. While Adams was blessed with a long and productive life, the author's focus on his retirement years deprives us of some insights and perspective on Adams' presidency and his days as an ambivalent leader of the revolutionary movement.I would recommend this book highly; however, if you are only going to read one book on Adams, read John Ferlings' biography, which is broader in scope and just as well written.
Great book for seven year olds: My son loves this book. He reads it to me over and over and he even takes it to school for the teacher to read it to the class. He loves any books of transportion; planes, trains, and cars.
Breathtaking Interplay: This is an album of three incredible musicians at the height of their powers in a live setting. Lane's playing is almost beyond description. From clean comping to incendiary hyper-speed runs, Lane covers it all with conviction, emotion and breathtaking virtuosity. Hellborg's bass sound warm but packs plenty of punch as well. Hellborg is an amazing bassist who has a certain style that is very endearing. Sipe's drumming is solid without gettng too busy, which is helpful when you've got Lane and Hellborg going nuts in certain spots. There are plenty of dynamics and lovely melodic interludes along with the fiery playing. For fans of power trio interplay along the lines of classic Cream, Hendrix Experience, etc. this is as good as it gets. This defines the state-of-the-art for power trio improvisation. Nuff said!
An upset hardcore fan of The Boss: I bought this book all ready to be able to sit down with my harmonica and piano and bust out Thunder Road. The piano music doesn't follow Bruce Springsteen's piano at all. It was really upsetting. Instead they throw in the vocal melody in with the piano music. So all those people who love to sing along with Bruce don't need to because it's in the piano all ready. Other songs leave out important musical parts to include the vocal melody in the transcription. I want to know if there's anywhere you can buy the real note for note transcriptions. Honestly, I would have rather saved my money and spent my time figuring out the songs myself.
FOR GUITAR PLAYERS: Why are so many of you complaining about the piano parts being wrong in this book? This is not a vocal/piano/guitar chord book. This is an authentic note-for-note guitar transcription book, which means that the music in this book is written mainly for guitar!
This was my first CD ever bought.: I bought this CD when there was need to test the stereosystem almost 10 years ago. I must say, music by Space is very inspiring, really in the mood of 70s vision of cosmos and interstellar trips. I rate it 4 stars though - Space sound get a bit dated as years pass, not the way it happens with Jarre's music.
Great replacement Mirror - not what we thought it was: We had our mirror smashed out probably by a baseball bat so we ordered this replacement. It turns out that this glass is suppose to go ON TOP of the broken glass of a mirror and not fully replace the mirror. Unfortunately for us - there was no mirror left so this mirror is too small - we are temporarily using the mirror with duck tape until we can get a real OEM replacement. Hope this helps!
Get the spirit: Hampton Hawes sounds cheerful and relaxed in his last recording session before going to federal prison for five years, doing a jazzification of some some spirituals with which he would have been familiar from his childhood as a minister's son. And he's in superb company. Bassist Leroy Vinnegar may have had his technical limitations, but few players on his instrument ever filled the sonic space of the bass with such unerring taste and unshakable swing. And drummer Stan Levey is a West Coast jazz legend, showing a different side to his personality by playing brushes mostly on this date, and even some bells on a rollicking, danceable "Jericho". A fine piano trio date that, unjustifiably, languished in Contemporary Records' vaults for 29 years.
Everything You Could Want in a Romance...Except Anchovies!: Quinby Parker has a way with pizza and with jobs...lots and lots of jobs. But now she's a rookie, paired with a gorgeous officer, Josh Reed. Can she succeed as a cop, and even more importantly, with Josh himself? Susan Peterson's first Duet is a wonderful story that will leave you hungry for more!
Quintessential!: Hands down the best legitament live electronic album I've ever come across. It rythems and peaks perfectly, while the whole time the crowd is in the background screeming, yelling and occasionally blowing a non-anoying whistle. The real deal. A must have!
The music is wonderful but--the price!!!: I think the music to this series is fantastic and I'd really like to have the soundtrack CD. But come on!!! Did you people really pay $129.99? For a record? Is it solid gold? I'd buy it (or download it as MP3) if I could find it at a decent price.
Very poor design and lasting battery: I have bought about 11 Sony Vaio laptops for myself and family. My eldest still working with his factory fitted battery although with very short time, but enough for changing from wall plug.After 1 1/2 year The FZ140E/S battery stopped without any warning thanks to an special internal device controlling the electrical flow. I am so disappointed that a never again considered buying another Sony Viao computer.
Worst than expected: I'm a Mac user, but I decided to buy this laptop for my mom, she's a PC user and refuses to change... When it arrived it looked OK, but the camera didn't work... and a week later nothing worked, every time I turned it on, I got the system setup message....I called Sony and told them all my problems, try to get it to a repair store, but they said they couldn't do anything for me, I has to sent back the laptop to Amazon... I'm still waiting for a new replacement!
Awesome Laptop, poor content: I love the laptop but I agree with other people: SONY should allow XP downgrade and also should NOT load all of those unneccessary software. It takes forever to unistall them.
RAM problems: One of the 1GB ram memories doesn't work, notebook sent as a gift to my brother in south america, sony doesn't cover warranty outside the US, now the computer has to be sent back.....what a nightmare.
Lots of early exuberance; maybe time for reality: There's a lot to look at with this laptop. Large screen, it's pretty, it seems to work fine. But Vista will break your heart and the graphics on this machine are not sufficient to run flight simulator (and I've got machines that seem downright scumpy and they'll run it). But it's not just hotel, road-warrior gaming. Office, all of my six-sigma stuff, just painfully slow. Oh and Sony won't even begin to talk to you about downgrading to XP. There have been any number of times where the machine just seems to lock up, a few times where the entire explorer session (files and all) go away. I'm certain this would be a great XP machine, but have no idea how to do it. Sigh. I seriously considered purchasing a Mac, and this machine makes me sorry I didn't follow my instincts.
Avoid Sony at all cost!: Absolutely terrible product - bought a FZ 190e notebook in 2007. From day one the battery was problematic. Sent in for service and it came back with a note "works to spec for specified user mode" - translation the battery lasts 1.5 hours in normal mode. This is a brick that needs a AC adapter all the time. Also the mouse on the computer is horrible - have a Thinkpad from work and the mouse is 100x better. The only thing worse then the product is their customer service. My battery died at 14 months - guess what: the $400 warranty that I got stiffed for from Sony does not cover it. The single most defective part of their computer is not covered. BTW if you login into their site they dont have any history of purchases. So in summation: product sucks, sony website sucks, warranty sucks - I think that pretty much covers all the bases they could possibly mess up.
great looking but thats about it...: An awful product. I have had this computer for over a year and have finally reached the point where I will just throw it away and get a different notebook. Key problems: 1) crashes or gets "hung up" incessantly, as in several times a day 2) sony does not provide the Vista disc so recoveries are difficult 3) comes preloaded with a bunch of clunky and buggy sony software 4) has known software compatibility issues with vista and finally and most importantly 5) windows vista which would be better served with the name windows vista beta. buyer beware.
Item was not in a good condition: I ordered this item on oct 1st with 2 day shipping but got the item on Oct 2nd i was very happy with the shippment, as i had to pay nothing for shipment and i started using this Sony for couple of weeks this was very good. After that the screen started flickering and i started seeing lines on the screen. I think i got a defective peice and luckily before one month only i could find out that otherwise i wouldn't have got my entire refund.Now i am about to recieve my refund as of Nov 2nd.I dont recommend this product as i was very big fan of Sony Viao and thinking that it will last for more time but for my it was very big disappointment.I have 2 dell laptops and i wanted one more for my brother so i ordered one more dell.
Absolute junk: I am putting my one star here as a Buyer Beware of purchasing any Sony laptop. After one year, two keys fell off the keyboard. $89 for a new one. The battery had to be replaced before the year was up. It crashes all the time. The wireless connection is constantly interrupted, and there are numerous other little annoyances. But here is my biggest gripe: the computer just came back from repair. They were not able to save any of the software, including Microsoft Word, and now I've lost all the factory installed software. Because there is no serial number, because the software was installed at the factory, I cannot replace this, unless... I buy it. Now For 1,200 (the price when I purchased this junk) one would think Sony could afford to send a Repair Disc, and a CD with the standard software they installed at the factory. I am so disgusted with Sony that I will never buy ANY product with the Sony name on it. This is the first time I have left a rating of 1 star for any purchase on Amazon

Do Not Buy: My Vaio is ONE year old. I spend AT LEAST 10 hours a week trying to keeping this POS with a pulse. The wireless card has gone out which means I have to have a USB connection. Thx guys...ur the best. I can not tell u how disappointed I am with Sony. I have other Sony products but b/c of this I will definitely reconsider. BTW Sony you can also give MS a high five for letting me down (you allowed them to respresent your product).
DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!: I had nothing but problems with this computer, and I would NEVER buy another SONY product after how I was treated by SONY! My Laptop got so HOT that I burnt my forearm on it, and when I called SONY, their response was... Seek an Attorney. THE NERVE! I paid 1,500.00 gor GARBAGE. it was serviced previously, and only got worse. TOO MANY PROBLEMS TO MENTION, but to add insult to injury... They wanted almost $800.00 to repair it. Yeah, and did they think I was some dummy who would pay that? I would TRASH IT FIRST! SONY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES! WARNING!!!!!! Do Not buy their Laptops!!! I know other people who have purchased different models of their Laptops, and they are all having issues or had issues with them!
bad sony laptop: I brought this LAPTOP 2 years ago. First, I did not read the reviews online. The laptop is so hot after 1 hour and you can't put on the lap bc it is very hot. Don't buy SONY LAPTOP, it's not worth it guys. I am the fan of sony but after this one, I won't go for sony laptop again
Track Listing: 1. Patchelie2. Chateau-Rouge3. Elysee4. 7eme Ciel5. Princesse-Wivi6. Gerry-Masele7. In Memorium
Beautiful piece of jewelry.: The diamonds are beautiful and I couldn't be happier with how the necklace looks. The only thing I don't like is that the chain is so thin I worry that it will easily break. A chain that is not so delicate would be a better choice.
Looks decent, but that's all: Cheap filling that bunches up after a few months. Sewn together poorly with some kind of plastic thread that irritates bare skin. Not worth the price even though the price is decent compared to the ridiculous cost of some couch pillows.
Echoes of Le Carre: Queen & Country: Declassified harkens back to a simpler age. There were proper villians with uniforms and armies, and a wall to seperate our world from theirs. This story pays homage to the great titans of the realist spy fiction genre: John Le Carre, Len Deighton and the like. Rucka's writing reaches and surpasses the high mark set by the regular Queen & Country series. The tension of the chase scenes is masterfully constructed. Brian Hurtt's artwork in this collection is less heavily inked than in his contribution to the regular series, "Operation: Morningstar", and this creates cleaner lines and better showcases his artistic detail. An exciting, emotional story that hits all the right notes, this collection is a must-have for spy fiction fans of any medium.
Crockett Rock: I have been warming up to the Q&C series, but this one made me a fan. I loved the first collection, went lukewarm on Morningstar, hated the art in Crystal Ball (liked the story though), and really liked Blackwall (the first collection to give the reader a real sense of Tara Chace's dedication to the job and friends and what it takes to protect both). Declassified features the return of Brian Hurtt from the Morningstar arc. The inking is less heavy-handed here than that storyline and the story, already a very tense thriller, sparkles because of it. I won't divulge what happens as Crockett travels to communist Europe as a Minder, but a lot happens! A very well-defined page turning story with great artwork - what more can one ask for from a great book? Buy it!
expensive, and not too great: this product may be fine for some people, but for me it was not what I expected ... nor wanted...
this movie has three titles: this movie first off, wasnt released in 2007, it was released in 1974, second, its also called "peopletoys" and "the horrible house on the hill" when i first went to watch it, i thought amazon messed up and put a completely different movie under this name...the movie itself...less then adequate
Devil Times Five.: Agree with the first post. What caught my eye was "Sorrell Brooke" who played BOSS HOGG on the Dukes of Hazard and died in 1994.
AWB old school soul..: I love all the old school Jams...This is one of my favorites R&B groups from back in the day!! Love it!!
A good series gone bad: I read the first 16 or 17 Bolitho books in a hurry, 4 or 5 years ago, and enjoyed them quite a bit. Recently I picked up this one and was very disappointed. Rather than a good story of action and history, that I had come to expect from the author, this recent edition was dedicated almost entirely to Bolitho and Catherine mooning about each other and lamenting their separations.
Worthy successor to Hornblower: A worthy successor to the Hornblower series - lots of rip roaring swashbuckeling adventure. I only wish the series would go on forever but alas the author is deceased.
My review: The photos where very nice. The swimsuits where not always swimsuits. In one photo the girl was in a bath tub. I dont know to many woman that put one on to take a bath. But that is the only things that I see wrong with the calender. have fun looking at yours.
An informative book for mobile all-IP networks: In 2001, Lin and Chlamtac published the book Wireless and Mobile Network Architecture (by John Wiley & Sons), which laborated on how voice and data are delivered through the second generation (2G) and the 2.5 generation (2.5G) mobile networks. In this book "Wireless and Mobile All-IP Networks", Lin and Pang focus on the third generation (3G) and the beyond 3G all-IP networks for advanced mobile applications. I found the book to be very informative and well laid out for use as a reference. It has been a life saver in giving a good background on each technology.
Finally, a detailed book on all-IP cellular communications!: This book describes All-IP approaches for mobile telecommunication such as IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS) that is considered as the heart of converging fixed and mobile networks. The book describes how All-IP approaches provide SIP-based control layer with open interfaces to both the transport and the service layersThis book is an excellent complement to the bookWireless and Mobile Network Architectures, which focused more on traditional mobile telecommunications based on SS7.It is great to finally have a comprehensive hand- (and possibly text-) book on all-IP cellular networks.I have found the review and modeling questions at the end of each chapter an excellent tool to deepen the knowledge given by the authors. The modeling questions apply probabilistic modeling techniques to the topics learned.
Play Brekah's Dream and watch the world heal: Not only is Steven Schiavi a gifted musician, he is also the most gifted mystic on keen.com. He and his wife have created the most beautiful music, soul stirring, soul healing music. We've all bought a Cd and hoped it would be great, often times we regret the purchase and rarely play it again. This Cd, specifically Brekha's Dream, is really music which takes us right back to center, right back to Source, and seemingly effortlessly, restores our strength and we walk in balance again. Order this- buy this- you will love it.
Overpriced!!: The replacement filter for the April Shower Oxynator is severely overpriced on this site. Which is sold by Gaiam. I found the exact same filter at my local Lowe's for only $9.99. I saved $26.00 from buying from Lowe's.
There is are solutions: 1) Before putting any plastic "whimsie" into the pond, spray with a couple of coats an ultraviolet protective spray, clear flat or gloss is your choice. I prefer the flat to the gloss to maintain the original look. These such items may need to be sprayed again periodically to maintain their color.2) Fishing line with weights on the bottom mesured to the right length and attached to the bottom of birds, ducts, etc. to allow such things to move some but not turn over and keeps them in place and upright. I drop all weights attached to such things into the center of a concrete building block placed into the bottom of the pond and this keeps such cuties in the general area of the pond of where I want them to stay.If your items have faded, you can touch them up with craft paints and then spray them with several coats of sealer that have a UV protectant.
Easy to use & Informative: Quality product though a little bulky for travel. Options available with camera to charge from docking station or cord therefore this accessroy is best suited if you need to charge while using the camera or if you need more than one battery charged at a time.
A must for your camera or camcorder: This charger works as described;It is compact and easy to use;Easy to take it with you when traveling;The indicators are very useful;A must for your handycam.
Charge batteries fast: Makes battery charging quick and easy. No need to heat up the cam to charge batteries now.
Very Informative: Very good read. Lots of information and nice charts to help you understand what you are looking at. Would recommend to others who are interested.
Just OK: The inside pages are clean and ok. The cover is discolored and looks like it had been in the sunshine for a long time and it also had a random sticker on it. Not impressed.
book recieved: Book recieved as promised, which is more than I can say for my other independent orders I placed on amazon! This was a gift and I have not seen the book in person, but the recipient said it looked brand new and they thought I had actually ordered an unused copy! Overall, I am very pleased with the transaction. Thanks so much!
One of the best books I have ever read: I was thrilled to see that this incredible book is still around. I read it about 20 years ago and was so impressed that I gave copies to just about everyone I knew at the time. The message is worthwhile, thought-provoking and shockingly simple. Happy reading!
Amazing: I bought this product to help with the drawers on some antique dressers. This product is amazing. The dresser drawers work like new!! Have used it on other furniture in my house. I would highly recommend this product.
Drool: Two amazing CD's in ONE package! I think Solace is far better than Surfacing but Surfacing is great as well. Solace + Surfacing = heaven.
One of the best war strories ever written.: Earnest Hemmingway does an excellent job of making the charcters seem like your friends. You can actually feel what the characters are going through. You are given the basis of what war is like, yet you also get the feel of love mixed into the novel.
IT'S A PIP!: My partner got one of these, and now I'm buying one too. It's roomy, easy to install, and a snap to slide on and off the rack. You can stash essential bike tools, rainwear, snacks and such that may come in handy on a long ride or, in my case, for commuting to work. The rack is absolutely stable on a steel or alloy bike post. One caveat: don't attach it to a carbon seat post; that material is not designed to withstand the forces the clamp exerts when you hit bumps and such.
MTX Trunk Bag and Beam Rack: I purchased the Topeak Trunk Bag and Beam Rack for my stripped down 12-speed just prior to the 2008 Seattle to Portland (STP) bike ride. I found it to be an exceptional product and held everything I needed from spare tubes, small tool kit, basic junk food and a light jacket. The quality of construction is excellent and the attachment mechanism from bag to rail is easy to use and well thought out.
Rack and trunk bag: The rack and trunk bag are easy to use. I wish the bag was a little bit bigger, but I can manage to carry lunch, work clothes and a few other essentials on my commute. My only complaint is that it seems to rattle around a little bit, but so far it's been stable, and it's really quick to slide the trunk bag on and off the rack.
Great Purchase: I love this bag. Perfect for putting my wallet and cell phone in. I can also but my book in there when going to the library.
Great Bag: Great bag. I just used it on RAGBRAI. It held what I needed as I crossed Iowa. I liked the rack as well but, my only complaint is the size of the seat post clamp. As I pedaled, my legs touched the clamp. It made me sore for the 1st couple of long rides but, I eventually got used to it.
A good product but....: The package came a few days later than promised but still quite fast. However the packing left much to be desired. The bag and the beam rack were just stuffed into the box with no extra stuffing to keep the items from rolling about during shipment. This was not the usual Amazon packaging that I was used to. True enough when I installed the rack I noticed that the bar on the beam rack that secures the bag was cracked. Very disappointed with Amazon for this. Surelly thay can do better; they have before! As for the product itself , the EX looks too fragile with rack being made of plastic , I should have gone for the E type which looks like the bar is made of Aluminium instead.
Better than peeping through a keyhole: I just got my copy and am already seduced by the rich collection of photographs of my favorite Dupont family. Maggie Lidz obviously knows her Dupont family history and is amazing me with details that I had never read before anywhere else. I can't wait to read the rest. This book has definately made me want to go back to visit the Winterthur chateau with a whole new perspective. The whole family and place really comes to life with this book.
hyperbole: circumspect, contrived and irrelevant, this book is a waste of time. significant contributions to our country and culture by various DuPonts are not contained in a substantial or edifying way. even the similarity of the first reviews herein are suspiciously reviews by one person. wouldn't surprise me at all.
The Worst book ?: Didn't bought it, didn't read it, 4 years after publishing - no reviews. Bad karma ?
Full of cliches & movie stereotypes of teens: Terribly written & acted, even my kids thought it was ludicrous. There is such a dirth of good movies for pre-teens, but here are a few of our recommendations: Penelope, Little Secrets, Whisper of the Heart, and almost any Myasaki film (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, etc).
Loved It!: My 12 year old daughter loved this movie. Watched it over and over again. Perfect movie for the younger crowd.
Best Movie Ever: This is the best movie ever! I love this, you should buy this movie. How it is planned out. Its wonderful! It is the perfect length, not too short, not too long. Its just the perfect length, you don't have to get up a million times to keep from not getting bored.
Tweens Solve a Mystery: In this extremely light weight tween film, four girls gather to solve the mystery of sick kids appearing randomly at their private school campus. The title is actually perfect: Minor Details. This is a very minor film with very loose story-telling, the difference between well told decent literature and something just so-so. At every level, films can be told well, produced well and clean up well. This extends a 42 minute Disney hour into well over an hour and I couldn't wait for it to be through. It did not hold my interest, the characters were sleepy characterizations and the story was solved before it began.
About Faith: I buy it because I wanted to learn more about Faith or Christians. It is for teens but always good to learn something new.
Stops the itch quickly: Our greyhound created some pretty nasty hot spots on his bum and belly. The vet gave us an antibiotic spray that did nothing. I tried anti-itch cream which did nothing, and also neosporen when the red dots started to break open. Nothing helped. He started keeping us awake at night with constant licking and chewing of the rash, so yesterday we picked this spray up and it cleared him right up. We gave him a bath, then sprayed it on as directed, and he immediately stopped licking the areas. He made it through the whole night without licking, and today the area has gone from a bright inflamed red to a very pale pink that you cannot see unless you're close to him. I will update if he takes a turn for the worst, but as of now this product has done more than anything else we've tried. Very happy with what we're seeing.
GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY: Works fine, for minor skin problems,great value for the money..16oz for just alittle more than 8oz of the same exact product from any other store I have found.Stops itching right away.
HIGHLY TOXIC FOR DOGS!!!: For the safety of your dog DO NOT USE this product! Tea tree oil is highly toxic for dogs! My dog had a reaction after just a few hours and I had to take her into an ER vet in the middle of the night. I have tried to contact the company to find out why they are still selling a product that is toxic to dogs but they have not responded. Please for the safety of your dog, do not use this product, it is not worth the risk. There are many other hot spot and rash ointments that do not contain tea tree oil. Just google "tea tree oil for dogs" to find out more information.
Tea tree oil is poisononous for dogs - beware -: Do not buy this product for dogs and cats...it is posisonous for them leading to severe sickness or even death! Please do Read the article using this link you buy this product ... [...]
hot spot sprayVet's Best Hot Spot Spray, 16 oz. (Purchased on April 18: We used it on our puppy and the smell permeated the entire house. It made it uncomfortable for everyone and it dodn't help our puppy.I would not recommend it to anyone.
Not as effective as other brands: I bought this because all of the positive review. I thought I'd try it just in case it was better than Sulfodene. but it is NOT. Sulfodene works but it is just expensive. I'll have to try another product as well as go back to Sulfodene.
Vet's+ Best Hot Spot Spray: Please be aware that tea tree oil is extremely toxic to dogs. My dog licked this product and was sick shortly after. Check out the horror stories online about tea tree oil being toxic to dogs and weigh the benefits of using any product containing tea tree oil. I am unable to find anywhere the exact quanity of tea tree oil in this product and this alone should make you wonder if it is safe. If I do find this information I will add it to this posting.Veterinarian's Best Hot Spot Spray - 16 ozHot Spot Spray (8 oz.)
He won't let me spray him: It does help him though .whenever I can surprise him with a spray oir a wipe. I do like it.
Works better than others!: I also bought sulfodene for my six year old Doberman and it worked great but this stuff is better for a couple reasons. First, it sprays on instead of having to apply it by hand.Second, it clears up hot spots within a day or two.The only draw back is that it smells a little weird. But I think it is meant to keep the dog from licking it off.
Vet's Best Hot Spot Spray: This spray gives our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel some relief from itching. She has allergies. We bathe her in Phytovet CK Antiseptic Shampoo every several weeks, but spray her with Vet's Best Hot Spot Spray twice a day. We all get to sleep through the night.
Works well for temporary prevention, non-harmful, watch out for your pet's eyes: I've been using this products on my shepherd before and after she played in the dog park. It does a good job for temporarily repelling mosquitoes (and fleas and ticks??). She wears Frontline drops so we use this as additional prevention. Sometimes the Frontline doesn't work as well as we hoped, so this one and the Caspar oral tablet serve as our back up. The odor is not bad but slightly irritated to the eyes--kind of like mint and eucalyptus spray. So it's necessary to cover your dog's eyes when applying. I sprayed it in my car seat away from my face, but my eyes still got the irritating mist, somehow, so be warned. I guess the effect of prevention would last an hour or two, perfect for dog park or outside use!
My dogs love it!: This stuff is great. The store I used to buy it from stopped carrying it so I had to look else where. Works fast for all matter of itches - dry skin to insect bites. When used with its companion shampoo, it helps with most skin irritations, especially dry skin issues. Leaves a pleasant scent. I always have it on hand.
Smells great, didn't work for my dog's issue: I love that this is a natural remedy, but unfortunately my dog thought it tasted great too. I ended up having to take her to the vet to take care of her 'hot spot' issue.
People are idiots. Try this spray: If you dog or cat has a hot spot this stuff is great! Don't load your pet up so that its dripping with it! And if you have to apply it to the whole animal or if the dog is biting or itching alot use and "E" collar. Don't let the animal lick the shit. Would you lick it? I don't wanna hear there is no warning label. You have the Internet do a little research before applying anything to you pet. And for the person said he was upset because it didn't kill the rest of the fleas on your pet. (Your an idiot). It's not meant to kill fleas. Its great to provide almost insant relief for a pet that has a raw or irritated spot. I know some people use it for poison ivy or oak relief too. Don't be afraid to use it but with anything just use responsibly don't dunk your animal is a bucket of the shit.
Wow worth product!: My product was open and looked like it was used, the botton didnt work as well :( i had too open it and take out little plastic on bottom, i try dealing with the dealer he/she didnt want too give me another one :( i dont know if it was refurbished item? i bought it it said new but i guess not :( product dont work, buy the cream or from another seller!!!
For Allergy & Itch Relief !: We have a Rat Terrier with Addison's disease as well as numerous allergies. My wife has been a professional dog groomer for the past 15+ years and works with a number of vets. Needless to say after years of trying this and that product, it seems in our opinion that the line of Vet's Best products seem to work the best and last the longest for our dogs allergy irritations / redness / itching / scratching & bitting. The added bonus that the shampoo as well as the spray leave your dog with the pleasant tea tree smell, instead of some flowery cover up type of perfume is great.We highly recommend these lines of product!Vet's Best Seasonal Allergy Support Supplement for Dogs, 60 TabletsVet's Best Hot Spot Shampoo, 16-OunceVet?s Best Vita-Derm Healthy Skin and Coat Supplement for Dogs, 16-OunceVet's Best Hot Spot Spray, 16 oz.
Badly Written Version: This story was good, but it had some very key issues with tense and time. It was structurely all wrong, shifting from past to present tense, in a book from 1250. Put that together for me, please.
From Gods' Lips to Your Ear.: 'The Harp of King David' from Alemu Aga is unlike any other recording I have heard. The sensation of lying alone beneath a sky saturated with stars, eyes closed, with the original psalmist whispering in your ear accompanied by an instrument so unfamiliar as to transport you into the realm of sleep. All this for the price of a CD; what a wonderful world I live in.
Very Disappointing: This book obviously reflects a beta version of FrontPage 2003- much critical information is either missing or just plain wrong. Also, it's not nearly as filled with insights and explanatory information as many similar books: often, there's nothing added to what appears in the actual program's menus and wizards. The book was poorly edited and its content flow very disjointed. Its graphics are not particularly useful. This book is simply a poorly updated version of an earlier version, obviously rushed to market to be the first out of the gate. I recommend that folks try other books.
Easy to read and follow: I don't have a lot of experience with FrontPage, but this book has really helped me get everything moving forward. Good chapters and easy to follow content. I know I'll refer to this book again and again.
Good book for beginners: As someone who is not a good cook even with American food, I found this book very easy to follow with ingredients that were easy to find. All of the ingredients I either found at the local grocery or at the Indian Spice store. I made Spinach Paneer, Fritters, and Cilantro Chutney and even my discriminating Indian husband thought it was very tasty. One thing I would like to see in the next edition is having each recipe on one page, or on facing pages. It was very difficult to cook and flip pages back and forth between ingredients and instructions--especially since I was using a cookbook holder. Good vegetarian books are difficult to find that will appeal to beginning cooks like me. I am thankful to Ms. Prasad for providing a good resource.
not worth the money: The format is not easy to read and it is not well-organized. Many of the recipes are very similar. This is not an inspiring book.
Good Book: I got this book as a gift and it has become one my favourite cook books. Puris, dosas, aloo bondas...all things that never turned out right for me. But ever since I started using this book, everything turns out perfect in one try! The measurements are so accurate and that's rare in an Indian Cook Book. There's also a very good mix of South and North Indian foods and all recipes come with calorie counters and a breakdown (protein/carb/fat per serving). The best part is that the author has American substitues for all the hard-to-find/hard-to-make Indian ingredients (like homemade yoghurt and paneer). I would recommend this book to any beginners trying to learn Indian cooking in an American kitchen!
The Book Title is Wrong: The title for this book in the Amazon listing is wrong. I ordered it, and received a book with the correct ISBN. However, the title of it is "The Pillsbury Cookbook: The All-Purpose Companion for Today's Cook". I suspect that an Amazon employee made a data entry mistake: when typing the title for this ISBN, he typed in the wrong book title.I only browsed through this book since it is of little interest to me. However, it seems to be a standard family cookbook from the 1980's.
I hate ddrums: Great chops and composition,but the use of ddrums by the drummer is like cooking with aspartame.The sound is artificial with no nuance or feelings that one gets from an acoustic set.I guess they thought it was a good idea at the time.
Too bad Home Again charges an annual fee to keep the chip active: Our local vaccine clinic implanted a Home Again chip in our dog for $20 and handed me the paperwork to go online and enter all of her data. I was shocked, to say the least, that Home Again charges an annual fee to to keep the chip active. Every other chip I have ever gotten for a pet is a lifetime registration with the cost of the initial chip. I would never support Home Again in the future.... and will be registering my chip elsewhere at the end of this year. There are OTHER companies out there who will maintain your registration for a lifetime, for less than Home Again wants for one year. Do your research. Google is your friend.
HomeAgain is a great value!: I got my dog microchipped when he was neutered and figured I wouldn't need the yearly subscription but decided to go for it anyways. They provide you with free calls to ASPCA vets 24/7 if there's anything wrong with your pet. I will continue to renew for piece of mind! I called last night and they gave great service and it made me feel so much better after talking to a vet and finding out what signs to look for to make sure the problem would resolve.
do not get 24petwatch: I am just warning people on the 24Petwatch microchip.If you have a rescued dog with a microchip. 24Petwatch will not cancel your registration. So, you are linked to your pet unless someone else pays money to have the registration changed.So, if you don't want to microchip your pet and your pet already has one..when they are lost they will track down the wrong owner.
BIG MISTAKE: Vet administered microchip when I purchased my puppy. Did not realize until one year later when Home Again sent me my annual registration/upkeep fee of $16.99 that it had an annual fee I had to pay each year for the lifetime of the dog for the microchip to stay active if she gets lost. Since I have horses that are microchipped by AvidID.com and they do not require annual membership, I called them, and they said for a one time transfer price of $19.95 I can have it activated for life without annual fees.
They can't link your pet with the id chip: We just bought a dog that had been chipped. All I can tell you is that I registered the chip with HomeAgain. Then I got an email telling me that I need to register my dog. It had the right email (came to me), had the right name for the dog but a completely different chip number. I contacted HomeAgain and the customer service person didn't seem surprised or overly concerned. I called the pet store where I bought the dog. The owner talked to the owner of HomeAgain and was assured that it was just a 'glitch' and it had been corrected.Folks, tying your pets microchip number to you is the only reason for their existence. If they can't do that, they are useless.The chips are probably fine but their software is apparently buggy and can't be trusted. When our puppy is neutered, we will have this chip removed and an AVID chip implanted.If I could give this product a 0 star rating, I would.
Thank you Amazon for customer reviews!: I got my two Great Danes microchipped at my vet's office before I knew anything about microchipping. I did not know one company from another. When I got them chipped, the vet told me that I only had to pay for the microchipping and the one time fee. However, I was dismayed to receive a bill from Home again for $34.99 each year. I was disgusted with the thought of having to pay $35.00/year for them to essentially do nothing, especially when I heard other companies don't charge an annual fee. I asked my vet about getting them microchipped with another company, but he told me two microchips was a very bad idea. I just read now that I don't have to pay this fee. I am grateful indeed to hear that I actually don't have to pay this, but also think Home Again should not be allowed to get away with continuing to deceive customers. I am not a gullible person, and this is lying to customers just to make money.
Home Again Microchipping: We microchipped our dog through our vet about 4 years ago. Some of the reviews on here are inaccurate. You pay a one-time fee to Home Again to activate your membership. You are not required to pay every year to keep your pet in their system. As long as you keep your contact information up-to-date, they will contact you if your pet is located. They have a separate option that you can subscribe to annually that provides additional measures for you to locate your pet if they are lost or stolen, such as printing lost fliers with your pet's photo. I've always been very pleased with their customer service as well. They are very professional and knowledgeable.
Useless unless you pay every year: Unlike the ADIV and AKC, this company charges you for services every year. My neighbor just found a dog, took the dog to a vet to get it scanned and what do you know? It has one of these chips. He called HomeAgain to report the found dog and gave them the dogs microchip number and they could do nothing! No known address, dog name, no attempt to contact the owner, nothing. The owner hadn't paid the registration fee. I am informed by the vet that the government now requires by law that all scanners read all chips so there's no reason to use this company anymore. Check your local vaccine clinics if you are concerned about price. I paid $28 to get my dog chipped with AVID, lifetime registration included.
No way to read!: Our dog was picked up by the local Animal Control during a thunderstorm and was taken to the SPCA. (we live in a rural area) She had a Home Again Micro-chip and was registered with both Home Again and AKC. Neither the Animal Control Department nor the SPCA, DID NOT HAVE A SCANNER TO READ IT, Luckily I called the SPCA and they told me she was there and to come and get her.It is a wonderful idea if the Agency has a scanner.The AKC has a better program that is worn around the collar or you could tattoo the AKC Reg. number.I am not dissing the product it is what happens afterwords. My dogs did not have any reactions to the procedure of the implant.
No searchable archived database of lost pets: HomeAgain does not maintain an archive database of missing pet's photos that volunteer PetRescuers can refer to in case a lost pet is spotted 3 or 4 months later. Who are these volunteer PetRescuers you ask. Anyone who has microchipped their pets and wishes to be added/registered on the notification list - not a representative from the company. This searchable database would be very useful to volunteer PetRescuers or anyone wishing to reunite a lost pet by inputting color, location, breed, and other specifics. Instead as a rescuer and registered pet owner of HomeAgain, I have had to use other searchable websites such as findfido, petfinder and many more, to assist me in reuniting pets. For that extra $14.99 I pay for the upgrade Proactive Pet Recovery plan, they should at least have this searchable archived database.
Home Again Pet Tracking Micro: I returned this item, because it had to be implanted by the Veterinarian. Our Vet had her own kit, which she inserted, at a cost of only $50.00 (for the kit and her service).
I agree, very deceptive sales tactics.: I agree, very deceptive sales tactics. It just didn't seem correct when I read that I had to pay for an annual membership to a service that really does nothing but record your pet. After asking a number of friends they all were surprised by the recurring fee requirement as they did not have such a fee. I finally found this post warning that it is not required to continue the membership. It does appear that one must take an extra step to cancel the subscription, otherwise, HomeAgain will automatically charge your credit card next year.Go to the ACKCar.org website to register. Give them the extra 1.50 ($17.50 registration fee). I just don't trust a business that has to trick you into buying their services.
Steam Punk Fun Manga Style: I've always been a fan of Kia Asamiya, so shis series is right up my ally. It's a fun, light-hearted, story with elements of Batman,steam punk, and big giant robots! What could be more fun!The only downside is that I don't think Viz (the publisher) was able to finish brining the series to the U.S. Amazon only list volume 7 for sale, while volume 8 is availble from other retailer on the site.If you're thinking about checking out a new manga series, definitely check this out.
Maag and Beethoven: See my review of Maag's complete Beethoven cycle. Strongest recommendation. This one's a live recording, and very vivid and exciting it is, too. Five stars.
Kindle Edition lacks the translations: I purchased the Kindle edition of this book. Or so I thought. I have all of Legge's introductory material, but not the actual translations - which is what I thought I was paying for. It is the hamburger without the beef, Hamlet without the Prince, it is not a different way of buying the same book, but a way of buying a much shorter and less useful book.
Right price: Teacher was requesting a replacement bulb for 2 or 3 months, but district supplier price was too high. This fit the budget, was delivered quickly and the projector performs like day 1.
replacement lamp: Was easy to find on web sight, ordered it and it showed up in just a couple of days. took only minutes to install
POORLY MADE! TOP TOO SMALL AND BELT TOO BIG: I just tried this on my son and it ripped putting it over his head. They hole was too small. My other son got the white Anakin costume and it was awesome. It fit great and had an opening in the back and closure to fit. This item has a small hole and only a dolls head could fit through the hole. I have to now sew the rip and reconstruct it too fit over the head. Also the Belt fits me which wasnt as big of a deal cause I can fix that easy with glue and more velcro. Just cut the ends off and revelcro the belt and it will look great.
Poor quality costume: I have purchased many costumes for my kids. This has to be one of the poorest made. The picture makes it look very nice. Unfortunately, the leather looking overlay is not anything like the picture. The belt is so incredibly big it fits around my 6ft4inch husband's waist. I had to cut it down and then re-do the velcro. Part of the belt even fell apart the first time it was used! Also disappointing is that I am not sure this was even new. The bag had been ripped open, breaking the snap, and taped shut again. I am sure my 6 year old will still use the costume, but I am glad this was purchased for fun dress up and not a halloween costume. It wouldn't have lasted 1 block!
Disappointing Anakin Costume: This costume was for Halloween...and it was a disaster. The pants were too long...they pulled up to my son's chest. The neck/head opening on the tunic was entirely TOO small...I doubt my 18 month old nephew's head would fit through it! The belt was probably two FEET too long as well. We opted for a different Star Wars costume...and sent this one back. Hopefully it wasn't passed on to another consumer..
Cute but poorly made: My 4-year old son loved his Jedi costume but it, as other reviewers have states, is poorly constructed of very thin material. He only wore it three times by Halloween and all the seams were ripping. One shoe covering didn't fit and the elastic to hold it on the bottom ripped away from the costume. As others have said, the belt is absolutely outsized compared to the size of the costume--we cut ours. Overall, he didn't seem to notice but he will be unable to use this costume going forward to perfect his Jedi skills--it's trashed already.
Fell apart the first time it was worn!: Super cute costume but fell apart before my son even made it home from his Halloween Party at school and the costume looked horrible by the time we went trick-or-treating. It tore in so many places that it cannot even be mended! Highly unlikely I will ever order from this company again.
Not identical to the picture: Great deception after receiving the costume. Not identical to the picture. To cheap for what I payed for. Lacking a clear explanation of what of the different sizes.
Very sub-par costume: I understand that Halloween costumes tend to minimize on quality, with the assumption that kids will only wear it once. But the truth is that after Halloween (and before, for that matter!), the costumes become dress-up clothes, and they mean THE WORLD to kids.This costume is of such poor quality, I'm almost shocked. Most importantly, the belt is too large for my husband, much less my five-year-old son. And it smells of rubber so badly that even if he wanted to wear it (which he does not - despite its' 'utility belt' coolness) I'm not sure I could bear the smell.Secondly, the hole for the head is WAY too small for son's normal-sized head. We had to make a cut in the hole to enlarge it.It's really disappointing. Halloween means A LOT to kids of this age, and I just can't believe that it can be that difficult to produce a decent-quality costume for kids - who will wear it again and again.
Disappointed: I live in Brazil and I bought this item to send to a friend that was coming to my city. when arrived the pants was soo big, the shirt did't fit, because can not get into the head. Excuse my english but I'm brazilian and is not my mother languague.
don't bother: My son was so excited to get his Jedi costume this year for Halloween, but I wish I hadn't bought this one. the colors didn't even match the picture, the product was extremely poor.
Anakin Skywalker Costume: The costume was great. Could be a little better made for the price, but overall very happy with it. The rubber belt was way too big for my 6 year old though.
Not as Shown: Beware this product does not come as shown. Made completely out of cheap fabric - no pleather/fake leather material as shown in the product picture. Very disappointed. Belt too big. Head opening too small. Luckily my son didn't notice.
Cheap!: My 5 yr-old son was so excited but when we opened the box the costume was not as shown. The belt was too big to go our my adult waist, there were two holes that appeared to come from a sharp object cut (not tear) and the outfit appears to be coming apart at the seam. The disappointment put my little guy in tears.
Expensive product, poor quality!: Really expensive for a poor quality costume. The belt is HUGE, made of a sticky rubber-like material, and poorly manufactured (pieces falling apart before use). The shirt/tunic is asymmetrically stitched making one shoulder longer than the other. The collar of the shirt is already unstitching. Cannot return because my nephew (as any child) doesn't care and keeps playing with it.
make sure this is what you realy want ...... the return shippig is going to cost you a lot !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: i got this for my 10 year old son and it did not fit him,the pants is too long and the shirt is too small !!!not good at all .they charged me for shipping seperate than my rest of orders and had to pay double of what i paid for shipping to return it.no no no for this seller.....
great costume: after much debating w/my son we decided on Anakin! The costume was great he looked so cute in it. The only complaint is the Utility belt. It was HUGE! We had to zip tie it so it would fit him correctly! Other than that Great product!
love it: my 6 year old son loved it. worn it once, started tearing a little bit, but its a costume so as to be expected. totally worth it. brought many smiles!
Everything is great with this costume except..: This costume was great, EXCEPT for the belt that comes with it. The costume fit well but then I went to put the belt on my son and it was HUGE! So big the belt falls to the floor. You can't adjust it, there's only some fixed velcro to hold it on.I emailed the vendor asking if maybe a large size belt got in with the small costume and he said no, it was the same size belt for all sizes of costume!Otherwise, I'm happy with the costume in all other ways.
Extremely unsatisfying: I understand this is a child's costume, but as an adult making choices on behalf of our children, the item you receive should actually look like the costume. We received what we ordered, and even the product picture on the packaging looked nice..... but the actual costume was all one color - brown. There is no black like you see in the preview. It really looks awful.The belt is ridiculous. I wear size 36" pants and I can wear the belt provided. We would have to cut up the belt and add Velcro tape to fix this for my son. I think everyone understand that not everything is going to fit perfectly but this is just a different story.My son actually wanted to look like Anakin for Halloween and not some kid with layered brown polyester tunic. I would advise to look elsewhere for Halloween.
Cute costume: My 6 year old son is a HUGE Star Wars fan and loves this costume. Everything is a decent fit except the belt! As I've read in other reviews it is practically sized for an adult! I think I'll be able to secure it with a large binder clip with the silver painted black, though.
Size Description Misleading: The size small 4-6 has the wrong recommended age in the description. The Amazon description says 6-8 year olds, but when the costume actually arrived, the packaging indicated it was for 3-4 year olds. This is completely confusing as the sizing says 4-6. It was way too small for my 5 year old son, who is average height and on the slim side.For almost $30, the fabric is very flimsy and the belt looks nothing like the photo.
Junk: The belt broke as soon as my son put it on. There are threads hanging from the seams, looks terrible. It is complete junk! We bought size Large for my 7 1/2 year old son & it is way too big. My fault as it said 8-10 years old on it. I thought it was size 8-10, but it was size 12-14. This is going back.
Yuk: Returned this item. It was not good quality and the size was not even close. Would not recommend this item.
Looks nothing like the picture: This costume looks like it has a heavy leather-like tunic and boot covers. Not even close. The belt looks nothing like the picture either and is way too big. It's supposed to attach with velcro but I have to tie it like a sash. Thankfully my son likes it anyways, but I would not have chosen this had I been able to see it in store. I really wonder weather they didn't stuff the package with something different!
Too small: My very small child can't even get his head through the hole. His head would have to be the size of an infant to make it through. I will have to return this product.Star Wars Child's Deluxe Anakin Skywalker Costume, Small
Not the gratest quaility: For the price, the fabric should be a little better quality, my son loves it, but everytime he gets stuck on something the tread just pulls away, like a loose pice of hear!
Thought Leadership at It's Best: Compelling insight on the importance of technology-driven business strategy. The only book that addresses this approach in a completely comprehensive way, challenging business leaders to rethink their approach to strategy and change. The "flexing" of business and IT architecture is thought-provoking, dynamic, yet critical to where business needs to be in the near future.And the "evolve or dissolve" subtitle best summarizes the nature of businesses today. I will read it again with my highlighter.
Never discusses history: This book never covers the importance of an individual's history. Are you predisposed to this? Did you cheat in previous relationships? Did you feel that you could always have everything? and what about the out-bursts? He says to refrain from angry out-burst, they are Love Busters. They are necessary! The betrayed spouse needs to get this stuff of his/her chest. His/her life has just been shattered into a million pieces I was very disappointed. Dr. Harley's job is to get people back together, no matter what. I would not recommend this to anyone!
Excellent insight into how affairs occur and how to survive.: I've read several books on surviving the pain and confusion of an affair and Dr. Harley's book clearly stands out.If you or someone you know is suffering from the effects of an affair, I highly encourage you to get this book for them.This book helped my wife and I significantly.
This book is helping me and my husband.: I didn't think it was possible for me to ever begin to trust my husband again, and then I read this book. This book illustrates that by commiting to and applying some common-sense rules, there is hope for relationship repair and even growth. The examples used from the author's experience and practice are amazing, and served to keep me engaged and reading through to the practical part. I found many ideas helpful, especially the concept that men and women, although they will list similar top 10 needs, usually pick a different top 5. This book makes sense and helps you to pick up and actually do something for yourself and for your relationship in the face of the overwhelming emotions you experience when your spouse has an affair.
This book is ok. I don't recommend it.: Harley has a firm stance on making marriages last at all costs. Sometimes the memories can be so haunting that it may be best to move on. There are several points in the book where he tells one member of the couple what to do. This is in opposition to most (individual) counseling sessions where self exploration is key, and where the client ultimately determines what they should do. I think there are some good points in the book, and it's a quick simple read. I also don't particularly like that his theories are not backed by research. It seems like he is pulling the four rules to marital recovery out of thin air just because they may sound like they work. I recently purchased His Needs, Her needs by Harley to get a better understanding of his style but after reading this book I'm not looking forward to reading that one. Overall this book is 2 stars and I would recommend it. I hope to find better books on this subject.
I was disappointed in this book: I was very disappointed in this book. It inappropriately places blame for an affair on the wounded spouse. While it is true that both spouses bear the blame for a marriage that is vulnerable to an affair, only the spouse who choses to be unfaithful bears the blame for the affair. I found this book to be very incomplete regarding good advice for dealing with the very real physiological, emotional, and mental effects of the discovery of an affair. It seemed to be more focused on making the unfaithful spouse feel comfortable than on dealing with the issues that must be dealt with to salvage and rebuild a marriage. I think there are more helpful books on the market.
The story of John and Sue: First I want to say the writers of the book are very knowledgable about the subject of adultery. However, my big issue with this book is that it follows mostly 1 couple's affair (another one is talked about) THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE BOOK. Both give examples of an extremely difficult situation to over come, the other not so difficult. This is a good contrast I guess, but for me, my wayward spouses affair/situation was right in the middle. A few things I read made me feel as though it would be impossible to get past my own husband's affair. I do think it has some good tools to use, meaning having all your "love banks" filled. With that said, there were times I just couldn't wrap my brain around getting over the affair then having to do all this work? It is probably best if one reads this book when away from the situation and a little more over the affair. But for me, I got very tired of reading over and over about "John and Sue's" situation....continually throughout the book.
TIME TO HEAL: This is a great book to read for married couples that want to stay together after an affair. My husband who had an intimacy issue said he learned more about relationships from this one book than he did in his entire life.I learned alot also, especially about Love Busters (my main problem). I recommend this to anyone trying to deal with the pain of an affair. I also recommend his other books for those in a marriage or serious relationship that want to prevent this kind of pain.My husband and I are planning our future and loving each other. He is now the type of husband I always dreamed he could be.
question: Sorry, this is not a review. I'm looking for a book that helps with dealing with an affair AFTER you've been dumped, divorced, whatever. It seems as though most books that cover affairs deal with working on the future of the relationship, not with betrayed people trying to put their lives together after being cheated on and left for the other person. There's divorce books, and affair books, but is their a book that covers both?
No good for the cheated-on spouse: This book uses an extremely arrogant affair as the scenario to base its assumptions and rebuilding on. It places too much blame/stress on the spouse that wasn't cheating to heal the relationship and doesn't let the hurt spouse acknowledge his/her feelings. (In this scenario, it's the wife that did the cheating and will not/does not want to end the affair.) In addition, it uses trite phrases such as "Love Busters" in order to rebuild the relationship. I do not recommend this book unless you are in the same scenario as this couple. I have found other books to be more instructive for both parties involved that present more realistic and varied scenarios to base advice on.
forget personal trainer: First off I have to say that I have used exam cram to pass my last 3 exams so I know that they are very useful.The problem I have is not with the book but with the personal trainer part which to me seems like nothing more than an electronic version of everything that is in the book.It goes chapter to chapter along with the book ,The only thing good about it was the test questions.They should have offered the book with a disk of tests not with the same thing I just read.
widerruf: meine erste besprechung von "mr bewley in berlin" sollte nur das interesse an dieser ausgezeichneten lektre wecken. skandal!
Terrible!: This monitor was terrible! Even with the volume turned all the way up both on the child receiver and the parent receiver, I still couldn't hear my son. Sometimes I would hear him crying from the other room but couldn't hear him on the monitor! Useless! I liked the light show so we bought the FisherPrice Flutter Bye Crib Attachment, which has a light show, and then traded this monitor in for the Fisher Price 900mhz monitor which has crystal clear reception.
LOUSY MONITOR: I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO BE USED AS A BABY MONITOR. I HAVE TRIED TWO OUT AND THEY ARE BOTH WORTHLESS. YOU CAN NOT HEAR YOUR BABY THROUGH IT, WHICH DEFEATS THE PURPOSE.I GAVE IT ONE STAR FOR THE COLORFUL LIGHT SHOW THAT IS CUTE. BUT AS A MONITOR FORGET IT. FISHER PRICE WILL NEED TO REMAKE THIS IN ORDER FOR CUSTOMERS TO WANT IT. THE LIGHTS AND SOUNDS MONITOR IS LESS EXPENSIVE AND OF MUCH BETTER QUALITY.
Does not work!: Absolutely can not hear my baby. My husband even yelled into it from another room and I could not hear him on the monitor. The automatic feature really does not work. The light show is good, but only stays on for a few minutes (then will not turn back on to crying because the automatic feature, as I mentioned does not work). DON'T BUY THIS!
Very Disappointed: Great concept but really bad design/engineering. Sensitivity wasn't great (baby has to really scream to get it to turn on by itself) and I agree with everyone else that the sound quality sucked - would often hear him crying through the door when the monitor wouldn't pick up a peep (even with sensitivity turned way up). But that was acceptable with the first one we because of the light show and music. My son absolutely loooves the light show on the ceiling! But then that quit working after 5 months. Changed the bulb, took it apart - projector just would not turn on any more. So we exchanged it for a replacement (no problem at Babys R Us) which the light show again just suddenly quit working. This time only after 1 month. I think we'll take it back and get a monitor only and some other light/music thing for the crib.Also - the turning on of the music & projector was a pain - have to constantly flip each off/on; off/on - probably what causes it to quit working. The switch wears out.
Bad choice: Our son loves the lights and music, but the monitor is not a good product. It has static feedback on both channels at any volume level and the noise activation system does not work unless you stand over it and shout.
Definitely not recommended: The main reason we liked this monitor was for the light show. This light stopped working when my daughter was 5 weeks old! And there is tons of static and buzzing. Definitely not worth the money!
too musch noise!: My husband and I bought this monitor because it was the cutest one, and matched our aquarium set that we bought. We really liked the projection and light show. We figured a monitor was a monitor and it didn't matter what type. We were wrong. We tested it out and it was fine in the baby's bedroom, no noise and it picked up the baby's noise. However on our end, it was a constant buzz that never went away. So when we were sleeping it was very irritating to have a constant buzzing in your bedroom all night long. I would not purchase this monitor again.
light show ended at 8 months...: We never used it as a monitor because the reception was awful. However, the light show and music was great! Until it stopped at 8 months. I called FP and they are sending a lightbulb replacement as a curtesy, Whoopie...they only last approx. 15 hours. Not worth taking it apart constantly to replace the bulb.
Projector died twice within a year!!!: We got this monitor for a shower gift and thought it was the best thing with the projection of the fish on the ceiling. After only having it a couple months the projecter died on us. We exchanged it for a new one, now about a year later the same thing happened again. I am very dissapointed in it! My daughter who is almost a year loved watching the fish swim and now all she can hear is the noise and looks all over for the fish. The monitor also had a big interference problem, whenever the heat kicked on, there would be soo much static and noise I had to turn it all the way down. It was terrible! I do not recommend this monitor at all to anyone!!!
worst monitor ever.: This monitor was a gift when my daughter was born and I am so glad that I did not waste my own money on it. The projector quit working after 2 months and the static on the receiver is unbearable. We can't set anything next to the receiver or even walk by it without the static getting louder. We are currently looking for a new system.
Doesn't work as advertised!: This monitor is horrible and a waste of money. We wanted it, despite the fact we had another monitor, because it matched our theme and we had all the Ocean Wonders Items. We have never been able to hear our child over the monitor, regardless of how close the monitor is to him. You can not even hear the music that the monitor plays. The sound activated feature has never worked. We use it, but we have to start it ourselves and use another monitor to hear our baby. Very disappointing!
Terrible: I bought this monitor based on all the information that I read about it. The music and pictures don't turn on when he cries. We have the volume turned all the way up and the only way you can hear him is if you have the receiver pressed to your ear. We tried everything the instructions said and nothing worked!!! I was really impressed with all of the other Fisher Price Ocean Wonders items that we registered for except for this monitor. I would not recommend this product to anyone!
unhappy mama: This was a gift, so I now have no box. I was excited as I thought the automatic sensor would give my baby viewing pleasure. The sensor dosent even work, not even with me yelling at it. I cant believe FP. Dosent recall this product. It's horrible if you are looking for this benefit. The light show is pretty cool, but it only stays on for ten minutes.
Great concept but a huge waste of time and money.: I bought this for my 6th child thinking what a great idea, something that will respond to the baby crying and allow me to hear at the same time. What a joke I have only had it for about 5 weeks and the light show died after 3 weeks, it would shine but not turn now the bulb is dead as well. Good old customer support says you must have the monitor in hand in order to troubleshoot the problem. Just what I have time for standing around holding the monitor while juggling an infant and dealing with a 2,4 and 6 year old. Don't bother with this product Great concept but a huge waste of time and money.
HORIBLE: The light show is cute, but too bright! not a good idea when you're trying to get your baby to sleep. But worst of all is the quality of sound you cant hear the baby, all you hear is a buzzing sound. Not worth the money!
Don't waste your money!: Even though I had read poor reviews of this monitor, I was determined to buy it since it matched my theme. I figured that my experience would be different. Unfortunately, it wasn't! If you love listening to FUZZ, then this is the monitor for you! It's actually hard to hear what my baby is doing over the fuzz! If I could do it all over again, I'd listen to the reviews & buy one that was proven to work well for my baby!
Not what I expected!!!!: I wanted this monitor because of the fact that it said it was sound activated. When my baby cries the music is suppose to start and the light show is supposed to turn on. I put it to the test before I put my baby in the crib. I stood at the location of the crib and made a few noises.........it didn't activate it. I stood closer to it and made some more noises and it still didn't work. I have yet to see this function work on our monitor. I don't have the other problems as far as not hearing our baby in the monitor. The sounds are not clear, but I can hear her!
Talk about absolute worthless piece of electronics: I can't believe how this monitor ever made it to the market. OK. It's got an interesting idea - but work on the basic stuff first: the radio communication between transmitter and receiver. The baby sees pretty lights and mom and dad hear loud, indiscernible static. Baby could be choking in his sleep, but mom and dad would be happily listening to static. What a joke. We got this as a gift, and it's on it's way back. Leaving the doors open to the baby's nursery would work better than hooking up this monitor.
This monitor is horrible!: I am incredibly disappointed in this monitor. The only good thing about this monitor is the light show. The reception on the receiver is horrible. We can't hear our baby unless he's screaming and even then its hard to hear. Plus all we hear is static. It doesn't matter what channel its on or where its positioned in the house, static is the only thing that comes through! I would not recommend this monitor to anyone.
disappointed: I was disappointed to find that this name brand item was such a dud. I COULD NOT HEAR MY BABY, which defeats the purpose of a monitor. I didn't have any bulb or battery problems, as others did. Every time my baby cried, the monitor did not go on, which is one of the features I was seriously looking foward to. The only nice feature is the pretty fish projection and sounds. Since I already threw out the box, I cannot return it, so I will use the projector feature. along with purchasing another monitor.
NICE light show BAD reception: Nice light show but awful reception!! Can't hear baby crying full lungs unless I'm standing right next to the monitor, which doesn't help if you have a noisy house already! Definitely would NOT buy again, and we are having to contact Fisher Price now hoping to get a replacement monitor sent... since we already threw away packaging. Yuck.
Not Worth Buying: I bought this thinking I could tackle 2 things at once (the light show and a monitor). I was wrong. The light show is great but the monitor does not work well. You can barely hear if the baby is making any noise and that is with the transmitter and receiver volumes all the way up. I do not recommend it at all.
Cannot HEAR baby!!!: I bought this thinking that I did not really need a powerful monitor for my SMALL apartment. But, even in my SMALL apartment, I could not hear the baby on the monitor. Thank goodness I received an old monitor from a family member. My daughter is too young yet to appreciate the lights on the ceiling. I'm sure she will like it as she gets older.
Horrible Monitor!: This monitor was terrible! I could barely hear the baby when the volume was turned all the way up. My 5-year old daughter actually woke me up one night to tell me the baby was crying (her room is right next door to the baby), all I could hear from the monitor was the constant "buzz"! The very next day I returned the monitor and bought the Fisher-Price Private Connection 900 MHz. I love it! It has crystal clear reception and it even comes with rechargeable batteries!!
New Aquarium Monitor: I also bought this as a baby shower gift. For my friends sister who's having a baby in november.She's thrilled with it.
AWFUL!!!: I BOUGHT THIS MONITOR THINKING MY DAUGHTER WOULD LOVE THE LIGHT SHOW AND SHE WAS ACTUALLY SCARED OF IT- EVERYTIME I TURNED IT ON SHE WOULD START CRYING!!! THE STATIC ON THIS MONITOR IS AWFUL!! YOU CANNOT EVEN HEAR YOUR BABY CRYING!! I HAVE TRIED TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL AND IT JUST GETS WORSE AND MY ROOM IS RIGHT NEXT TO HERS- YOU WOULD THINK I WOULD HAVE ULTRA CLEAR RECEPTION! NO WONDER THIS MONITOR WAS ON CLEARANCE!!!
Flakey and Poorly Made: This thing is not well made in our opinion. First the power supply for the reciever went bad.The the projector would start going on and off in the middle of the night waking and scaring our child.In fact Im tossing it in the trash today.
Disapointed!: I am so disapointed in this item. I love the fish projection & music, but the monitor itself is horrible. I hear the baby screaming from his room, but do not hear him through the monitor. No matter what we do the moniter buzzes. I am taking this back!
bad light show: We finally decided to buy this monitor after replacing the bulb every week on our "older" model(which I thought was adorable!)This new light show totally blows. It looks nothing like what is represented on the box and is completely fuzzy looking! I wish I could replace the bulb again on our moon and stars monitor but the screws are stripped. Fisher Price really needs to get with the program. Do they assume that people are going to just eat their crappy product because they are too busy to return it , rather than doing the right thing and recalling it?
Baby monitor does not work but light show ok: I've read a few of these reviews and think that Fisher Price must have a quality control issue. Our monitor does NOT work under any circumstances, even after reading the manual and having all the handy people in our family try to make it work. A friend of ours gave us a Sony that works AWESOME! So I don't think it's user error. We should send the unit back but I can't be bothered -- our solution is just not to buy anything with the Fisher Price logo in the future. To those of you who bought one of these that works, congratulations, one must have escaped working from the factory :)
Pass on it.: I was given this monitor as a gift. I think it may have been defective besides the fact that it didn't work very well. First off, it's supposed to turn itself on when baby makes a noise. Even with me talking at full volume in the room it never turned itself on. Also, the static was horrible. I could kinda hear my son babbling in the background, but if I had been trying to sleep instead of answering emails, then forget it. But the music it has was nice, and the lightshow could be good at night. It didn't attract my son's attention during the day.So I returned it, and I'll be buying something with a better rating.
Room for Improvement: I unlike some other parents don't have a problem hearing the baby, although I do get the static. My husband also had to fix the monitor to get the light show to work, the following night we had to replace the bulb. We've been through I believe 3 bulbs and our baby is only 2 weeks old. The ocean sounds do soothe him to sleep and the light show is great too...when it works.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!: I wanted this monitor soo bad & I'm soo disappointed!! I wanted it b/c it's has "Smart Response" it's supposed to come on when baby cries. Well the first thing I noticed is on the parents end all u hear is the motor if the light show is going & then if the musics going all u hear is music or worse BOTH!! So when ur baby cries IF THE LIGHT SHOW CAME ON!! That would be all you could hear!! But being we have a small house I could have lived with that! BUT!! YOU HAVE TO SCREAM TO GET THE LIGHT SHOW/MUSIC TO COME ON EVEN ON SENSITIVE!! I recomend the Evenflo Whisper Connect for a monitor (i could hear her breath if i turned it up!!) If you want a light show too Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Mobile With Remote Control wasn't quite as good of a light show but it worked which is the point!!
Worthless: This monitor is a great idea, but not worth the money. I can't get my light show to work at all. My husband spent half an hour trying to fix it, but you shouldn't have to fix something that is brand new. UPDATE- He fixed it. The light bulb inside the main unit needed adjusted so it could fully touch the metal part. I still have to check out the clarity.
Piles of useless information....: If I could own just one survival book, this certainly wouldn't be the one. I hear that it makes pretty good tinder though....
Don't buy this book.: There are hundreds of books out there with better information that are easier to read. Here is a sample of how the book is written."Although fires may as we have considered be lit by several primitive methods, this can be accomplished neither so surely nor so easily that many will care to go into the bush without a waterproof case filled with long wooden matches."There are no typos in this quote. that is exactly how the author speaks in this book. I was very upset when I got the book home and started reading. Don't waste your money here.
Little book, big knowledge.: Ideal reading for hunters, campers, and all lovers of the great outdoors. Packed with vital information related to survival in the wilderness.
Definitive guide to wilderness survival: The Algers "wrote the book" on wilderness survival. They have written on many survival topics from theor own experience living off the land. I highly reccommend it to all of my Boy Scout Troopers.
Interesting Read, but opens a can of worms.: I haven't quite finished this book, but chapter after chapter I have found myself wanting more. Don't get me wrong, it is an excellent book, lots for anyone interested in survival, it will just make you want to find out more about most of the subjects discussed.
How to stay alive in the woods: Pretty general in nature and not specific enough to be of any value. Any Boy Scout learns more about survival in his early years than is told in this book. As far as I am concerned this is a waste of time in reading. It has just enough information to make a person dangerous to themselves in any life threatening situation.
NOT the survival book for you!!: This book is NOT the one you should pick, regardless of your background. For the inexperienced suburban/urban wilderness lover, it has some outdated info and simply isn't that useful without any pictures. For the more experienced survivalist, the packaging alone will be enough to turn you off (a bit too "Martha Stewart meets the woods"), not to mention the overly-simplified approach it takes to basic survivalist skills. As someone who has spent time on a mountain rescue crew, I can attest to the role books such as this play in getting people WAY over the heads in the great outdoors. If you insist on getting a survival manual, keep looking.
poorly constructed - don't buy this version: We were passing this book around in the days following Christmas when we noticed that the inner back binding was torn. There is no flexure in the spine of the book. My son went home with book that was falling apart.The other comments regarding the outdated writing are right on the money. Nevertheless, I am going to try and find a paperback version if one exists.
Excellent, except the pictures: This book is primarily focused on survival in the northwestern United States and Canada. The pictures leave something to be desired, but Angier's descriptions are excellent. The book a bit dated, but for theoose looking to go back to simpler times, the lack of GPS systems and Gore-Tex may be just the thing.
Know the basics.: Changes are inevitable, and you may find yourself in a position to know how to survive in unfamiliar terrain. This books provides a heads-up for the woods. Know the principles so that you can apply them.
Great Compendum: Close to everything you'll need under one cover. Many of the items covered in this book are true life savers.
Great tidbits and info: Contains tons of tips on what to eat in woods, plant-life, building a fire, staying warm, etc. Hopefully won't need it, but sent copies to 2 hearty outdoorsmen who know the woods, but not to this extent!
Works as it is supposed to: I purchased this charger with the TuneStick so I could play my ipod in the car and keep it charged up for long trips. When I drive it is often at least 2-3 hours away. This charger has worked perfectly for 2 years using it at least every other week for 2-3 hours at a time. Finally died last weekend so now I'm back for another. I feel I got my money's worth.
New-age mush: This album should be classified as new-age rather than World Music. The African elements are overshadowed by slick Western production values and a relentless desire to please. The lyrics are pretentious and self-indulgent; the music so "soothing" that I wanted to throw it out the window. What is this supposed to be? Music for the Lite-FM crowd? Background filler for the dentist's office? A Disneyland version of Africa? Anyone contemplating buying this album would be much better served by trying Rokia Traore, Remmie Ongala or Baba Maal.
Unbelievably cool piece of art it is: I really dig this music, J. Hellborg is one of the best and most original bass players of this era. On this album he plays with G. Velez, percussionist and overtone singer. The album and track titles may sound rather bombastic (or meaningless) for the non-inititated eye, while after a decent listening you certainly get the point. One would hardly think that a duet of a single percussion and a bass can give such an ease of mind.
Hard rocks of pork: This wasn't crackli'n it was more like Rockli'n. Every bag was full of rocks of pork rinds. I literally chipped a tooth eating this. Avoid it....it's not worth $0.50 out of a vending machine. Low quality.
uch: this product is very, very, very salty and has a mushy texture to one side plus it tastes burnt - refund.
A Nice Push to Put You to Sleep: This product does what it states. It gives your body the slight push it needs to fall asleep when you're having trouble. I like the sublingual tablets because they seem to work faster than the traditional pills you swallow and they have a pleasant orange flavor. My only gripe is that they don't dissolve as easily as other sublingual tablets I've taken. These require you to move them around under your tongue to get them to dissolve. Others I've taken dissolve quicker without manipulation under your tongue. Still, this won't stop me from buying these again. They do what they're supposed to and the price is very reasonable.
Omega constellation Watch: I am very dissapointed with the product. Maybe it sat on the shelf to long. Its a Quartz watch once it has a battery it should work, This item fail after less than a months wear on the wrist of a woman who was so proud to have the item until she gave away her other watch to a friend because it didn't have a diamond bezel. We have sent it in for repair but we don't expect it to be good even if return because a jeweler said that there should be nothing to repair in a Quartz watch. It was pretty, it looked good, but boy what a dissapoinment!
Wrong toy, but good customer service: Originally I thought this toy was the larger version because that was how it was labeled. When it arrived though, it was the smaller version from the McDonald's Happy Meal. The seller refunded the money in full and also apologized for the mix-up. If you want the smaller version then this is the toy for you, but if you want the larger one keep looking!
Don't even think of ordering from this outfit!: The drill advertised as 18 Volt, came through with 18 Volt stickers/labels on it but didn't have the weight I expected. I looked at the charger and it said "9 Volt Only" so I checked the battery pack. It said 18 Volt, but I cheated and opened it up. Only 9 Volt worth of batteries in it. This company falsly advertised this product as an 18 Volt drill, when I tried to send it back I couldn't get in touch with anyone. If I weren't in Afghanistan, I'd sue somebody. What a rip-off!
a con!: So called 18v drill turned out to have only 7.2v of batteries, a 7.2v motor and charger. Box and drill are labelled 18v but be warned all you will get is a 7.2v drill ie useless.
Okay but not great: I purchased the Boston Cordless Drill about 2 years ago and I can say I probably used it 4 times, the drill does not power fully and I have to keep charging the drill every few minutes which is a pain in th @ss. I didnt pay alot for it so I am not upset just a little frustrated when I need to do my projects around the house.
A great travel bag!: I purchased this bag about a year ago and have taken it on many trips since. The bag has lots of space without being too bulky, and the multiple compartments make it easy to keep your stuff organized and secure on the go.
The Only Way to Eat for the Rest of your Life: 'Fat is not your Fate' is an excellent book dealing with the many obstacles associated with weight loss. It helps you recognize your own body through tests that categorize your body type and then teaches your how to eat accordingly for the rest of your life. This is the only book you will ever need to read for eating correctly and maintainly a lean and healthy body. These authors are PhD. professionals in their field who have spent years studying and doing researach in preparation for this book.
Discover the real secrets of advertising: If you aspire to a career in advertising, marketing or whatever niche in communications you have selected: this is a MUST read. Or as David Ogilvy once remarked: "You must read it 7 times!
Too many typos. Find a better version.: I was incredibly excited to finally get a copy of this book, and started reading it as soon as it arrived.The problem I have with this book is not in content, but in spelling... There are SO MANY misspelled words.The publisher is someone called Really Simple Media and supposedly has reprinted the original book exactly as it was by Mr Hopkins. To me, it appears they scanned the original work and did OCR, because some words don't even make sense in the sentence.The current publisher of this book must have changed something. I find it unbelievable that a person in the ad business would so carelessly edit a work with his own name on the cover, and even more unbelievable that generations of advertisers would recommend this book to their colleagues.There are other reviewers who make the same observation in their reviews.
Great Ideas and a Joy to Read: I found this book to be very informative and was worth the time and money. I found many ideas which will allow me to continually improve upon my electronic and print marketing campaigns.Others have said that the book is written horribly and the publishers should be embarrassed - I disagree. Granted, there are a few grammar errors - but the book is written in early 20th century and much of the language, speech and mannerisms of the time come through in the writing. I found this style entertaining and easy to read.The book also refers to many of the social norms of this era such as discussing only "men" in business. If there happened to be a successful business-women - she was only able to accomplish this with the help of men. Again, I think does not take away from the content of the book, rather augments the principles since they are time honored and are able to survive the tests of time.
Best of the Best!!: This book change our perspective about our business strategies. If you are serious about making profits in your business you need to read this book.
Why the editors of this edition are illiterate...: Scientific advertising is a wonderful book and Claude Hopkins is a genius. He lays down the basis for direct mail advertising. His text is clear, insightful and still applicable in the Internet age...That said, I would advise people NOT to buy this edition of the book.It's full of typos, spelling errors and incomplete sentences. The publishers (really simple media) are obviously just a bunch of amateurs taking advantage of the fact that this masterpiece is in the public domain.Spend your hard-earned cash on a decent used copy of Scientific Advertising instead of buying this unprofessional edition....
Outstanding work. But publisher should be ashamed.: This is a classic book that is a must-have for anyone in advertising and marketing. However, the publisher Really Simple Media should be ashamed of their lack of proper editing for grammatical and spelling errors. It is full of these. It is truly one of the worst editing jobs I have ever seen from a publisher (if one could call them that).
gay gay gay!!!!!!!!!: im sick and tired of these p99s.they r a big copy off of the p22.the p22 is waaaaay better,first of all it comes with 2 clips a feeder, and is way more accurathde
Total rip-off: You would think when ordering a CO2 powered air gun that the gun would accept a CO2 cartridge, right? This gun does not accept CO2 cartridges. It came with no instructions, no schematics, no receipt...just an ornamental gun in a box.If this is what the manufacturer considers an air gun then you should avoid this manufacturer. This useless gun is going back!
Ick.: Well, this was a real disappointment.What we have here is a cd that is mostly a gentleman reading a fair-quality essay about Lenny Bruce, interspersed with some recordings of Lenny and recordings of interviews with others about Lenny.The recordings are all OBVIOUSLY taken from old vinyl records, with lots of scratches. That's right, that means that there is no new material to be found here. I also wonder if all the rights for these recordings were arranged.The brief Lenny snippets don't often even go with the essay being read, and the whole pile of slop has some attempted important-sounding synth music added in.It is not a fun listen. I do not recommend it, except for completists.
Previous reviewer had skewed expectations: This CD is obviously billed as a biography. One look at, I don't know, anywhere on the jacket would clue you in. The first reviewer was looking for a comedy album and didn't find it and so of course he was disappointed. However, as a biography goes this was concise and well thought out with many excerpts from interviews with friends and family, and excerpts from Bruce's performances as well. The narration can be bit muggy at parts and they don't always identify who is talking, but overall it is a speedy and easy way to get to know the life of Lenny Bruce with some comedy mixed in as well.
I had to read this for history too: ...and I loved it! Kerbouchard is an awesome hero, and I really liked the way the book was written. I too am disappointed that there is no sequel. You should read this book!
A great book no matter how many times you read it!!: I've been a Louis L'Amour fan for as long as I can remember having favorite authors. The Walking Drum, although it isn't a western, is vintage L'Amour. His attention to character developement, historical and geographical accuracy, and good old fashioned story telling makes this one of the best novels he's ever written. Anyone interested in suspense, adventure, romance, and wit will have a great time with this book!!
I'm trapped in an adventure novel and I can't get out!: I'm actually a fan of Louis L'Amour and his westerns, so I was pretty excited about the idea of him writing a medieval adventure novel. However, I was very disappointed with "The Walking Drum". The book is basically a series of repetitive adventures involving Kerbouchard (another of L'Amour's supermen)getting into trouble and getting back out again. Repeat, ad finitum. The only thing that seems to change is the backdrop. That L'Amour knew the places and histories he was writing about firsthand is obvious. He was always good at making the settings of his books very vivid and living parts of his books. But the actual structure of the novel's plot -- well, here it's just a hodgepodge. By the time Kerbouchard rescued his father I just wanted to get the darn book finished already. Definitely not one of his best.
Best historical fiction ever!: I had to read this book my sophomore year in high school. I am so glad my teacher assigned this! It is very well-written. You truly feel as though you are actually experiencing everything in the book. I found it to be very accurate and very rich in detail. I wish the author had been able to write a sequel.
Very enjoyable reading: I love adventure stories, and this is a good one. I did not understand all the historical background but enjoyed the book anyway. L'Amour knows his westerns, but he definitely did a lot of research to write this book as well. I've also read Last of the Breed which is excellent.In the "Author's Note" at the end of the book, which was written in 1984, L'Amour notes that in school we are taught little of China, India and the Moslem world, but "they are now powers with which we must deal both today and tomorrow, and which it would be well for us to understand." He called that one right.
a book set in a great time peroid....: ...but not a good story. I don't want to sound like at 11-and-a-half year old person that wrote a review to Emma or whatever, but the peroid this book was set in, is a great time. It had all of the makings of a good book, but it was just too slow for my liking. If you like high paced books set in the Middle Ages, this book has some moments like that, but not enough.
too long: walking drum is way too long, i mean i had to read it for required reading for my school and it was painful how long it took... kind of predictable and cliched too, which didn't help it's cause....
I was made to read this book for history class: this book in my opinion is simply horrid. i usually adore reading, and have probably thousands of books in my home. If action and romance are all you want, then this book can supply short intervals of that. If you are more of a person who treasures symbolism and learning about human nature, then this book will utterly bore you.
James Bond in the 12th Century: I just finished "The Walking Drum" - I have been reading all the L'Amour books I can find, and this one disappointed me.I enjoyed the change of scenery from the typical L'Amour' American West setting to one in far off Asia, but found the book to be too cliched and and the plot simply unbelievable. The hero is just too handsome and heroic, and the events too full of convenient coincidences, busty babes and wondrous escapes.I felt that L'Amour wrote this book as a pot boiler to earn cash rather than as serious work of historical fiction. If you really want an engrossing read, try Bernard Cornwell's "The Archer's Tale" trilogy, which takes place a couple of centuries later.
A complicated epic: There is many different places and characters that the main character encounters on his journey. Most of them have long and unpronounceable names. I recommend if you read this book to keep a pad of sticky notes and write down important characters and places in the book. This book is a very informational book that captures your magination and keeps you yearning to read more.
Great Writng and Awful Writing What a Surprise!: Great historical backdrop, great adventure writing. Enough intrigue for 10 books (if disjointed).Unfortunately, the main charactar spends half of the book talking about how great he is and how his greatness affects his view of the world for about half of the book. It seems like way more than half. If the dreadful monolog were deleted, it would be a normal-length book.Surprisingly, the women charactars are all unbeleivable and hard to respect.As always, Louis L'amour is a spectacular writer. He could really have been helped by a good editor on this one.Unique, Delightful, Infuriating, Disappointing, Exciting, Tedious
AN AMAZING INSIGHT INTO OUR PAST.: IT WOULD TAKE YEARS OF RESEARCH TO COMPILE THE HISTORY IN THIS BOOK. THE MAIN CHARACTER IS A LIKABLE GUIDE THROUGH THIS PERIOD IN HISTORY AND A GREAT READ.
Great book to read and listen to!!!!!: This is just one of the many books that Louis L'amour has written, this is not a dramatized version it is just n actor reading the book word for word, to me thats the best way to listen to one.... this is a must buy novel.
IF REPETION IS THE LAW OF ABIDING IMPRESSIONS, THEN....: I love Louis L'amour westerns and I had great hopes that this non-western "WALKING DRUM" would equal the excellence of his westerns--and it did for several chapters. After awhile, however, the book became so repetitive that you could anticipate what would happen next. I gave the book 2 stars only because it did keep my interest for a few chapters.
Wonderful story filled with subtle philosophy. Incredible!!: I have been an avid reader of L'amour's Westerns and, aside from Sackett's Land (which isn't completely non-western), I had never read any of his non-western titles until I read this. Louis L'amour did a fantastic job on The Walking Drum with so many intricate plots working at once with the coming of age of Mat Kerbouchard, his never-ending quest for his father, all the side romance plots, not to mention his yearning for learning. No type of story-telling is forgotten. A masterful work indeed!
Not Typical of the Author: Hey don't get me wrong he's a great author but if you read one of his westerns you have read them all.Not so with this book it is an above average old fashioned swashbuckler adventure. Just fantastically good stuff if you like Historical Fiction.
A masterpiece!!: I'm on my third read of this book. This book has a touch of everything ... great humour, philosophy, accurate history, romance, bravery. It's probably L'Amour's best novel. It was his first book I read, and it left such a sweet taste in me that I haven't really enjoyed any of his other books. I would recommend it to anyone, young or old. I read it for the first time after high school, and I'm reading it for the third time several years after college.I'm inspired by Kerbouchard -- brave warrior, philosopher, scholar, lover -- as skilled with his sword as he is with his mind and his tongue.I was a bit disappointed by the ending though -- the build-up and anticipation was so great that I don't think the ending did enough justice to the whole novel.
The only book i have read more than once.: An amazing story filled with adventure, Its just a shame the other 2 books were never written. I have read this book 8 times now, and its still an awesome mental journey. READ IT!
Do NOT read if you have anything to do for thenext 12 hours.: One word to sum up this book. Addictive. Totally, completely, amazingly addictive. I was up till 1:00 am because I HAD TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED NEXT! It just gets better with each reading. The period detail is fantastic. History teachers could certainly pick worse assignments although be warned, you may stand up your prom date because as stated before this book is impossible to put down!Read it if you love any of the following:History cool characters Love Swashbuckling Funny dialogue Fiendish villains (The guy at the end gets the prize as nastiest villain of ALL TIME)Read it, you will never regret it although your prom date might.
One of three books to profoundly influence my life: I was given this book for my twelveth birthday, and since then I have read it at least once a year. As a history major, I love to find books that reflect the truth of history in a beautiful and realistic way. Kerbouchard is a truly renaissance man who is on a quest to find his father, who may or may not be dead. In this quest, he travels mideval Europe, from the Christian lands of France to the Muslim lands of Spain and East to the steeps of Russia. What amazed me when I read this was that the middle ages were only the dark ages for western Europe; the Muslim lands were bright and alive and unoppressive. Kerbouchard's philosophy in life of learning for learning's sake is one I have adopted in my own travels through life.
The best Louis L'amour: The Walking Drum is an instant classic.Having read the book many times at different ages from a teenager to an adult. I have found it to be full of life, passion and adventure. This book makes you want to see the places in Spain and go to the library in Cordoba, to see the statue at Cadiz. You actually want to read and learn about great things, to become a scholar, or in our day a professor or an author.Louis L'amour brings you into the time and carries you on this adventure making you not want to put down the book.It's Just a great Book.
A FUN historic-fiction: My father read this book to my sister and I when I was about ten, so naturally I have a lot of sentimental attachment to the romantic hero, Mathurin Kerbouchard, and his quest. The book also sparked an interest in medieval European and imperial Arab history, before I even entered high school. I re-read this book every-so-often, and find Kebouchard's adventures don't get tiresome with repetition.
Not L'Amour's best: Because of all the good reviews this book had, I bought and read it. Disappointed. L'Amour's heroes are always bigger than life, but this one is excessively so. However, I did read it almost straight through.I would probably have bought a sequel if one ever came out. His best book was "Last of the Breed."
One Great Book: Louis is one of my favorite writers and I have read all his books many times over. The Walking Drum just happens to be my favorite book of his. His attention to detail and the research done for this particular book is amazing. This book grabs hold of the adventurous heart of the reader and refuses to let loose til the very end leaving you wanting more. Jeremy Saxton, Author of 'Just Loving Them'.
Great Read!: Louis L'Amour is a wonderful story teller. His historical research adds detail and validity to the story. I hated for it to end! I highly recommend this wonderful saga!
Excellent reading!: These lite-mystery series books are a delightful change of pace from the usual books I read. This book moved along swiftly with just the right balance of intrigue and humor. I really enjoyed this story, felt sorry for Desiree, and did not figure out the crime until the solution was revealed!
Reader might be fine but avoid HomeAgain: We just bought a dog that had been chipped. All I can tell you is that I registered the chip with HomeAgain. Then I got an email telling me that I need to register my dog. It had the right email (came to me), had the right name for the dog but a completely different chip number. I contacted HomeAgain and the customer service person didn't seem surprised or overly concerned. I called the pet store where I bought the dog. The owner talked to the owner of HomeAgain and was assured that it was just a 'glitch' and it had been corrected.Folks, tying your pets microchip number to you is the only reason for their existence. If they can't do that, they are useless.The chips are probably fine but their software is apparently buggy and can't be trusted. When our puppy is neutered, we will have this chip removed and an AVID chip implanted.If I could give this product a 0 star rating, I would.
WARNING! Don't buy this until you know what you're getting.: If you pay and download this item, you will quickly find out that it is not a 17836 word article, but a 4040 word article. Perhaps it's still worth the price, but we should be correctly informed. I have emailed customer service about the incorrect information.
Cool cap: Really nice and specially hard to find in stores. Excellent shape, great look and a really good price... You got a big brand behind it so,there's no way to be disappointed.
AS dictionary for serious students: Easy to read, but codes must be looked up constantly in the front of the book. The ubiquitous ge- is dropped, so only the root is given, indented slightly. Well-constructed paperback.
Love 'Em: My coach first got me into these when I began running in high school. Ever since I have loved them. I eat a Clif Bar a day and these are my favorite! They are chewy and chocolately and packed with a lot of vitamins and minerals. Great before a workout or for an afternoon energy boost.
Eat one everyday.: I eat a Clif Bar everyday before I go to work. And I work the night shift, and I'm constantly on the move, so I need some quick energy. Clif Bars deliver what they promise. As a meal replacement, they work great. I don't feel hungry for hours, and I've got the energy I need to keep going.
Light reading and wonderful adventure: Enid Blyton introduces us the first adventure of the awesome Five in this book. The Five serie is about four teenagers and their dog who encounter adventures everywhere they go. It is the ultimate teen fantasy because these guys are on their own under the permission of their parents, traveling through England on their summer vacations, staying in cool places (such as castles, mansions, farms, open country, deserted islands, etc.) while defeating bandits and thiefs. The personalities of each character are very defined and the guest characters are equally awesome. It is a great light reading and an encouraging book to make children and teenagers read.
Tresure Island Review: In my opinion, I think that it was a very poor book. I did not think that it got to details clearly, I thought that they jumped around alot. I got the feeling that it was leaving out parts, and nto getting directly to the point. I guess that I am just used to reading love stories, and not adventure stories.I love to read, but when I was reading this, I was not interested, and my mind wondered instead of actually getting into the book. I just thought that it was written poor, and not exactly thought about clearly. That is just my opinion though, I did not like Treasure Island, I thought that it was very uninteresting. That is just my opinion though, no one has to listen to it.
Treasure Island: Reviewer an 11 year old boy.A 4 star book. This is a book about the high seas. The author is Robert Louis Stevstonson. There are a lot of characters including Long John Silver, Black Dog, Billy Bones, Jim Hawkins, Squire Trenly, and Dr. Livesey.Black Dog and Billy Bones get into a fight. They have names for the sails on the boat such as flying jib ,jib, fore sail, fore top sail, main top sail,and mainsail. I think this book was good.
Staying in Touch: Jan's Rainbow: Stories of Hope: How Those We Have Loved and Lost Stay In Touch has been an inspiration for me and has helped me in my grief. I am thankful to Lindsay for writing this book and also for including my story of how my husband stays in touch with me. I have given this book to other people who are suffering from the loss of their soulmate. We need stories of hope to help us through this journey.
Beautiful Memorial: I know Lindsay from our work in the consulting field and met his wife briefly. Lindsay did everything possible for his wife during her illness to make her last days meaningful and comfortable. Reading this book reminded me of how much he loved her and how much she is missed. The stories are heartrending. It is a beautiful memorial that Lindsay created for his wife. Everyone who has lost a special person should read this book.
Our Loved Ones are Still with Us: The signs that our loved ones send us just reinforce that they are still around us. Although their physical bodies are gone, their spirit lives on.
Not as good as expected: this book was recommended by the facilitator of our bereavement group and I thought the author's experiences and advise was pretty good but the stories he included from other people (about 3/4 of the book) were a little far fetched, unrealistic and poorly written; there are many other books out there that are much better and helpful
The original classic.: There is nothing bad to say about these movies. Nothing. This series is the very pinnacle of its time. Special effects, plot, story, execution, all top of the charts for the era.Has anyone ever NOT seen this series? If you haven't, it is definitely worth the time. One of the best series ever made.
Thoroughly enjoyable: I really enjoyed this trilogy. It has just the right amount of satire and suspense. I am only sad that they have not brought out the miniseries on DVD.
Husband's Christmas gift, loved it.: Nice blu ray and packaging. My husband is a huge Robocop fan and he loved it. It arrived very quickly, too.
Good interviews: Me and my buddies loved these movies growing up... with the exception of RoboCop 3. Still, even that movie provides great unintentional comedy. GReat enhancement and special features with the Blu-Ray technology
Don't waste your money: My wife picked up the first episode at Costco on a coupon (not the trilogy) and she even complained how bad this looked. Her question to me was, "I thought Blu-Ray was supposed to be a spectacular image?". I replied, they obviously did not remaster since the Laser Disc. Now I read the Trilogy just packaged the three movies without re-mastering DVD. I think the Laser Disc looked better (I don't have the DVD). This is an example of how not to release a movie on Blu-Ray.After this fiasco I was concerned when I ordered Cocoon & Star Man Blu-Ray editions, but they did remaster them for Hi-Def and did a good job. I am reluctant purchasing older movies however after this experience. I plan to give my copy away, since there is no reason to watch it again.
Peter Weller + Robocop = Freaking Awesome Movies: What more can you say, than Aside from Terminator, Robocop is another Badass to the Action Movie scene. Peter Weller Never lets you down as Alex Murphy, he totally nails the character and Now Icon that is Robo. Laugh and cheer on his performances as the metallic Cop from OCP in the crisp and excellent quality of Blu Ray. This Trilogy is worth the price even if Robocop Part 3 was a let down.
Beware!: Hi!,i did purchase the first movie on BR some months ago. The reviewers said the quality of the conversion was bad, i also have some "olds" movies like Predator, wich also have bad quality reviews, but the quality seams ok to me, certainly isnt Transformers o IronMan quality.However, the quality of Robocop is terrible, ist worst than my "old" DVD, or even air TV, i say: DONT BUY IT!!, so, be carefull with this one, and wait till it is released for rent. The only good thing, the BR has some new scenes on the movie...
Step aside terminator: The Robocop movies are the best sci fi movie out there. the first 2 (espicly 2) had lots (and i mean lots, its like skulls getting cut open and limbs shot off entirly) of blood and gore. now i do remember being a kid and watching the 3rd and after that i checked out the second then the first and man the 3rd dosent compair to the first 2. but my favroite Robocop movie has to be number 2 cuse of how dirty and gory it was. Frank Miller really needs to get a Directers Cut of number 2 out there cuse as i understand alot was cut from that movie it just nees more cuse it leaves you wantin more but in a good way. these movies are classics and will never die out and frankly the terminator just keeps getting worse as the movies progress.
Trilogy blu Ray: They are what u expect out of 3 films...one being very popular and the last 2 being mediocre...sound I'd awesome on all 3 but picture quality is only improved on the first while the other 2 are slightly...if your a big fan, go ahead and get them for the low price...if you'd being introduced to the series, then find the MGM trilogy on DVD that was released 5or6 years ago...price is probably lower and quality is pretty close to these.
Robocop Trilogy: The second disc, Robocop 2 was defective and would not play at all, so I am giving this set 2 stars.For MGM to release this with a known defective disc is inexcusable.
A must have collection: So happy that it was released in DVD. I could finally donate my VHS tapes . Great quality and sound .
Part Man / Part Machine / All COP: Robocop was a breakthrough smash hit when it first came out in the 1980's. Now that the movie comes out in Blu Ray...look forward to it
RoboCop Trilogy: Actually, I ordered this item for my adult son. He is very happy to have it. He has enjoyed these movies greatly.
SAVE your money....same Robocop as previously issued....: so you can buy it for under ten bucks anywhere (and we all know it not only is a bad transfer but has NONE of the great bonus features available on the normal DVDs)..so all you get for your huge investment is a bare bones 2 and 3...I can't believe I got suckered into buying this but I couldn't imagine them doing this at that price...fool me once...well I'll wait in the future until some other person does the experimenting.
Be Aware, No Extras: Well I have to say, I'm a huge RoboCop fan and I was excited to get this on Blu-Ray. I didn't find any extras on the case, so I thought it would be on the BR itself, But no dice. The DVD has more Xtras than the Blu-Ray. The 2nd and 3rd have only a trailer and being a being a huge Robocop fan,I was hoping they would have a lost featurette or new Commentaries. I was disappointed in this purchase and I wouldn't recommend this, I'd suggest to pick up the first single disc of the first movie. Oh well, Live and Learn. I'm keeping this though since I already bought it.
The ROBOBOX version is LAME.: Amazon is confusing, they put the SAME reviews for two DIFFERENT DVD Boxsets. Make sure you DO NOT get the ROBOBOX and are looking at the Robocop MGM Trilogy. The great version of the Robocop collection is the MGM version with Robocop 1 UNCUT. The Robocop 1 in the ROBOBOX collection is EDITED! I was mislead by all the positive reviews so I ended up getting the lame Robobox which simply just has the movies, no extras, and a butchered/edited masterpiece (yep, there are a couple minutes missing from Robocop). Avoid the blue Robobox, it's not the same DVD set everyone here is praising, it's DIFFERENT, not the definitive version of these classic movies. I wish somebody made that clear before I made a big mistake.
Its Robocop!: Its Robocop, who doesnt like them, evreyone should just have them. So go buy it ! lol It even has an extended version of the first movie.
better wait if you want the right box set: The back cover of this box set says 1st disk is AVC 21Mbps but it turns out the MPEG2 version when I checked it with blu-ray ROM drive and some softwares, which means 1st one is old version. It should be a misprint or something. If you already have 1st movie or expect better transfer for 1st movie, don't waste your money and better wait until the right boxset comes out or individual title is available if you're interested in 2nd and 3rd one.-- below updated Feb 28th, 2011Now I found 2nd one and 3rd one is available. One of my friends got each one at Bestbuy last week when they were on sale for $9.99 each.
Excelent product...: This is an awesome boxset (BR), I recommend everyone to buy it... Este es un gran boxset (BR), Se lo recomiendo a todos para que lo compren.
Great product delivered as promised: Vendor delivered as promised. This classic was a great find and buy. Thank you and highly recommended to do business A++++++
Poor presentation for the "Robocop" films is truly inexcusable--image quality mediocre at best and no special features: The Blu-ray release of the "Robocop Trilogy" on Blu-ray is disappointing; while the films look marginally better with slightly improved sharpness, the older HD master is riddled with edge enhancement artifacts and suffers softness. The second and third films look a bit better than the original film but, again, it's a marginal improvement over all.Audio is decent sounding although dialogue can get lost with the first film and that could easily have been remedied during the transfer stage.There are no special features which is inexcusable given that there were special features that could have been licensed from Criterion's edition for the first film or even ported over from the DVD boxed set.Over all the presentation of all three films is careless and sloppy.I'd wait to see if this is reissued again unless you can get it for very little money.
Anamorphic sequels....finally!: What I find disturbing on Amazon.com and most other DVD sites is the lack of information about a release's format. All three ROBOCOP films are finally in Anamorphic Widescreen and Dolby Digital 5.1. This is the first time Robo 2 and 3 get anamorphic releases, so for me, this alone was worth the cost, since I already owned the definitive Criterion Robocop. This is a slightly better release, however, in that it has some featurettes and trailers. It's great to finally watch Robo 2 (and the slightly sillier Robo 3) in Anamorphic Widescreen on my 65" HDTV, and in DD 5.1! While Robo 1 is still the best of the three, by far, don't discount Robo 2 and 3 for they have their moments too.
Great movies - zero Remastering: I swear that some guy in his basement with a DVD copy of Robocop ran DVDDecrypter, a blu-Ray burner, and burned it. Buy the DVD set. If you want to see something on blu-Ray in the Sci-Fi genre, forget MGM and get a good Universal Pictures movie or series. The original Star Trek series remastered on Blu-Ray jumps out of the screen in vibrant colors and hyper-realism.
Dont Buy!!!: I sadly enough bought this set because I am a fan of the movies. However when i received it i found that sadly the video quality is exactly the same as the dvd's and there are no special features at all. buy the dvd's not the bluray since its not worth the high price.
Don`t waste your money: this boxset is absolutly unnecesary.the movies audio and video are ok, but they don't have any extras, just the trailers and that`s it.I don`t understand why the studio edit such a piece of crap. The dvd edition is so MUCH better.Shame on you MGM.
Juss cant get into it...: Young jeezy's "The inspiration" has no inspiration... Like his album before this one ? "thug mov" & "trap or die" or wuteva tha f*ck he called it? It falls flat and he just wants to be big and make alot of money, and be on mtv or b.e.t. All day long, just like 50/g unit along wid other wack rappers. Two starts simply cause the song "dreamin" is actullie good but the rest of the album is garbage.
This is the beginning: I know how to weld, cut metal, design and tune suspensions from scratch adapt junk to something useful, the list of things I can do seems endless sometimes. Before I got this book I could do none of these things THIS is the book that gave me the bug that bit me and inspired me to learn to do all these things and to search for knowledge online, in books etc. It all began with this book. This book has forced me to take back all my sarcastic cynical remarks about actually building your own car when my wife bought this book for me. It is not a perfect book If it was I wouldnt have learned half of what I do now about suspensions etc since ford cortinas are not sold here But that is part of this books charm its hook is in getting you off your back side and into the pursuit of your own personal sports car. Its been a fantastic ride and I hope you buy a copy too
POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE: RECIEVED THE RACK IN SEVERAL DAYS, BOX IN TERRIBLE CONDITION FROM AGE, ALL THE PARTS INSIDE THE BOX WERE NOT WRAPPED FOR PROTECTION, SCRATCHS ON SEVERAL PARTS, SEVERAL SCREWS AND SCREW COVERS WERE MISSING, CALLED FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE TWICE. NEVER RECIEVED A RETURN PHONE CALL TO RESOLVE THIS.HAD TO BUY PARTS AT THE HARDWARE STORE TO COMPLETE THE INSTALLATION
Get something sturdier!: The bottle is made of a safe plastic, but it feels really cheap. The nozzle is also pretty stiff, so you have to really tug at it sometimes. The cage is pretty thin steel, so it bends at the slightest touch. I didn't have many problems with the bottle falling out, but the plastic tab that holds the bottle down starts wiggling around right after you start using it. It lasted about a year (I didn't use my bike that frequently) before the thin wire cage snapped off of it's base. It's probably worth investing is something a little more expensive and a lot more sturdy.
Champion knee brace did the job.: I used this knee brace on my recent back packing trip to Colorado. I worked very well in keeping my knee streight and not alowing the joint to moved side to side.
Good product but doesn't stay on: This is very well made and I suppose would work well if it stayed up. If you have large thighs, it will not. It rolls down. I would like to add that it is pretty true to size, if anything maybe a little on the larger side and not smaller. I wish it would have worked for me, because it is well made for the money. It's just going to sit here and not be used:( Shipping was quick too! This is not the companys fault, if your a larger person, these things happen.
Did then job when nothing else would: Back when I ordered this, I had sprained my knee pretty badly. I needed to stabilise it to see if it'd heal on its own, or whether I'd need a doctor. There was nothing at the pharmacy that fit. This product was comfortable, sturdy, and easy to use and to keep clean. I would say that at the time I was right in the middle of the range of fit for it - 5'10", 340 lbs, mostly on thighs and hips.Postscript - the knee healed nicely, and I no longer weigh anything NEAR 340+ lbs. I included my then-weight in order to be helpful to others in deciding whether this product might fit. Truth of the matter, if this hadn't done its job, I might not have healed as well, and might not have been able to drop the weight.
Great product: Only problem I have is over use. I've been having some knee pain after twisting my knee. Have used this for plane rides, long meetings where sitting too long. This helps you from putting your leg / knee into a position that will hurt. Really helped improve. When I wear it too long - 6+ hours, the straps sometimes slide down into my knee. Just need to keep tightening, or wear it a little shorter length. Would definitely buy again.
Not enough information: Actually I give this book zero stars. It is one of those books that pads the pocket of the author but is stingy with the information it gives. It is too general and does not really deal with problem solving the technicalities involved with taking slides of your own art. I wanted to know on which side of a slide to place a mask. The book failed to give this important piece of information. I found that I had already bought a more comprehensive book, so I feel that I wasted my money buying this book.
Outdated, bad advice, useless: The author recommend using halogen work lamps that produce extremely uneven lighting with a stripe of strong horizontal light right in the middle of the works photographed. Even if using 4 of these lamps, there is no way to get even lighting on the works.Also the digital photography discussed is totally outdated and useless.The Quick & Easy Guide to Photographing Your Artwork
Thinking about buying this book? Don't.: This book has good illustrations and diagrams, but is out of date. With only a brief section on digital photography this book looks older thatn its published date of 2003.
Not useful if you're using a digital camera: This review was written by Cigdem Gokce. This book was written with good intentions, as can be understood from the simple and clear illustrations used to explain many aspects of photographing art work and the various examples of faulty photography. However, for digital camera users it is virtually useless for anything beyond setting up the correct lighting conditions since digital photography ise mentioned almost as an afterthought, with the bulk of the book dedicated to extensive elaboration of the merits and uses of photography film. As such, it can only be of help to those artists who still prefer to use (and manage to find) analog photography machines and films. I read this book on North Light e book archives and was glad that I didn't buy it. It's a shame that no effort was made to bring it up-to-date before publishing in 2003.
Very Disappointed-Review for Grady's, not the lantern: I placed an order with this company for Black lanterns on 10/26/2011 expecting to receive in 3-5 business days - in time for a party next week. They contacted me on 10/28/11 (2 days after my order) to say they could only send me green lanterns - I need black as ordered! I explain I need black and I need them on-time. They tell me they're sorry for the inconvenience and that if I don't want green then they will cancel my order. GREAT, now I don't have time to order new ones and guarantee them on time with another company - thanks a lot Grady's Online!!!!
You get what you pay for: Cheap product = Cheap Price!You cannot replace the wick, once the one that is in there has been removed, the mechanism will not take another one no matter how you try to load it.If you are looking for a short-term use then this would be a fine product. 2 stars because its pretty much disposable.I used Citronella Oil in them and it burns fine.
MIAMI LONG SLEEVE SHIRT: THIS SHIRT SURE HELPS WITH THE PAIN OF THE FINS NOT MAKING IT VERY FAR LAST YEAR. THE SHIRT IS GREAT. ART WORK FADED A LITTLE BUT IT IS WELL LOVED.
Tinkerbell is on tough fairy: I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product. These matts seem tough. They are nice and thick, seem well made and are very cute. I bought them as a gift for my granddaughter and she seemed very pleased with them. We will have to see how they stand up to her torture.
Solid selection at budget price: An eclectic and well-performed collection of modern European (mostly Italian) music. The Sciarrino piece (Introduction to the Obscure) is not one of his strongest recorded works, but the Berio (Differences) and Xenakis (Waarg) are excellent. Could serve as a useful introduction to any of the composers except Bussotti, whose short "Nascolto" is a homage to Boulez. Timing is rather skimpy at 43 minutes.
Did not work for use made itching worse: I bought this thinking it would help out the multiple hotspots that developed my my pup's feet after she had a really bad seasonal allergy attack, well it turns out it made thing A LOT worse. She actually started to lick and chew even more and instead of helping with the itch it made her more itchy, which i then realize she probably is allergic to the spray as well! so this is a no go for me. I would like to see the wording on the label changed to to encompass all types of skin itchyness....
Smells bad and didn't work for my cat: I got this for my cat because she has skin allergies and had one specific area where she was picking. I could not get this to work for her because it smelled so bad and she licked it right off. It might work for dogs but I wouldn't recommend a spray like this for cats.
Ineffective: I used Frontline and my dog still had fleas, so I bought this thinking it would take care of what the other product didn't kill. Unfortunately that was not the case. I sprayed it directly on a flea on the bed even and it didn't even react. The smell isn't bad, and the price isn't bad, so I'm glad there's that at least, but otherwise a total waste of money.
Excellent!: Not only has this kept my itchy little dog from chewing the fur off his toes, I used this on a severely allergic rescue dog, whose entire body was covered in bright red, hot rashes, and within a day his rash went down by half. I will continue to buy this product and recommend it to others. I've even used this on myself, and it feels amazing - stops maddening itches nearly instantly!I read one review that said their dog got very sick from licking this off, and that tea tree oil is toxic to dogs. While I have read that it can be, I'm pretty sure it's only in certain quantities that it becomes toxic, although obviously some dogs are more sensitive than others. I bathe my dogs in shampoo with tea tree and use Earthbath Tea Tree spray-on conditioner and have never had a problem, and have also never had a problem with a Vet's Best product.Just my 2c!
This stuff works! And it smells good, too.: Our dog's belly was bald because of his excessive licking to calm the itching caused by an allergy to the grass he loves to lie on. After just a few days of regular sparying with the Hot Spot Itch Relief Spray, the hair started to grow again. I think he's made the connection, because he doesn't run away when he sees the bottle in my hand....just stands still so I can spray.
**DANGER!!!!!! WARNING FOR PETS!!!!!!!** This Product Contains Tea Tree Oil: External application of tea tree oil undiluted and/or at inappropriate high doses has been associated with toxicity, including death, in cats and other animals, due to ingestion during grooming.[...]
Not what I expected for Hot Spot relief......: I've been looking for an itch relief shampoo for my golden retriever, which I'm sure she's not the only breed that tend to get hot spots during the winter, but also the summer months. This product just did the opposite for her and now I'm back with my old shampoo "dermaplex". Guess it's going to take a few more shampooings in the next couple of weeks to get the sores healed from biting so much. Sometimes it doesn't pay to change shampoos...had dogs for over 30yrs and most where golden's. I don't recommend this product for dog's with sensitive skin...
Avoid: I purchased this so I could move my Wii to my second TV without moving all the cabling. As soon as I installed this component cable, I noticed artifacting in the image that was not occurring with the original Nintendo component cables. I was able to isolate the problem to the cables. I suggest everyone avoid them.
WII Component Video Cable: Better picture that the composite video. Seems to be a quality cable with good construction.Works just as described.
not fully white... only reason i bought em too. im returning them.: these cables have some kind of shielding over them that cannot be removed, and it is not full white, it has black stitching or something along the side. i got this cable because i thought it was all white, and i wanted it to be inconspicuous against my white wall. well, this breaks the deal for me. theyre going back. they shouldve included a picture of the whole thing and not just the connectors.
DO NOT PURCHASE FROM NUTRICITY: Not only did it take from June 21st to July 8th to receive the deodorant, it arrived in what appeared to be a used condition. The sanitary cover for the actual deodorant stick was removed. And the top rim of the applicator had many cracks and a few small pieces missing. Anyone stupid enough to attempt to use this deodorant stick (and catch some rare skin disease) could possibly cut themselves under their arms. I wonder if this could have been a returned item or just one someone tried out before sending it cross country. Considering it might be contaminated I threw it out not wanting to go through the time wasting hassle of returning this piece of garbage.
case study: This book is a case study book, meaning it is a book of personal stories. There is no advice given in the book at all beacause it is a case study. 8 of the 13 stories are wriiten from a betrayed wife whose husband had a child with another women. Hopefully this book will allow a book to get written that will contain advice from professional child councelors, pychologists and other professionals who deal with these children and the children of the marriage. This book is basically like reading many of the free mesaage boards that you can find on the internet.
case study book: This book is a case study book, in other words it is a collection of people's stories. 8 of the 13 stories are written from a betrayed wife whose husband had a child with another women. The book is good for what it is, a case study, but do not expect ANY advice because there is NONE. Hopefully this book will get attention and a book with advice from professional child councelors, psychologists, ect can get written. This book was very much like reading a message board found on the internet, personal feelings no professional advice.
A fascinating page-turner: "Beyond Peleliu" is a wonderful novel, rich in detail, with characters you really feel you know. It is not a typical "lawyer book." The story, which covers three generations, skillfully melds war, medicine, magic, and complex relationships with a dramatic courtroom story. Peter Baird is a great storyteller who kept me turning the pages as fast as I could. When I finished the book, I couldn't stop thinking about it.
Amazing story!: Being related to the author, one stunning aspect of this amazing story is that much of it is based upon true events. The details might seem pretty incredible, but the Battle of Peleliu and the many repercussions, both positive and 0, were very real and do live on to this day.
A great campaign setting, and a great book: This book is very good. I don't think that I've ever read a Role-Playing book from cover to cover, but 150 pages in and I haven't missed one. Usually I just skip around, especially in the description of the lands, but so far I have read everything about every country. This book is a must if you wanna play in a darker, different realm.
a disappointed ravenloft fan.: I'm crazy about ravenloft, but this item isn't so greatfor what I payed for it. If you liked Domains of Dread youprobably won't be crazy for this either. It just seems toexplain how you can get a gothic feel to your adventure everytime you play. It gives the history of the land and the population of every domain, but almost nothing about the darklords. Most of them aren't even named. While domains of dread gave each darklord a story and history, nothing is said ofthem in this text. The only thing I really liked about this text is that it hails the return of the lich king Azlain. We also find out who the new darklord of Sithicus is. If you are a ravenloft fan I'm sorry to say you will probably be dissapointed as well after waiting so long for this books release.
This was REALLY disappointing: I really expected more from White Wolf and the D&D line in general. For starters, the only "impressive" artwork I saw was on the cover and most of the other "art" sucked! The description of some of the lands were lacking in ANY kind of depth. Lord Soth is gone (which really bummed me out), the Character classes in Ravenloft details were non exsistent for some of the classes, the main villains and such (and I mean all of them) are suposed to com out in another book(?!?!). For the MSRP to be [what it is] there needs to be TONS more information. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars was because of the rules on the descent into darkness which in all honesty were pretty cool. Personally I think if you want to run Ravenloft you should find the old boxed set and convert it to 3e.
The most expensive way to receive faxes I know of.: Pros:Reasonably fastQuietNo jamsCons:Goes through ink at an astonishing rate and the tiny cartridges are $41.79 at the local office super store!I bought this fax for my home office. It receives relatively light use, so you can imagine my shock when my wife informed me we had just used up our 3rd $40+ cartridge! That's over $120!! Great machine... Wish I could afford it.
Disappointed: This machine worked great for a few months, but its ink dried out after I haven't used it for a couple of months, and I've only received/printed less than 50 pages total so far.I bought this equipment for only $80 from Costco, and I thought that I had a great deal at that time, but now it looks like I will be spending a lot more money on the ink cartridges than my laser printer!
bad bad bad: I bought one, and it had a repeated problem with a "Printer Error". It could be reset, but I would lose all my saved and unprinted faxes in the process. I returned it for a new one, and it had the same problem. After spending an hour on the phone with a very helpful service rep, she pronounced the machine broken, and advised me to take it for repair. Nope. Returned it and went back to my old machine that doesn't hold much paper and throws documents on the floor, but it does send and receive!
costly ink and low yield: I bought this machine in july 2003 for home use. After 4 months and about 50 pages of printed fax, the ink is gone.I contact Sharp regarding this problem but was told that the warranty is only for 15 days.Based on my experience, it is an expensive machine to keep because it is costing me 70 to 80 cents per fax page.
Never want to buy a Sharp!: This machine is just a piece of JUNK!Even when we put in a $35 new ink (we actually bought two), it keeps telling us "CHECK CARTRIDGE".Will shop for a replacement tomorrow, but will never buy a Sharp!
Piece of junk: I only use my fax for very light, occasional fax reception. Echo the very expensive inkjet costs. Additionally, mine is essentially unuseable in receive now as I either continually have to perform a cleaning operation or I get "check cartridge" error messages. Avoid this fax machine.
Significant drawbacks: This is an adequate fax. The paper feed has jammed twice for no apparent reason. Commands are a little awkward to execute and are not always intuitive. Footprint is compact, and the resend function works reasonably well. The major drawback is that it eats ink cartridges and the replacements are expensive. I receive a small volume of faxes, not more than ten pages a month, and usually less than that, but the cartridge runs dry after a few months. Per page costs are high. This is the third fax that I have owned, and the least economical. I would recommend buying another brand, based on on my experience.Also, while you may refill cartridges, I have had poor luck with that solution.
Don't even think about it!: If you make the same mistake I did and buy this machine, be prepared to change the ink constantly! It prints on average 112 pages a week and needs new ink every 7 days at $35.00 a pop. Needless to say, after owning it for one month it is going on the garbage heap.
Find Another Fax Machine: I bought this machine less than a year ago and am now having to replace it. It has started a Printer Error loop and can't clear the error without replacing the circuit board. Inexcusable for basic office machine puchased within the last year.
Save your money: This is the worst fax machine I have ever owned. I don't know what happens to the ink, but the ink cartridge doesn't last very long. Furthermore, the print quality is horrible when it does work. You will save money and headaches in the long buying any other fax machine.
Buy at Your Own risk!: It's stated that this is Sharp's "new" fax machine. Don't believe it - we've had this machine for years and it's a serious under-performer.You have to stand by the machine to make sure your fax actually goes through. Half the time, the machine stops during the process and you have to resend the fax. The other half of the time with incoming faxes, it bleeps, and you get a "line error" message, and no fax.Unreliable at best. There's better machines out there and we've just ordered Canon's L90 fax/phone.
One of My All-Time Favorites: This is one of my favorite books of all time. I consider it in the top one percent of all books I have ever read. The sheer scope of this work makes me almost gasp with incredulity and amazement. To think that one man could have accomplished this is mind boggling. This is the eighth wonder of the world. From prehistory and until the late 1980s, this book covers politics, economics, science, and arts. McNeill's generalizations are wonderfully and cogently supported by facts at just the right places in the narrative. To produce a handbook of this scope that is also so pleasant to read is an incomparable achievement.
Another slept on Ruffin album: I had already heard half the songs on this. I was not dissapointed when I heard the other half. It's hard to distinguish between a good album and a great album, because you have to consider other artists and records of the same time period, but I think this album is better than what it gets credit for. I think "All I Need" is the best song. There really isn't a bad song on this album. Like "So Soon We Change" LP this is defintely worth the price.
from Davids fan: This item was new to me in that i didn't that it was around and available so I was very excited to find it. David is excellent here as always with his singing. I was not familliar with any of the songs but there were several good ones on the disc. And as I said David is in excellent form as always. If you like David Ruffin at all you will like the disc, If you love him this is most definitely a must have for your collection. I highly recommend it.
Dickies - Girls' Flat Front Pants for less price: Dickies - Girls' Flat Front Pantsi found the same pants at walmart.com for $12 each. Why would i pay more in amazon.com?
Deja Vu: Not only has most of this material been published in other books, but most of it has been published in the previous books of the John Little series! John Little has to be the biggest Bruce Lee fanatic in the world. He probably knows more about Bruce Lee than Linda Lee does. That fact that he has to raise the price, make it a bigger hard back, and still reprint material from earlier in the series proves that he is just out for a quick buck! Bruce... we've been had. I am not going to return this book and inflict it on another poor soul, I'm going to burn it! John Little is a great author and really knows his stuff. It is just sickening that he feels comfortable putting his name on this absolute xerox of a book. Sorry John, I'm not buying any more.
Been there, Done that!: Most of the things in this book have been published in other books. I wish Bruce Lee was still alive so I wouldn't have to buy a book that is stale with Bruce's 1960's, hippie philosophy. I believe that Bruce would be spinning in his grave if he knew we were rehashing all his old material. I think the editors and Linda Lee should stop abusing the memory of Bruce Lee to make a quick buck. I will take my book back for a refund.
A true artist of life: This is an excllent collection of Bruce Lee's thoughts on art, martial art, acting, psychology & life in general. It captures the evolution & refinement of Bruce Lee's thought process from his Gung Fu days to his Jeet Kun do days.
A VERY INFORMATIVE BOOK: I've been in the martial arts game for over 30 years and have been a fan of Bruce Lee's since I was 15 years old and used to watch him on the old 'Green Hornet' series. I have always been fascinated by his approach to fighting, but now --after reading "Artist of Life" -- I have a much deeper respect for him as a human being. Talk about being a "complete" person; this book reveals Bruce Lee to be a Chinese martial art historian, a philosopher of both eastern and western thought, a poet of great depth and sensitivity, a martial art pioneer, and his essays on self-knowledge are absolutely compelling. Bruce Lee has revealed to me many areas of development that we all need to look at in order to become a "total" person. This is a great book, containing the words of a great martial artist -- and, more important, a great human being.
AWESOME!: "Bruce Lee: Artist of Life" contains a treasuretroveof wisdom that is applicable to everyone (not just martial artists)! Iwas absolutely amazed to read about Bruce Lee's insights into life, eastern and western philosophy and even his poetry! There is enough martial art material (most of it never published before!) to satisfy the most serious practitioner of Jeet Kune Do, but there is also a wealth of wonderful material on psychology, self-knowledge and art to make for wonderful reading for any member of the family. I am going to have to order a second copy to keep in good condition because I've already marked up my first copy with underlinings and notations. What a book! But then, with Bruce Lee, what an author!
Stay away from this series: Please stay away from this product. This video was developed by unprofessional so the lighting, the audio, video everything will be poor. No one know what the speaker is talking about.......... Its worth for less than 1 cent........
State of the art 1980s pop rock: Tommy James is one of the great under-rated geniuses of 1960s AM pop rock, and any release by him is worth listening to. This album is composed of nine songs all co-written by James and is very heavily influenced by the 1980s pop rock sound popularized by Starship, for example: heavy on the synthesizers and power guitar. James is not at the top of his craft here, but still, the album is enjoyable.
Immersive and addictive but ohh so great :): Those of you who play games to say you've finished it stay away from SWG. There is no end to this, and I love it. As a character you meet and become familiar with others. Going on hunts, gathering resources, and generally having fun. It's true that the grinding part of the game is arduous, but the rewards when you acheive master are great. It's a sad day whenever you have to drop skills you've worked on so you can learn another skill. Those who are most disappointed in the game are those who play merely to become jedi or those who wish to be Luke reincarnated.
Too bad SOE dosent care about its customers!: You would think that a company would take into consideration the thoughts of its players. Unfortunately, this is not the case with the designers of the Star Wars Galaxies team (SOE= Sony Online Entertainment). They will charge you for expansions and then turn around and remove 80% of the professions that you have spent months developing. They do this with NO warning and will not refund money. They do not support the needs and desires of the playing customers. If there were ever an example needed of what not to do with your online customers, SOE could write the book.
Buying Anything SW:G Related is a bad idea.: You might as well just throw your money in the toilet. Only the Star Wars name/franchise has been able to keep this game afloat for as long as it has been. With the latest changes, it will not last much longer.the SW:G Japan servers have already been shut down as of a few weeks ago. SW:G U.S. servers are well on their way.
CU Destroyed SWG: There has been a great disturbance in the Force, as though thousands of players cried out against the SWG "Combat Upgrade," and were silenced.Star Wars Galaxies used to be an extremely fun, engaging game. However, as of the end of April 2005, the game has completely changed. Just read some of the other reviews here talking about the so-called "Combat Upgrade." SOE is losing a lot of customers because they ruined Star Wars Galaxies. Now, it's just a cheap EverQuest 2 clone with Star Wars skins. If you want to play fun Star Wars games, try Knights of the Old Republic and Knights of the Old Republic 2.
swg d.o.a. of cu 4/26/05: cancelled ROTW expansion when CU hit.cancelled SWG days later.CU= death of SWG, and everyone knows it.WE WILL NOT PAY TO BETA TEST A PIECE OF S#$% GAME SOE.
There Is No Need For This: I cant believe that people are selling this for $30! Lets think, galaxies costs around 10-11 dollars a month. So in 2 months or the 60 day that the card gives you, without the card it costs 20-22$, but with the card its $30. I guess that 4 star wars trading game cards are worth 10 dollars!Please I simply want to open your eyes. Do Not Get This Card!!!
Far too many bugs and poor customer support: If you want to get into the Star Wars world I recomend Star Wars Republic Commando instead (GREAT gameplay, no monthly fees).In SWG, I got tired of running into bugs for most of the adventures/quests I decided to take. I would not recomend to pay for it. It seems to be a lot of new online games being released to play an old and buggy one.Player chat rooms and forums need to be moderated/filtered a lot to control upset clients from expresing their justified frustration.It could have been a VERY nice and fun online game (some people say it was, before changes SOE introduced some time ago)... but instead I find it now very buggy, poorly patched, poorly supported and full of inconsistecies.
Broken game - Worste ever: They made a trial and a tutorial that seems nice but the real game is 100% broken. Game is just about unplayable. The makers of the game, SOE and LA, say it will be months before it is playable. But they still charge you $15 a month to play an unplayable game.Check all the game review sites. They all say this is the worste MMORPG in the history of online games.
Star Wars Galaxies: The developers of this game have ruined it. They are constanly makeing terrible decisions that negativly affect the your gameplay. They choose not to fix major bugs, instead they release new content. This is because Lucas Arts does not have a clue what it means to run on massive multiplayer online role playin game (mmorpg). They push out new updates and expansions to coinside with movie releases or their agenda when the updates and expansions are still full of bugs, but they do not care about there customer they only want to get the sale. Do not buy this game or you will be sorry that you did.
Oh goodie Prepaid Crap: What can be said that already has been said about this game. Pretty much not worth the time of day. Since the game is barely on life support becareful of getting a 60 day game card-high rumor has it that galaxies maybe pulled soon if things dont pick up enough.
One of the very best!: I first read this book as a pre-teen. Then reread it again and again until the cover began to shred off. The only other books I have read more often are Jane Austin's novels. It is a charming, magical tale, meant to please young children who truly believe in good witches, and the protective nature of bees.
Enchanting and Magical...: I have owned and re-read this book for years without realizing it is now rare and out-of-print. I read it when my life is too hectic, and am carried away by the magic and the age-old struggle of good people reaching for the light while being afraid of the darkness. And, of course, it all comes out well in the end...
Disappointed and Issuing a Caution: As others have mentioned, the first part of this book is very enjoyable. However, I was a little on edge when mention was made of a book of spells and knew the "Linnets and Valerians" was not for my family when the children were directed to chant spells and pull pins out of voodoo dolls to undo the bad magic cast by someone else. In telling the children that what they were doing was okay, Ezra, a servant tells them, "But don't tell your uncle. He'd say it were superstition. I reckon the cleverest men be ignorant at times." The main premise of the book is that some bad things have happened because someone with bad intent used magic, but we of good intent can fix it using magic and then we will get rid of the book of spells. I probably should have given this book one star, but there were a number of likable aspects of the book. I would advise any caring adult to read the book first before giving it to a child you love.
Like finding a long-lost best friend: I read "Linnets and Valerians" over and over as a child, captivated by the magic of a great story. I finally lost my copy of it about 12 years ago, and heart-brokenly discovered that it was out of print. I had the best birthday ever this past year when my sister and mother located a copy in a Denver thrift store. Since then, my mother has seen it several times, so copies are out there if you're willing to look!
A book of common sense and the most glorious magic...: If you loved "The Little White Horse", you'll like this little gem of a book as well. A very few books (like this one) contain a delightful acceptance of everyday "ordinary" magic that is hard to describe - to an adult, that is...The four Linnet children run away from their autocratic grandmother to live in their eccentric uncle Ambrose's bachelor household. He accepts the responsibility for them only on the condition that they submit to an education at his hand..
Review of Crash Impact (1991): Caution! Don't be fooled into purchasing this DVD based on the image shown on the case's front cover. The DVD has no footage of Formula One racing. Very deceptive packaging.
Bronze should be all-caps in the name of this shoe: I'll start out with the statement that this is a good shoe. It fits well and the build quality is fine. It's comfortable and the shape is great.The major problem I have with the shoe is that there is quite a bit of a very, uh, bright bronze on the toe and side "stripe" and lace area of the shoe. The pictures at Amazon.com do not come close to representing it correctly. My sister had ballet slippers that looked just like these areas. It's as bright as a new penny. More copper than bronze. I took a dremel tool with a buffing wheel and got this paint off. I wouldn't recommend anybody else try it. It took a long time (I did it while watching a game on TV), but it at least makes the shoe wearable.Be very aware that the toe, side stripe, and laces area are all a very bright copper.
Really, really terrible: While it was my fault for not reading the description in full, this "documentary" is right-winged hogwash. I had planned to show it in my undergraduate-level education class, but I decided to spare them after watching about four minutes of the film. Save your money. Read a book.
Bongo-Durable-Soft: This is a great addition to a Jungle Themed Room or just a cuddly companion...young or old!!
Good for veggies aswell as meat eaters!: You can use this book year round - lots of ideas for indoor and outdoor cooking - book has lots of variety with stuff for both meat eaters and veggies. The ABC of cooking by AWT is also worth a look as it has good advice for every day cooking...
My Aunt: Hey Aunt Susan I don't know if you read these reviews but it was a really good book, for all you other people you should get this book its awesome. My Aunt wrote it.
HAPPY ISLAND: The colors couldn't be more vivid. It is layered with cut-outs, a sturdy well made board book. Kids will love the colors and pictures and parents will enjoy looking through it and reading to toddlers. It's a mini journey on boats with a scary monster to chase the fish and pirates and treasure at the end.
WARNING--DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!: I ordered similar guns directly from this company. Their return policy is NON-EXISTENT! They say you can return, but they will only "attempt" to repair and send the same gun back and say you only have ONE chance to send the gun back then it is yours. So we have 2 broken guns (because they don't hold up for any length of time) and spent $200.00. I am also going to report this company the BBB and Amazon.com. Order at your own risk--if it breaks or never worked--it yours and you are out the money! DO NOT ORDER YOUR GUN FROM AIRSPLAT!
this is a reaally good gun but i dont see the point of spendin this much for a fake one: I can see where they can probly charge this much because it is an exact replica of the m4 but Why would people use this for training when they could get a real gun and use rubber bullets?it dont make a whole lot of sense to me but i aint gunna say nuthin bad about it if i have ner=ver used it.
seriously: They expect people to shell out that much for an airsoft gun? I'm pretty sure you have better things to spend that 1.5K on instead of a whacked out, overpriced, FAKE, gun that shoots plastic pellets.
THE FACE IS STARING AT MICHIGAN: The book is very interesting but Lloyd and Dean forgot one little detail;The Face is staring at Michigan. Why Michigan? The Lower Penninsula is a right hand facing upwards while the Upper Penninsula is a right hand being wiped across a forehead from left to right. The right hand and forehead are the locations for the Mark of The Beast; 666.By December 22nd, 2012, it won't matter anyways when the world ends and the aliens invade the Earth.
Bone-headed delusion: I was unfortunate to receive this absurd book as a white elephant gift. Only a fool would believe this drivel. The positive reviews above were probably written by the author himself.I once saw a squash that looked like a duck-billed platypus. I think that is a sign from God that the second coming is near.
Fascinating....: Really enjoyed the information in this book! Awesome to discover such clear pictures. Impressed by the references to Bibilical numerics also. Re the Indian ocean figures: the one to the right looks very much like a woman kneeling with mostly her flowing headdress pictured viewed from behind and to one side. (Symbolic of the Revelation 12 woman?)Is there a website that posts updated discoveries?
Like Seeing Faces in the Clouds: I'm glad to hear that this author at least admits that his theory is greatly influenced by his religious beliefs. He has used a hodge-podge of science facts to support a contention based on nothing more amazing than the tendency of the human mind to put some kind of order to random information, be it visual, auditory or otherwise, like looking at the clouds and seeing faces, animals or other objects. I have the feeling that God would have created a face that doesn't need additional illustrations and outlining to see it.
What a Crock: As a fan of the supernatural and avid reader I found this book in a second hand store and took it home. I am grateful that I do most of my reading on the toilet cause this is exactly where this book should be. To go any further than to say "Oh That's Neat" is criminal. To write a book and do a tour promoting this as some prophesy is a big rip off. The book is a bunch of pictures and illustrations followed by some very loose facts and far reaching conclusions trying to verify its authenticity. Save your time and money and read the back of the shampoo bottle, its more entertaining.
Good Laughs, Classic Cheech and Chong style.: I love some of the Cheech and Chong movies, others, I dont really care for, this one is one I liked, I put it behind Up In Smoke, Still Smoking, and Cheech And Chong's Next Movie, which were great...and AHEAD of others such as to give one example - The Corsican Brothers, which seems to follow a different format or something and I didnt particularily like. The humor was good, I just was turned off by the silly parts relating to the [this is a possible spoiler] lizard transformation from the smoking of the weed, it was silly. The detective had goofy over acting too which was annoying. Cheech and Chong were top notch though however so I give this 4 of 5 stars!
Chicken man eats Hamburger Dude!!: I recently bought this movie after reading the reviews on Amazon but I ended up being disappointed...despite Chicken Man's best efforts. My main grumble is the inactivity of Sgt. Stedanko. All he does in this movie is smoke pot, mumble aimlessly and then turn into a lizard!! Things are much better when he's clear-headed and on the case. There are some redeeming moments in the film, namely the mental asylum scenes (where we meet Chicken Man) and also the Chinese restaurant madness...oh (...) However, the rest of the movie just ambles along. I think the only funny moment in the first half of the movie is when we see a lizard smoking pot. In fact I think Mr Chong was suffering from a strange fascination with these reptiles and unfortunately lost all focus on making a good movie. OK man.
laughoutloud: Nostalgia for my childhood recently caused me to buy and watch the Cheech and Chong movies (with the exception of The Coriscan Brothers). Aside from realizing I shouldn't have been watching those movies in my pre-teen days, I realized how well done they are. Most amazing to me was that they held up one after the other, feeling not repetitive, though each of them is rather episodic. Most impressive was Chong's direction; he makes a number of interesting choices that elevate him beyond the status of writer/star who has enough power to direct; clearly, he took this role quite seriously. The movies, of course, are not serious. I rarely laugh out loud in movies these days, but I did at least a half dozen times in each of these. The characters are not only given funny situations in which to work and funny lines to deliver, but each of them is presented with a kind of earnestness that makes them likeable, and the films all he more watchable.
Prolly my Favt Cheech and Chong movie.: I liked this movie alot and I have seen it about 20 times. It is just laid back and does not take a lot to follow it.From the point where they sell there weed out of there old Ice Cream truck and are followed by cops and Sgt Stedanko who a couple years earlier was a serious cop and now makes bust to get the weed.Then they get some weed from Jimmy's house. Then they find out they made 17 million from the deals and celebrate and by goibg out to eat. There is a lady who things chong is Jerry Garcia. Then a Ex girlfriend of Cheech is there with Hamberger dude(Pee Wee Herman)and they do coke. After this She along with Cheech and Chong go back to the hotel for a 3 way.Then her Husband a convict that escaped comes to beat up and Cheech escapes naked and goes up and down a elevator shaft.When they finally get out Cheech finds out Chong gave Hamberger dude all the money and they look for him at Casa Del Wacko's.
Only for true C&C fans: "Nice Dreams" is nowhere near as funny as "Up in Smoke" or "Next Movie". The jokes are lame, the situations have already been done, and C&C look like they're going thru the motions. I laughed twice throughout the whole movie!
Review for non-dopers: Worse than C&C:Next Movie, the gags are getting old and there is little real comedy in this movie.... unless of course you blow your brains out with as much cannabis as you can handle. DON'T DO THIS! Find another movie.
Would you like a Hamburger?: Nice Dreams might be either C & C's second or third best film. They have a movie that might seem weird in the first viewing, but it grows on you after a few viewings, each one getting funnier. And it's not just the funny sequences involving a pot garden, a lizard sergeant or mental patient animals. It's also the little things, like chats by Cheech and Chong about petty stuff that actually might make sense when you go with the flow (like the discussion on Hippie retirement homes).But that's just an observation on the small things. Overall, Nice Dreams is a very hilarious film that has all the things you could want in a C & C movie, and while it doesn't quite match up to the brilliance of Up in Smoke, it does many cool things; one of which is bringing Pee-Wee Herman in the mix as the uproarious Hamburger dude. Love the save the whales song.
This is the only way I would buy them.: I love Cheech and Chong but I always hesitated buying these since they were around $15 a piece. I might of bought other Cheech and Chong movies for that amount but these were not as good as their first few efforts and I just couldn't just toss over $30 for both. I'm glad they did this because I could justify completing my collection of Cheech and Chong.The movies are funny but not Laugh out loud funny most of the time but they are Cheech and Chong and they have some fantastic moments. Don't expect a lot of features to these CD's you get some commentary and a bit of extras but not much.
5 stars!: I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my kids (ages 5 & 8). They've played it for HOURS! They love the fact that they're actually in the game (i.e. swinging at baseballs, punching punching bags, etc.) I enjoy watching them play!I would highly recommend this game. This was certainly one of their highlights for Christmas!
Get up off of that couch: This game is so much fun. My kids had played it at a friend's and got it for Christmas. They really work up a sweat playing. It is fun to play and even fun to watch. The only down side seems to be that you have to have a lot of light for it to work optimally and you need room to move around.
Eye Toy Play 2 Entertains But Sometimes Frustrates...: In general, the eye toy is very entertaining, but the graphics could be better -- they're a bit fuzzy and don't always move readily as indicated by player.
Title is Eye Toy Play 2 WITH CAMERA!: Came with the DVD only. I am returning it. Seller should change the title to reflect the fact that customers need to buy a camera, too.
Who needs Wii???: We don't have the wii but we had PS2 for the longest time. Got this game and my 5 yr old loves the boxing sparring one. Eyetoy is better then wii in certain aspect because you don't need controller. It is total 100% physical interaction. Yes, the camera resolution is horrible but most 4 to 12 yrs old will not care. The kids go crazy when they take high scorer's photo. Excellent game for young kids. Not all games are great in this package. So I gave it 4 stars. IMPORTANT! You must adjust camera lighting and room lighting setting before playing. Otherwise, the games are useless.
Good for little kids: This game is good for little kids, but would be boring for teenagers and adults. It has a number of different games on it and you stand in front of the tv, but mostly you use just your hands to play it. I was looking for one more for adults to play and this is not it. However your young children might enjoy it.
Great Game, BUT...: At first, I was very satisfied with this game, its concept, and its execution. It is very fun and gives kids a great workout. It is targeted at little children and kids of all other ages. That being said, the game hit a very wrong chord with me. One of the many games on it involves pretending to prepare food. At one point, a chef comes to challenge you (my 4 year old son) to a cooking duel. When my son beat him, the game said "Damn, you beat me". I do not want to expose my children to such language and I find it annoying that a game that targets children would contain such language.
Great, affordable family fun!: My experience with these games has been mostly great and a little frustrating. These games are perfect for a younger (6-8) video game player. My son sweats when he plays! I feel better about his playing this than other sedentary games. They are also for 4 players, so getting everyone in on the action is possible. There have been some bugs, and it doesn't always respond the way you want. The single player versions are usually a little less frustrating. For us Wii resisiters, it is affordable, active and exciting.
Great addition to our playstation: We ordered this as a Christmas present and the kids love it! The neighborhood kids love it, too! We like that it gets the kids up and moving, instead of just sitting to play their games. My husband and I have actually enjoyed it, also. I've never really enjoyed playing video games with the kids until this. The boxing is very fun, and the kids really have a laugh at the way I move doing it.
Highly recommended: Great game, keeps kids on the move and not just sit there moving their thumbs. My kids enjoy this game, even their friends like to come over and play.
Hearty word salad: This work is a magnificent epic for the mind that traces the lineage of one man's search for meaning - that strangely mirrors the evolution of an academic subject. Lovers of language are in for a real feast, as the author weaves a beautiful web of words.The reader takes part in a multifaceted task of understanding the structures of scientific thought and the magical ways in which words dictate what we think. Fuzzy Sets takes place on the borderlands of the intellect, where things are not always as they appear. Explore your thought patterns and the systems of thought that either keep you restrained, or set you free.If you enjoy works that delightfully peel back layers of information to discover what lies beneath, this book will richly satisfy.
Good idea for boards maybe - didn't work for chalkboard painted walls: I was hoping this would be a solution for cleaning off our giant chalkboard wall. It absolutely did not work for that surface. The cloth caught on every tiny bump and tore apart.
Not a bad track to be found!: Travis has got one solid album in "You and You Alone." It has love songs, rockers, even a cowboy song. His voice is smooth and self-assured, and the songs are all strong. Guaranteed to please.
Super merde!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Bande d'pais!!! C de la merde de A ? Z. Dans 3 ans, les marches aux puces seront chargs de cette merde!!!!!!!!!
RANEY HAS EXCELLED!: This wonderfully written story of extended family relationships, faith in God's timing, and learning to trust after tragedy, will keep you turning pages to the end. These characters are so richly drawn you will laugh when they laugh and cry when they cry. Have the kleenex close by!
No wonder this book won so many awards: This book was a HOLT Medallion winner, RITA finalist, finalist for the National Readers Choice Award and The Booksellers Best Award. It seems like every time an awards list came out last year, this book was on it. And no wonder!! It is a touching, page-turning story of characters I'll never forget.
I wouldn't use it again: I bought this for use in my classroom, but it was dreadfully dull. Chaucer is funny; he's bawdy; he's ironic. But as told in this drab DVD, it's almost as good as Ambien. I ended up talking about the Prologue as I usually do, which according to my students is both animated and engaging--two qualities completely alien to this film. And at $49.99 for 14 minutes?? What was I thinking???
Worst Buy....Prologue to the Canterbury Tales: I have always been satisfied with my buys from Amazon, but this product was a colossal waste of money. $49.95 for 14 minutes of sub-standard information. I would give it away free......Do not buy this DVD...less than a star, maybe 0.25 of one.
Too little text: This magazine is less than 100 pages long and only five (5) pages are devoted to text describing how to date photos. While there is some useful information, it is too little. The rest of the pages are just old photos that are grouped by era, with no annotations to help you determine how the photo is dated. If you really want to know how to date photos as the title suggests, try a different book.
Dating Old Photos: This "book" is actually a short essay. It was long on examples of oldphotographs, but did little examination of those examples. The essayis 5 pages and photos ran from page 8 to 93 with 5 to 6 photos on each page.These photos were not identified as to their type of photographic method.It is a fine example of a geneological collection of family photos forthe author, but hardly a book to learn from. I was quite disappointed.
old photos: Definately not worth the money. Lots of good photos grouped by time period, but almost no information on the characteristics that date the photo.
Not worth the money :(: Used, I paid over $50 for a "magazine" that basically just has lots of old pictures in it. It is only 93 pages long. Very little text telling you HOW to actually date photographs. Incidentally, the price on the back says $12.00. Not worth buying. Choose a different publication. This is a rip off for the price.
Lots of pictures, not so much help in interpreting how to apply them to dating my own photos.: I thought this book would be of help in dating my own photos, but it needs more explanation to do that. I gather I'm supposed to infer how to date my own photos from looking at examples, but I'm not too good at inferring.
Excellent Product: I have used several products from this brand, Physician Formulas, and found all of them superior products. This particular product I decided to try along with my sleep disorder (PLMS-Periodic Limb Movement Syndrome, of which I have a severe case) rx meds (Requip)5-HTP 50 mg, 60 capshoping to not have to increase my dose. They worked so well, I went in and told my MD, who did some research and not only approved but said he was going to recommend them to other patients.
Item didn't come as how picture shows: I bought my beanie buddy from the website below and was expecting to receive the toy as it showed on the website:http://www.amazon.com/TY-Beanie-Buddy-HOPE-Praying/dp/B00002SWVY/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1243375694&sr;=1-2but somehow the toy I received was this one:http://www.amazon.com/Ty-Beanie-Buddy-Hope-Praying/dp/B001ISD42O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1243375694&sr;=1-3It looks totally different and the fur falls when I touch it. I think the seller posted to a wrong place, so I am disappointed and doesn't know what to do with this toy now. Amazon should be careful on whether the item was posted properly and whether it fits to the description. It wasn't a good and reliable experience for me on Amazon. Toy didn't come as how it looks like on the picture.
Nice canisters: These were ordered for my sister. I thought they were kind of small, but she liked them. They were very well made with a unique shape.
very very dissatisfied: recieved the package, the wrapping paper was rip up the box was smashed, it looked like some else had it first i bought it new and had it wrapped for a wedding shower.
Great canister set: I was a little nervous about ordering this set because I only saw the pictures, but when I recieved them I was more the pleased. The lids are very tight and they hold alot. but best of all they look great on my counter top!
From Rags to Riches to Murder: This is a classic story of a family destroyed and a mother's attempt to shield her daughter. Left financially insecure after a divorce, Mildred experiences the American dream and builds up a successful business of her own. Her happiness is marred by her cheating second husband and a rebellious daughter. The situation worsens until the climax and Mildred must then choose between herself and her daughter.Always suspenseful and engaging, the characters in Mildred Pierce are very down to earth and believable. Although I am French and not American, I could identify with Mildred, her hopes and her fears.This is a great book and highly entertaining.
Remarkable: A remarkable story of human relationships, complexities, perseverance, and weakness!All too often people turn a blind eye to what they refuse to believe, or perhaps can't comprehend - and we see this played out in the interactions of Mildred and her daughter Veda! This adds to the reader's involvement and emotional responses to this stunning and well told novel. A powerful piece of writing!
Focus On Mother-Daughter Instead of Man-Woman: I never met a James M. Cain novel I didn't like and this one was no exception. The title is of the lead character who rises to great success during the Depression with a series of restaurants in early California. However, she has one big problem: the daughter she raised alone, Veda. Veda becomes a singer and also a master at deceiving and betraying her mother. Veda does not even consider her mother's spouse, her stepfather, off limits. This showcases the same intense Cain focus on a twisted relationship but this time it is on the mother-daughter relationship, arguably a more powerful one than the lover-lover one. This was made into a movie starring Joan Crawford, who won an Oscar playing Mildred. I thought this film version went too over the top though and veered into being maudlin and soap operaish. Stick with Cain's novel, the far more complex work.
Great: This was an interesting twist on the original Mildred Pierce. Kate Winslet is not Joan Crawford, but she did a good job.
It's a perfect gift!: I bought this book for my mother and she loves it! When I gave it to her, she got so happy. She loved the HBO version with Kate Winslet, so I thought that she would enjoy the original source.
A Driven Life: Mildred Pierce's life is driven by her determination to rise from poverty to a position of financial independence. Her "love-hate" relationship with her horrid daughter, Veda, (who she perhaps sees a bit of herself in) fuels this drive. Without education, breeding, or work experience outside the home she manages to achieve professional and financial success beyond her wildest dreams.But Mildred's wild ride from rags to riches is fraught with personal loss. Moreover, her illogical devotion to Veda threatens to thwart her good fortune at every turn. Her harrowing and surprising life journey will keep you riveted, for sure!Sarah Bruce KellyAuthor of VIVALDI'S MUSE, JAZZ GIRL, and THE RED PRIEST'S ANNINA
Seriously good reading - but it ain't your Joan Crawford story: I LOVED this book! I read it in anticipation of the HBO mini-series. Actually, I read it in between part one and part two. Could not put it down. I really enjoyed the extra detail in the book - the slice-of-life from those Depression days and a really cool look inside the mind of a really screwball woman. It's funny to think about the fact that it was written by a man - what must he think of us gals? I haven't really gotten into analyzing it to that depth, but maybe one day I will and this review might embarrass me. I better cut it short. The book is fantastic. The mini-series is great. The original movie is still a classic, though very different in tone from the book and tv series. (Is there such a thing as a 'book noir?')Mildred Pierce
THIS BOOK WAS AHEAD OF ITS TIME: The book and the movie are both great. The content of this book was a little unusual for the 1940s. I was surprised that the book has a totally different ending than the movie. I have seen the movie several times, and decided to read the book. I am so glad I did, and my husband really enjoyed this book too. Mildred is a great character. She was a woman before her time. Stepping out to have her own business. Not too many women in those times would have had the courage to do such a thing. Her daughter, Veda, is a BRAT. Mildred is a "disney land" parent. She thinks the more she gives the more her daughter will love her. This is a good example for divorced parents today. They feel compelled to give their kids too many "material" things and they really just need to spend more time with their children and learn to say "No". If you haven't read or seen the movie, I would suggest you do both.
Character Complexity At Its Finest: Mildred Pierce is a novel ahead of its time. James Cain is a talented writer and creates a set of complex characters, none of whom the reader sympathizes with for the entirety of the novel. I look forward to reading more of his work in the future.
Brilliant portrait of domestic evil: If you think that rotten, ungrateful children began in the 90's (or ended with King Lear's daughters), meet Vida Pierce, Mildred's daughter, an amoral young thing with a talent for singing and a disdain for anything low. Watch as Vida climbs to the top of the radio singing world and seduces her stepfather.Excellent character study, and source for the great film which gave Joan Crawford her Oscar
Funny, sad, and sort of strange.: It took me a while to warm up to this book...Luard's writing style takes a bit of getting used to-- a sort of posh/bohemian thing that, to me at least, seems unique to British writers.But Luard's writing about her daughter's illness is amazing. It's loving, moving, beautiful, and terrible. It's also shocking, because the tone of this memoir very abruptly changes from this jovial story about an eccentric family's travels to a different, much more serious, story altogether. I don't think I have ever been so moved by a book.
Flimsy and damaged: Gave to my daughter as a Christmas present. She tells me that the box it came in was falling apart, appeared to have been wet at some time (when tried to open it, it just fell apart). Grout gone from tiles on table top, several tiles missing. Others loose. Whole thing seems flimsy and poor quality. Did not go to the trouble of putting the pieces together, am returning for refund.
Not as good as competition.: If you only need moderately sharp blades, these should be good enough. That said, if you don't need really, really sharp blades, you probably aren't changing blades that often, therefore buying them in packs of 100 really isn't worth it.If you, like me, are obsessive about always having a perfectly sharp blade to get perfect cuts in paper or thin plastic, you should spend a few extra dollars and buy the excel bladesNo. 11 Blades Bulk, which in my experience, are much sharper.
Blech: I realized at the end of the day.. Stick to what you know. I normally buy Xacto blades for stenciling. I go thru blades fast so I figured buying this pack of 100 would save me some money... All it honestly has done is give me aggravation. I used this brand to cut thru .003 acetate paper, it would snag and tear along the sheet, it wasn't as sharp as I wanted. U could use it for a good 5 minutes before it craps out on u... I read the reviews before I bought them and I figured u guys would steer me I the right direction. Not this time. If u have to spend a little extra for better quality, then do it. Now I have 100 dull blades on hand, and no use for em
Very poor: I purchased these blades thinking they would be similar quality to other brands. I liked that they were made in USA. But the quality was terrible. Many of them didn't even have points on the blades, and the ones that did dulled or broke almost immediately. I'm a paper cut artist, so I spend a great deal of time working with these blades. I ended up returning these and sticking to excel.
Sharp!: These blades fit my ancient Xacto blade holder, and are sharp. I really don't know what more to say about them - they work to cut things!
Great value: I had been buying blades 5 at a time at the local arts & crafts store for about $6 a pack, but will never buy them that way again! So, these blades are cheap, but if the tip snaps off, you have 99 more!
Exactly what I needed: I am an Interior Design student in college and am always going through 10 of these a day! Pack was just what I needed!
Muy sharpo!: Very sharp but these do not seem to be as sharp as the last package of techni edge I used but are so much better than xacto which are useless for my needs
Gets the Job Done: Well they are certainly hobby blades...Blades are of good quality, very sharp, and worked for my purpose. The only thing I could say is that they are not cut as precisely as an Xacto blade (the cut is a bit sloppy and the metal feels a bit thinner), but considering the cost difference this is entirely negligible. I burn through blades pretty quick cutting and scraping plastic model molding so quantity and price are more important than quality.Honestly almost any hobby blade is going to dull long before the quality of the materials makes a big difference. I would certainly save the money and go with these.
Great Blades: I was very surprised, at half the price of X-Acto blades,these blades work as well. I shall continue buying them.
Are you kidding me?: After the very first use--the very first--the teflon coating is already peeling off exposing the steel below it. I made pasta in the pot and used a SOFT plastic spatula to gently stir it. After that there were already two spots where the coating had come completely off. Now I have used it about 5 times total and the coating looks like it has been scraped with a metal spatula hundreds of times. And no, I did not put it in the dishwasher. Not even once. I used a very soft plastic spatula and did not stir hard. I've had far better quality from an $7.99 pot purchased at a discount store. I seriously don't understand how the quality could be so poor and this company is still in business. Avoid this unless you want to eat teflon flakes with your pasta.
Mirro Get-A-Grip 3-Quart Nonstick Aluminum Saucepan with Lid: The pan is OK. The bottom of the pan is not heavy like other pans that I bought. My food was burned faster than I expected.
Okay camera...when it works!!: My teenage daughter bought this camera with money she had saved. It worked well for a few months and then quit. Every time you turn it on, it will stay on for a few seconds and then beep that the batteries are dead then turn itself off. This happens every time, even when the batteries are fresh out of the package. This camera was a waste of money.
useless after 2 months: I bought this camera used but I could tell by how pristine the exterior was that it wasn't used much. I was very happy with it for about 2 to 3 months then one day I went to turn it on and none of the icons or menu items appeared on the display. The display was working and showing the picture that the lens was capturing but none of the buttons worked or mode selector knob and nothing else showed up on the screen. If left alone the picture on the screen would freeze and not do anything. Only way to get it to work would be to remove the batteries and try turning it back on again and eventually it'd start working till it got worse and worse and took longer and longer to get it to work. After such short time and little use I was NOT expecting to have a flawless looking paperweight so for that I give it 1 star.
good features, poor quality: Bought one from Amazon, which was defective upon receipt. Amazon replaced with a new unit immediately, great service. Replacement unit worked for a few weeks and then was freezing up without warning, and now does not want to restart most times. Will be returning to Amazon. Too bad, as camera is good value, large screen, easy to use, but I got stuck with 2 lemons.
batteries do not last: my husband bought me this camera about 3 yrs. ago and its time for a new one. This camera is good when you can get the batteries to work! first i used rechargables, didnt last, and now no batteries will work. doesnt last long..
A sorry excuse for a camera: We've had this camera for well over a year now, and I'm extremely disappointed with it. From new it hasn't worked with the regular batteries--just freezes up when you go to press the shutter. We've had better success with rechargables (it does have two battery setting depending on what kind of battery you're using and we've tried both settings) but it still freezes up without warning. We have to take the batteries out and leave them out for 30 seconds to 5 minutes before the thing will work again. Batteries don't last long at all. The shutter response is very slow, disappointing when you're trying to catch a fleeting smile from a small child. The only reason we put up with it for this long is because we can't afford a new one and film is too expensive to use in my nice SLR film camera with the amount of pictures I take.
Not worth it: I got this camera as a gift. The users guide was unclear and required lots of steps to do even the littlest thing.The pictures were blurred and fuzzy and then everytime I tried to take a picture the screen would say "No Pictures" It was crazy. So I called Samsung and this representive made me do like tons of things to it and none of it worked. He labeled it as defecteve. So I took it back to Target with the gift recipt and asked if a lot of these cameras were coming in as defective. He said yes, so then he showed me the awsome hp Photosmart M425 which was the same price and i exchanged it. The hp is great for me with no bulging battery compartment on the front unlike the samsun. The hp was easy to use with only 9 buttons and a takes crystle clear images. Dont waste your money on a horrible camera.
Disappointed: I bought this camera Sunday, and return it Tuesday. If you get lucky, you get 1 good picture out of 10. You get good picture, if you are 4-5 yard away from the object, and zoom in. Is the object in front of you, like flowers, what ever you try, the picture aren't clear. Night shots take 5 or more seconds, in this time you have to hold the camera still. Picture from my cat, with night shot, the eyes looks pretty scary.My 6 years old camera "Agfa ePhoto", takes better pictures, as the Samsung Digimax S500.
Inferior Product: This camera is not worth anything. Every picture that I have taken with it so far has been terrible. The photos blur easily. Even with the settings tweaked to have sharp clear images, they still turn out badly. I don't think that the features like sepia tone, red, green, blue, and the other features make up for the fact that this product is inferior.
Great Camera so far!: I just bought this camera two days ago. I got it for $148. SO far the camera is awesome. There weren't too many reviews for it when I was researching, but I like. I have not owned a digital camera before, so I don't know what to compare it to but it is awesome. The screen is really big and clear.
Good camera for the money.: So far I am impressed. We bought this for our 10 year old grandson. he takes great pictures with it.Pros: very easy to use,nice features. Most cameras this price range dont have optical zoom.Cons: shutter speed a little slow and flash a little slow on recovery, but no worse than any other camera I have seen yet in this price range.
Unusable because of battery consumption: I made the mistake of buying two of these. One for my wife and one for my son at the same time. Sure, they are cheap, but they should at least work like a camera. They take double A batteries. You are literally lucky to get 10 pictures out of a set of new batteries. Sometimes you get 3 or 4. You literally have to carry a pocketful of batteries to use this camera. Sure, the pictures are great, you just can't take any. There is nothing more frustrating. I have an old Cannon Elph that will take literally hundreds of pictures on one charge. These guys are begging for a class action lawsuit.
dark, violent ... and a fairly good read: 'Vampire$" by John Steakley is novel about rag-tag bunch of American vampire hunters for hire. These guys live for the thrill and horror of killing vampires, and in-between they get drunk and act stupid. The vampires themselves are truly monsterous and powerful. Forget Bela Lugosi.While I found the characterizations of the vampire hunters to be a bit weak and very uninteresting, the portrayal of the vampires and the methods of battling them to be very well-written ... and fascinating. The battle sequences are exciting, violent and unpredictable. So I find myself trudging through the dull narrative about the vampire hunters' lives while anxiously awaiting the next battle sequence.Bottom line: forget about the vampire hunter soap opera and read the book for those terrific vampire-killing sequences. Recommended.
Great, if you like purple prose.: I had high hopes for this book because I'm a great fan of vampire literature and like James Woods and all that but when I first started reading this book I couldn't figure out what was bothering me, distressing me and then I figured out it was Steakley's writing style which goes on and on like this forever and forever with no letup, beating us, blinding us, giving no quarter, making me wish for just one period, even one, and then when he finally comes to the end of a sentence he ends it.In the next paragraph. And when he's not doing that, he begins paragraph after paragraph with the same word:And this got really irritating.And it was because the story was weak.And the characters even weaker.And maybe by the end I just didn't care.
OK but just not what I like: Vampire$: A NovelWell written but the storyline just didn't quite grab me. Just not my kinda vampire book I guess
Retarded: I loved Steakley's book "Armour", which I read when young, and still think about. It was superb. Based on the strength of that book I bought this book the second it appeared in the book store.I was sorely disappointed. This book is simplistic, one-dimensional, and lame. I about flipped when I saw them make it into a movie; oh well, I guess all things Vampire are hot now. In conclusion; forget about this book, buy "Armour", you'll be happier in the end.
Incredibly Fun: Now, I gave this book 5 stars and by that I do not mean it to be a total classic like the Illiad, but this book was an immense amount of fun. I truly have never had as much fun reading a book as i did this one. There are better books, but there are very few that are this much fun. The movie was a complete travesty in terms of trying to relate the book. DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE. Do read the book.
Loved the book Hated the movie: I first read Vampire$ quite a few years ago when it first hit the stands. After the first time I read it I read it again. Soon the book was little more than a mangled mess. Which remindes me of the movie. If there was ever a book turned movie this one is further from the orignal story line than any other one ever done. Had the movie been true to the book, that would have been one bad a%# movie.
Yawn.: So I finally spot this novel I've read so much about on the net....what a letdown. I was expecting so much more, you know, like maybe some insight into the vampire myth, some great characters, geez, even a good story for cripes sake. What I got were cardboard characters, weak plot and run-on sentences like you wouldn't believe. Save your money & time and read Interview With a Vampire instead. This same review score can also apply to Steakley's Armour as well. Sorry folks, overrated in my book, anyway.
Florid, Lurid and other -ids: This is not a boring book, oh no, but it has some major faults. Here's one, which pretty much killed the last part of the book for me, and hence, no real payoff: **SPOILER WARNING** the reveal of the bigbad vamp, the one we've heard but not quite seen, the one pushing all the buttons, the one that ~ heck, it would have been more satisfying if Steakley had just said, "Aw, it's Dracula" ~ ?? Yeah that one. Turns out he's actually NO ONE WE'VE EVEN HEARD OF UP TO THAT POINT IN THE BOOK. So when Felix says, "The bastard's name is..." you will respond with, "I'm sorry, WHO?".No punch. A lynch-pin disclosure in the book and it lacks any dramatic impact. Steakley tries to tell us all about him then, in the few paragraphs before he gets wasted by Team Crow anyway, but you won't care.Why didn't he make it one of the George Bushes? J.R. Ewing? That would have been more interesting.
Vampire's beware........: The idea of the Catholic Church sposered vampire hunter troupe is an itreaging one opening up a new line the fight against evil. Gone are the bookish Professor Van Helsing and the 'chosen' cheerleader Buffy Summers, replaced with a gang of hard fighting, hard drinking killers with pikes, crossbows and dinamite led by Jack Crow, a chain smoking corse giant of a man who effectivle runs the fighting side of the agency known as Vampie$ Inc. This all changes as the S*** hits the fan. the hunters become the hunted as an ancient vampire decides that Crow has gone far enough and must be elimenated or turned. The Book is almost in three parts, part one is the told primarily for Crow's perspective, the second is the history of Davette's relationship with a 'master' vampire and the third is from the persective of Felix, a gunslinger who becomes a reluctant member of Team Crow. All in all a wonderfull story with plenty of action and suspense. Well worth a read.
a shame: Terrible.'Armor' was a good book. This is cr@p. Throwing us into the middle of a vampire vs humans fight is fine, but it was all so self conscious and over the top. I suppose those who like the vampire movie by Tarantino would like this. I gave him about 60 pages. That's over an hour of my life I'll never get back... The dialogue is cheezy, the characters have no depth. It's like someone took a comic book and removed the pictures. Yuck.
A good reiteration of a vampire roleplay campaign.: First: Unique, original text that is NOT a clone of other Vampire books/flicks. Second: Nothing like the Movie, which is good. Third: It seems like a someone wrote it as if he took it from there roleplaying campaign. Could of been edited better. Fourth: A must read if your into the Vampire Genre
I've lost sleep reading this!: This is a book to read and re-read again! You can't absorb it all in one visit. The characters are rich and seductive and you ache for each one of them, be they good guys or bad. It's detailed with familiar acurate Texas sights and lush with breathing characters that draw you into a completly believable plot... I have lived in Dallas all my life, and now I'm watching for these guys/vampires as I drive down the street! Light a candle and read the first chapter...take a sick day, keep reading... this book will stick in your head for weeks.
This is a two day book, which means...: This is a two day book to me. What I mean by that is that you don't eat, sleep, drink, water the dog or cat for the duration of those two days so that you may read this book. I really didn't put it down. I don't know if I should curse John for letting my studies fall behind or thank him!
these vamps can do everything!: John Steakly is an incredible author, with such books as Armor, which not to mention kicked *#!, and Vampire$, quite the thriller, a little, say, morose though. I thought that Crow was a well put together character, even if he was a little macho. (hah! a little?) This is a great book anyway, why, that even makes it better! This is second only to Armor. Go get it! It's great!
Interesting ideas, but...: I picked up this book because I saw and liked the movie. The concept of a crew of workaday vampire killers and their specialized equipment intrigued me. I hoped there would be more of that in the book than there was in the movie, but I was disappointed.And what a tough read! Macho men and women as envisioned by a Sci Fi conventioneer. The painful chapter about the tragic heroine lifted from bad gothic romances was almost unreadable and killed whatever momentum the book had. More shallow than most comic books.Stick with the movie even though it falls apart towards the end. James Woods is terrific.
It Started Out Pretty Good.....: than it got real boring. I thought the movie was a great B movie romp but the book was terrible. With about 70 pages to go I decided I could not take it anymore and gently placed it into the garbage can.
Sucked: This book sucks; It's so bad I only read up to chapter 9 (not enough even half way through it). Too many characters think that they are so clever that frankly they are just annoying. The plot could be interesting; but, the author does not know how to deliver it. I recommend this book for the trash can only.
Dissapointment!: This book started off good (it has a lovely dedication)...but then it starts glorifying the Catholic Church??? If I want propaganda I will go watch Jimmy Swagart. a little action that is repetitive and boring character development. If you want a great, interesting and fun Vampire book ...read Already Dead.
Foul Language Killed It: The foul language in this book was constant and completely unnecessary to the storyline. After 30 pages I gave up and refuse to read it anymore. I was also disappointed because John Steakley's ARMOR is one of the few books I have read several times. I would rate ARMOR an 8 or 9. (It would be a 10 if there was less Jack Crow and more Felix.) I have regularly scanned bookshelves for a new book by Steakley so this was a bitter disappointment
Bad book. Better movie.: I just finished reading the Vampire$. I felt terribly cheated that John Carpenter's movie out shines the novel on which it was based. The novel is overly 'campy'. The writing is fast and poor, and leaves you to wonder how some of the characters get from one end of a room to the other. It is as if John Steakly just sat down and wrote this book in a day. Read it if you must, there are plenty of better vampire books out there.
A vampire book for all readers: Easily one of the best and most entertaining vampire books out there. When evaluating a book I always ask myself would I read the book again, would I recommend the book to a casual reader, and would I recommend the book to a serious reader of the book's genre. All three are check marks regarding this one. I've read it multiple times, people who don't necessarily enjoy horror/vampire literature have enjoyed it, and active horror/vampire literature readers have enjoyed it as well. In fact, this is a book that every person I recommended it to also recommended it to someone else. Yes, it's that entertaining. The only 0 associated with this book is the movie adaptation. Do yourself a favor, skip it. Cheers.
A perfect book for all horror fans: This book is beautifully written and it's full of horror beyond your imagination. I've never regretted buying this book. It's the best horror novel I have ever known and I'm proud to own this book.
in a different vein: I've read many vampire books, and most all of them treat vampires as mystical, saintly creatures. This is one of the first books I've read that portrays vampires as what they would be if they actually existed, monsters. A great read with enough humor thrown in to make the scary parts that much scarier
Great read: This book is very good. I tell you it is nothing like the movie at all accept for the names of two charecters and the fact that they kill vampires. The charecters are very interesting. Felix and Jack being the coolest. We have Felix who is extremely rich but no one knows but Annabelle. He is a gunman who hates guns and fighting. Yet it is the thing he was born to do. Then we have Jack Crow a behemoth of a man who has spent so much time doing government work he can get away with basically anything. The story is a very good read I have read it four times now.
Sometimes a film is better than the book.: This is definitely one of those cases. First of all I am a huge vampire fan. I don't go so far as to dress as one, but I am a big fan nevertheless. I've watched the John Carpenter film before I read the book. The stories are not related at all, a big plus for the book. I loved the story of the novel and it's unique approach to vampire slaying which thankfully, made it to the film. Now for the bad. The writing felt like it was written by a child. Not even in a simplistic innocent way, but by some fifth grader doing his best horror-noir impression. The character development really suffers from this, as well as the dialogue. I found myself confused with a lot of the scenes, having to flip back a few pages just to clarify what had just transpired.Overall, I'd say stay far away. Try I Am Legend by Richard Matheson, which even though written in 1954, still delivers the goods for a vampire novel.
Vampires: I was very disappointed with the expletives used LIBERALLY throughout the book. I did not finish it.
Strong starter, weak from page 50 on: Bleuach!!! The horror in this book was for horrible. A strong beginning but it then spiraled into weak adolescent fantasy. The characters were cardboard, the vampires were Romero revisited ala "Night of the Living dead". The one small concept addressed in the book which is interesting dealt with Vampire sex or lack thereof.
If you liked the movies you'll love the book.: Sometime after I see a good movie I'll read the book to see if it adds something the movie missed or as in this case is better. I enjoyed the characters of Jack Crow and Felix, the balls to the wall vampire hunter and the old west gunfighter, kind of the new to the old twist. The book makes the vampires out to be more the monsters they are then in old movies and that heroes can have bad days too and don't always win over evil.
Vampires for non-vampire fans: Excellent book, with a few hidden cross-overs to Steakley's previous book, "Armor" (anyone catch the "Antwar Saloon"?). I wouldn't waste time or money on the movie. I can't believe the producers even read the book on which it was loosely based. I've seen some online chat conversations with John Steakley and some of his fans, and look forward to anything he may write in the future.
Good, but not quite 5 stars: If you've seen the movie, forget all about it while you read this book. Nothings the same except a couple character names and one or two scenes. This is one of the better Vampire books around, altho the psychological aspects didn't come through as much as they did in Armor (a 5 star book which every sci-fi fan should read). The little references to Armor (Felix & Jack Crow, the Antwar bar) are cute but actually detracted from it for me
Best in ages: I read at least 200 books a year and this has become one of my favorites of all time. Vampire$ is one of the few books out there that you can not put down once you open it. It has great characters and storylines and should become a classic horror novel along with the likes of "IT", "Dragon Tears", and "Dracula". All in all the books rocks!!!!!!!!!!
John Steakley's Vampire$: A Human Side to the Vampire Myth: Steakley's "Vampire$" is not a book for the philosophic. Instead, it broaches the idea of the vampire as a monster. Gone are the ponderings of the more inactive protagonist (such as Louie in "Interview...") and instead we meet, and learn to care, about a group of hunters who try not to think too much about what they do! It is only through action that they all attempt to deal with situations which would drive a normal man mad. This wonderful blend of human personalities linked to the common cause, the erradication of Vampires, made for a new slant at an old genre. It is worth the read.
Global Beat Enlightenment: I loved it! I bought 4 and gave them out to friends for MY birthday! One can literally hear the music in Beres' words as he lyrically weaves a seamless mix of myth, music and ritual...Hit Play...Read on...The Global Beat journey has just begun...
Back to fitness hits the mark.: Doctor Di and Doctor Todd provide a refreshing approach to prevention of low back pain through exercise. Chapter one provides a well rounded background on the potential causes of low back pain from both a physical and physiological perspective. Focus on core musculature and lumbar stabilization have been a long standing conservative approach to the treatment & prevention of back pain in the field of physical therapy. Dr. Di & Dr. Todd bring this approach to one's own living room. Back to Fitness is an easy to follow exercise program and is an excellent home exercise program for patients recovering from injury and for the general population to improve core strength and avoid injury.[...]
Don't vaste your time!!!: I am so sorry I spend $26.99 on this DVD. It is a vaste of money and time. I feel like a got an amateur video with very poor exercises. The "Doctors" look fake.
Very amateurish: I have several dvd's on yoga and exercises for back pain; this one was a BIG disappointment. It's almost embarrassingly amateurish and wasn't helpful in the least. I'm giving it to the thrift shop (though I hope no one pays more than a quarter for it). I received an e-mail ad for it from Amazon and it was rated five stars, so you can imagine my surprise!
Not Worth The Money: I have to agree with the reviewers who believe that this DVD is uninspiring and not well done. The presenters ARE amateurish and reading from an awkward script.Counting would be good to prevent back misalignment. Except for the warm-up and cool-down, where the stretches aren't held nearly long enough, the entire workout consists of a hands-and-knees position, where the arms and shoulders get more of a workout than the back and leg muscles, and a lying-down series of pelvic tilts and mild crunches. Not bad exercises, but not enough variety, not enough repetitions, and, most importantly, no thorough explanation of how to optimally tighten the abdominal muscles.
Wonderful step-by-step instructions, great illustraions: This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in pen & ink drawing. Instead of trying to explain techniques in detailed text, it shows you step by step with color illustrations. It is written for all levels & the instructions are easy to follow.There is information on types of lines, value and contrast. A wide variety of techniques are also covered. These include, dry surface, damp surface, wet on wet, spatter, blotting, impression, stamping and salt & alcohol.It shows how to draw & paint metallic objects (gold, silver, iron, rust), baskets, pottery, brick, stone, marble, granite, textiles, clouds, weather, earth textures, rocks, wood, trees, leaves, foliage, flowers, fruit, & eggs.Another section includes instruction on drawing transparent objects such as glass, eyes and many varieties of water. There is also a section on animals covering butterflies, animal hair, scales & feathers.
Not what I expected or wanted: A better title would have been, "Creating Textures in Pen & Ink, Enhanced with Watercolor." 75% of each texture comes down to "make a detailed ink drawing". The other 25% is enhancing that ink drawing with watercolor. The pen & ink predominates everywhere. If this is the style of drawing you desire (e.g., detailed drawings where pen&ink predominates), then you will probably give this book 4 to 5 stars. I was looking for watercolor texture techniques and was disapointed.With that said, the drawings are very well executed and the instruction quality moderate. The author relies too heavily on step-by-step examples as a teaching tool. The addition of color greatly enhances the pen & ink drawings, with spectacular results.
A great tutorial: This book offers practical solutions for beginning watercolorists which will improve their representational skills while encouraging additional exploration on their own.
Creating Textures in Pen & Ink with Watercolors: This book arrived in good time, excellent condition and I love it. A wonderful book that gives good information that is easy to follow. I will use it a lot. Thank you so much.
Mediocre: The information is good but nothing out of the ordinary and nothing more than one would expect a beginner watercolorist to know. The illustrations exemplifying how to apply the techniques are unimpressive. 90% of the illustrations are mediocre, the hatching is repetitive and the end result looks like every subject depicted is made of the same texture; namely hairy lines. The artist's skill is like a hobbyist and less like scientific illustrators. This book should have big bold letters that read "creating textures in pen & ink with watercolor FOR ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS"
Great Book!: I really enjoy this book! I purchased it to get fresh ideas on how to use pen & ink with watercolor types of art. First, I will say, the pens and ink suggested by this author are very expensive. Be ready to spend some money on some expensive pens!! This book describes how to use pen and ink to create textures in your watercolor paintings. It is not really what I would consider a beginners book unless you are experienced with both mediums. She does not teach you how to draw in this book. I have used watercolors, but I am new to pen and ink. Overall, this is a good book for ideas an how to use color washes with pen and ink.
Slammin': for those who enjoy good club music, you will not be disappointed. awesome mix and choice of beats. one problem, junior used a pop song one of the tracks.... shameful, but I was able overlook this one blemish since the rest of the 2cd set is just phenomenal. well worth every dollar i spent on it
Junior's Best Work Yet: As an avid fan of Junior's work, i give this compilation the best review from his past two. Junior took the best songs from Arena and Twilo and brought them together to make one of the greatest album out there. I agree that listening to these CD's is like being at Twilo and Arena. If you haven't had the chance to hear Junior live, then crawl out under from your rock and get to NY. Go to Twilo but make sure you have enough E-nergy to last till the early morning hours. Keep clubbing hard.
The Tribal Beats Do It: While Junior's days of residency at Twilo are over, one can relive them with this CD. Junior lives up to his reputation, and as a result is the highest paid DJ in the world. The first disc mixes phat tribal beats w/ junior's garage/jungle, adn lets it rip. Junior throws down an amazing intro. to meet her at the Love Parade, and along with the effects sets it off. WHile the second disc is a little (a lot) tamer, the music feels more controlled. While I haven't seen Junior live in a while, I still like to look back on those days, especially when he was a resident at Sound Factory before it became Twilo.
Superb, as Junior always is.: This CD is some of Junior's finest spinning. Upon it's debut, this compilation was spun over a TWILO on Saturday night back in 98 and it was pumping back then. This cd shows junior's flawless remixing style and gives a taste of the tribal style that he has mastered. As a resident DJ at Twilo on Saturday evenings, and as the old resident DJ at the once superior Sound Factory, he has withstood the test of time. Those of you who love this cd, look for his imports, they make this cd seem a bit simple. One of his best compilations is Junior live from Germany and London. He pushes the envelope there as he does for us in this beautiful city.Junior will always keep our city pumping.
Rubbish, through and through: What kind of cognitive dissonance must the author have suffered when Pluto was downgraded from a planet? Her made-up babblings about the connection of the planets to psychology are too goofy for anyone who knows anything about astrology or psychology. At least she is right about astrology being connected to mythology. You can see and hear the author babbling in person on YouTube.There are so many good books on Amazon, it's a shame that space (and paper and ink) would be wasted on this book.
A new way to look at living and your chart: With Saturn as my ruling planet and in a placement in my natal chart that I find rather uncomfortable, I always have found myself living with Saturn as my weakness."My Saturn's in my __ th house, sorry I just can't do that task".Ms. Casey's book offers a new manner of looking at your planets, seeing them not as weaknesses but as opportunities and gives the reader hints on how to find their positive aspects.I highly recommend this book for anyone who has felt controlled by any part of their chart or boxed in to a corner...or worst yet...forever stuck with what you were given natally.
Exquisitely Empowering & Appealing: I love this book:)Caroline is an inspirational Astrologer and author. She creates in this book some wonderful imagery and insights. She offers practical spiritual solutions to the age-old problems of life itself.The book starts with the signs of the Zodiac and then is divided into 'the planets' going backwards from Pluto.I liked the way Caroline adds her quirky experiences around the world, including what happened when she climbed up a Great Pyramid...She adds lots of rituals for various planetary challenges, which I especially enjoyed. You would have to be into the more esoteric side of life to enjoy this book, which for me added to it's charm.Super!
One of my favorites: Caroline Casey's book is not a technical read! And yet... she conveys the intricate pattern of planetary influence with a depth that keeps me coming back to this book. She has stories that include ways of honoring particularly intense transits. For so many, learning astrology is not what they want to do. They want to understand their chart. If you have been told that you are going through a transit and you want more practical information for what that might look like... this is your book. If you are an astrologer... this book brings it back to the fine patterns in the sand that you just do not see in the other - very fine - books designed to break it down by study. What you will not get is a cooking recipe for planet in sign to house.... etc. I find myself coming back, frequently to this book to regain the respect that can be lost in too much study!
SIMPLY INCREDIBLE: I stumbled on truartrecords.com by chance and listened to the album Ceremonies. Got blown away. Ordered it immediately and have made it a mission to tell everyone about it. Although I still hunt for good jazz music I no longer buy new age music simply because it has become so mundane and lacks creativity..until Armen and Ceremonies. The mix of Jazz, New Age and the world sounds in such a perfect harmony is simply magnificent. All my gratitude to Armen for the pleasure and joy we are receiving from this gift, "Ceremonies"
Perfect fit: My kid loves it, he is 12. very easy install, little blurry, but for the money you can't beat it. 50 yards he keeps it in the circle and on the paper.
10-22 ruger scope: did not send the scope shown in the picture and there was no mounting rail included as shown in the picture
NOT COLOR SHOWN COMES BLUE: WAS NOT COLOR SHOWN IN PICTURE PICTURE SHOWS SILVER IT CAME BLUE I HAVE A STAINLESS RIFLE SO CANT USE IT YOU NEED TO CHANGE PICTURE COLOR
color blind: This scope shows as being silver in color, but when it arrived from the seller (The Global Sportsman) it was black in color. A phone call to the seller proved fruitless for customer satisfaction as they insisted the color was black as shown. They agreed to to exchange it for a silver one but I had to return it at my own expense.
10/22 blued scope: Seems to work great all parts were present upon delivery and super easy to install... I'm very happy with the product
Scope: The item fit perfect and delivery of the item was faster than expected. The finish of the product was great and len cleaner and wipe were included with the product which was unexpected.
A Thoughtful Remeberance: Professor Glendon vividly and lucidly elaborates the people and events whose obscure work yielded perhaps the single most important document of the second half of the 20th Century.For those of us who are privileged to live under the blanket of freedom, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights might not be understood to be the beacon of hope and freedom that is has become to many millions around the world who live in conditions of extraordinary disadvantage. This book is a gift in that it provides with a detailed narrative of the places, people, and events which conspired to deliver the UDHR at a moment in history when it was so desperately needed.
Bad Sole: The sole of the my shoe started to wear out only after three days of use. I won't recommend it to anyone.
ok., really tight at the front: for $30, i guess i cant complain but this are not good looking or comfortable shoes
awesome book: I loved this book...i am an MD family doc myself & completely agree with all the scenarios that were presented in this book...very impressed.I even gave it to my friends to read..totally worth it. every woman should have one.
B2K: I just love this B2K CD!It is sooo tight.I know almost all of Lil Fizz's raps.My favorite songs are Im not finished,Fantasy,and Feel This Way.Also,I wanna say LIL FIZZ,I LOVE YOU!
Exceptional CD: I gave the B2k debut 4 stars, because the songs are exceptionally written (thanks to B2K's older "brothers" IMx) and they boys' vocal skills are beautiful. Though there are certain tracks you can choose to skip over during your daily run of the cd, there are enough good songs on this cd to keep any teenager boppin' their head and singing along. Particular tracks that stand out vocally are "Why I Love You", "I'm Not Finished" and "Feel this Way." Even so, tracks such as "Your Girl Chose Me" (though a favorite are mine) and "Here We Go Again" are basically only appreciated by hard core B2K fans. Either way, I recommend this cd very much, because these boys have skills!
I Love you: Dear,B2kWhen I saw you I didn't no what to do. My name is Tekeya and love you your number 1 fan,and it seem like you are a nice sweet mammerable person,and looking for someone.Every boy I go with didn't care about me but you do to all of your fan,when I think about you ,you made me cry. I hope you write me back to show that you really care.I will all ways love you and keeps you in my heart.
Not another boy band.: This boy band is just another ploy of the record company to get money off of naive little girls.This band is as unoriginal as it gets and all the songs sound the same.Absolutely no talent at all and I hope we dont hear from them anymore in the near future.Vote for my review if you feel the same way.
IS IT JUST ME...: Or am I the only one that finds this mess very pedestrian,phony,and tiring.B2K are so obviously scantly-talented urban teen puppets made to scheme off the success of Lil' Bow Wow and otherfuture-washed up kiddie pretenders.This album has no spunk at all.The stiff,vapid "dance" ditty "Uh Huh" and the goofy lyrics of "Gots Ta Be" make you want to shake your head.Remember whenteen acts,whether it be Jackson 5 or New Kids On The Block,actually had talent AND telegenic appeal? Goes to show you what the music buisness is all about these days.I don't know, maybe I haveto be a 12 year old schoolgirl to enjoy it.
It was okay...nothing that outstanding: Not that I was expecting anything spectcular, but I was hoping for something with a little more originality. B2K doesn't do much to separate themselves from regular teen r-n-b boybands that come and go. They're very very handsome and cute (well Omarion and J-Boog) but other than that they don't bring much to the table. The songs are enjoyable, but contradicting. Some material seems too mature for them, while others seems too young. I believe and hope once they find their theme ( and stop letting the annoying lil' fizz say his name on every damn track) they may have something to listen to.
Cute: This album is very good even though the boys of B2k only wrote one song it still is very good. My favorite sing on the album is Undestanding my least favorite is Your girl choose me I think the boys are acting a little too cocky on this track but for the most part I think the album is great.
It's more than 5 stars: This CD is SoOoOoOoOo GOOD!!! I love every song on it. The members all have excelent voices and they're even better in concert! I've been to 2 and goin to my 3rd one on MAy 24th (so u can say I'm a true B2K fan i have 73 posters of them in my room crazy huh??). I think its so good to have singers/role models out there my age that i can relate to and aren't singin about gettin any booty and [junk] like that. If you haven't already got the CD, GO GET IT. Its totally worth it!!!~B2K fan for life
I Don't Get These Cats (corrected version): My 9th grade class enjoyed rewriting one of the reviews of this CD so much because it had more mistakes in it than any of them had ever seen in one paragraph before. I told them their writing was bad, but now they don't feel so bad reading this horrible reviews of this band. So read the corrected version they made:Yeah, I bet you're saying this is another person that hates B2K. No, it isn't even like that, but truthfully, they can't sing. What do you think helped them sell, their nice voices? No, it's the image; that's all the music industry is about. Those cats have the image, so all they have to do is make a few decent songs, and POW! There you go; you made it big. No hating from me although I wish them well and everything, but I'm not a fan. I just think that B2K sells their image, not talent nowadays. This CD really got a zero from me, but I couldn't give it that.
OK MAYBE IT'S NOT SO BAD!!! (2.5 stars): I guess there are some decent songs on B2K's self-titled debut. I obviously liked GOTS TA BE and UH-HUH, but there were some others I liked as well such as I'M NOT FINISHED and COME ON. Overall, I didn't really like the album because there weren't enough slow songs. Most boy bands of the past are known for their slow songs. There were only about three of them!I've never heard "Pandemonium!", but if you buy a B2K album, I suggest buying that one. But if you're a die hard fast song fan, I definitely suggest B2K's debut effort!
Not Feelin' It: What's going on, here? When the Jackson 5 started out, they were subject to RIGOROUS rehersals and nonstop practicing. Nowadays, cookie cutter teen acts like B2K need nothing more than a hype machine, a good stylist, and a flashy video director to help sell a million copies. Maybe these kids need to speak with Michael Jackson, the original child star, about learning to pay your dues before you make it big! This record really upsets me, for they are singing songs that are far beyond their years. Listen, shorties: drop the mike and go to school and complete your education. Pave the way for your future, because this record ain't doin' it.
B2K!!!Boyz of 2002 Best boy group besides IMX: I am here first to tell you that the new B2K c.d. is off the hook!!! I don't even think it is necessary to go through all of the tracks on the album, it would just be better to say that the c.d. as a whole is very good. "Uh huh" is still my favorite song on the c.d., but all the others are very good. If you like IMX, you will LOVE B2K!!! I am a huge fan but I was very judgemental while listening to the c.d., but I like every song on the c.d. The guys are hot, the songs have great beats...I can't tell you how happy I am that the c.d. was what I excepted. This c.d. is worth your money!!!Buy it!!! i luv omarion
This is NOT harmless, bubblegum funk.....: ...because after one listen, it is very, very harmful ! This is truly some of the most atrocious noise I have ever heard, and my eardrums may never heal. This group is soooooo fake, and sooooo bland, heck, they even make NKOTB sound like gritty soul. Who would have thought that these young men could strip down and whitewash an already wobbly R&B scene, but, by george, they did just that. Pitiful. Boy Bands be gone !!!!
what up ?: hi my name is vanessa and i think that u guys got the best group around and people all ways got something to about this nice group.i love u omarion ,j bogg,raz b,lil fizz
B2K Is SOOO Coolz:): B2K Album is just soo TIGHT! I loved it when I got it I was soo excited,believe me you guys should really get it,I mean I love mostly all the songs,my fav hip hop kinda type one is "Your Girl Chose Me",my fav ballet song is "Babygirl" I listen to it like everynight before I go to bed,I have a CD player and I bring it around in school, like when I walk home I listen to it,and when I be ridin in the car with my mom,I listen to it,I mean I KNOW the whole CD now,and just got it like in March,its very addictive,so I just tell ya get it,and you will enjoy it,and considering Im such a BIG B2k fan,I know alot about them,I can't wait to the next single get out,which will be "Thats The Reason Why I love You"(I heard Raz On V103 say that(lol),soo get it!:)Daphne(aka)Lil'FizzFan

Boyz II Men for the future? I hope not!: Overly-produced, utterly mainstream schlock that all the young impressionable hip-pop fans will just love. Sure, get street cred, lose artistic ability just to please the masses. This is what is wrong with the music industry. Music is art, not just entertainment. This is schlock.
b2k: b2k r the most fittest boy band around there the new boys 2 men, and my god can they sing,uh huh is so gr8 and so is gotsta b,they can sing, dance and can make the girls melt.keep it goin ladz
Careless editing spoils a potentially interesting storyline: Despite Kavanagh's credentials in the author notes, CAPABLE OF MURDER is poorly plotted with numerous misspellings and thousands of unneeded adverbs and adjectives that any student writer would know better than to use. Either the writer is careless or the editor was unqualified. This book reads like a badly written romance novel and lacks cohesion. Suddenly the heroine is driving a car in a rain storm but the reader is never told how she came to have a car. This will teach me never to buy a book by this author or this publisher again.
Shake it up: My Sheltie has been enjoying Vita-Derm for years! The one thing I've learned is that you MUST shake the bottle like a paint can, because the ingredients separate. I even store it sideways. Also, I was told by several retailers to STOCK UP. It's being discontinued.
Great addition to Helping our Dog's Allergy / Itch problem.: Vita derm is a very easy to use product, just measure ... poor and mix into your dog's food.We have a Rat Terrier with Addison's disease as well as numerous allergies. My wife has been a professional dog groomer for the past 15+ years and works with a number of vets. Needless to say after years of trying this and that product, it seems in our opinion that the line of Vet's Best products seem to work the best and last the longest for our dogs allergy irritations / redness / itching / scratching & bitting. The added bonus that the shampoo as well as the spray leave your dog with the pleasant tea tree smell, instead of some flowery cover up type of perfume is great.We highly recommend these lines of product!Vet's Best Seasonal Allergy Support Supplement for Dogs, 60 TabletsVet's Best Hot Spot Shampoo, 16-OunceVet?s Best Vita-Derm Healthy Skin and Coat Supplement for Dogs, 16-OunceVet's Best Hot Spot Spray, 16 oz.
omega 3: Vets best vitaderm is the second bottle I ordered, the first one I purchased at a local store and liked that it helped my bichon, the first bottle was called something different but it was the same ingredients, when i ordered it I thought thats what i was getting and its the same stuff just has same names. at any rate it works well to help her dry skin. lasts a long time its like an oil texture.
A big disappointment.: I received this "locket" in the mail yesterday. It is teeny-tiny and gold filled. I believe I paid $55.00 + shipping for a piece of cheesy costume jewelry, that used to be available in a Five & Ten store. I was hoping this gift would become an heirloom that she could pass down to her own little girl. I am afraid it is a piece of junk. It would behoove the vender to say in the ad that it is gold filled. The locket is so miniscule that I can't imagine any photo or piece of a photo fitting in it. Quel dommage!!!
NOT THE BEST BAG!: The Lansinoh bags worked better for me. They are designed with a ziplock closure method vs the twist tie Medela method. They store flat and thaw much faster in the refrigerator than the Medela bags. I have also had concerns over the use of unsanitary scissors to open the Medela bags and have experienced leaks. I have been pleased with the Lansinoh bags.
reliable bags: I bought these bags with the medulla pump in style. I found them very simple to use and have never had one leak. I don't understand why people complain that they do not stand up. Why do they need to stand up? After defrosting you transfer them to a bottle anyway. I have never been able to get one to tear (for pouring ) but I just use scissors. And the twist tie feature is as simple as tying up your bread bag.
Not worth it: I really liked the Medela products at first, but I never really liked these bags, mainly because you have to tie them with a folded over twist tie to close them. If you get too much milk in the bag, it will leak when you close it up. Then one of my bags tipped over in the freezer and it leaked, causing a frozen puddle of breast milk in my brand new freezer to clean. Plus, the bag got stuck in the puddle.I have also used the Gerber bags, and I liked those much better.
Don't waste your money: These bags are horrible. I didn't really like the way it closes, it is so easy for the milk to spill out and I can't afford for that to happen after pumping for so long. Another thing is that it can't stand by itself, doesn't have a handle to hold while pouring the milk into the bottle and I hate the way the way the milk has to be emptied from the bag. It just didn't work for me. I prefer first years storage bags because they have zip locks, a handle to hold while pouring and it can stand by itself. Another plus with these bags is that I ziplock the bags right over my pis advanced and pump right into it. You don't need these medela sucky bags to do that.It makes no sense to cry over spilt milk
What? Puncture resistant?: I didn't actually purchase these but got I think 25 of them free with my Medela Pump In Style. Love the pump, hated the bags. I've had a few of them come with holes in them. As we all know breastmilk is liquid gold, so these baggies cost me precious milk. Now I just pump into the provided bottles--which I mainly use for storage--then use Gerber freezer bags for freezer storage. The Gerber bags are self-standing and they have a zipper seal, which is so much better than fooling with those stupid twist ties that the Medela bags use. Bottles are much easier to attach to your pump. I hate to say anything bad about Medela, but I wouldn't recommend spending actual money on these by themselves.
Prefer Lansinoh: I registered for and received these Medela bags. After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase. Wow!! I will never go back to Medela. The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak. Well this is the only good feature. The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top. With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that. My medela bags haven't split in the freezer...I'll give them that. But neither has my Lansinoh bag.
Buy the Gerber bags!: Why on earth would you want to fuss with twist ties when you can just zip up the Gerber bags? The Gerber bags also stand up on their own and you can freeze them flat, which optimizes storage space. I've never had one leak.
A one star review gives this product too much credit.: I initially tried these bags because all my other experiences with Medela products were great. However, Medela missed the mark on this one. The twist tie bag closure design is horrible and more expensive compared to other brands.I decided to go with the Gerber storage bags instead and I like them 100% better. I have never had a problem freezing any milk with the Gerber bags and thawing the milk is easy using the sealed pouch design, we use the coffee maker and the bags hold up well immersed in just the hot water. The Gerber bags are sold everywhere and you get more for your money per bag.
Medela needs to come up w/ something else: I think that I've tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them. These were just about the worst!! My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding. I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped. I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day. I went through ALOT of bags (I use bottles now) and these were a pain. They were small, thin, punctured easily, and those twist ties (although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept) were just a pain in the butt. I love Medela's pumps (I own the Pump in Style Advanced, a seperate manual pump, and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months), I like their storage bottles, I even like their nipple cream, but these bags need some more work put into them.
Hard to use: I personally preferred the Lansinoh bags, they seem more sanitary, are easier to write on and close easier. These weren't bad, I just found something better!
Leaky!: About half the bags that I stored in my freezer cracked and leaked, wasting milk that I had painstakingly collected before I went back to work. I wish I'd used the Avent cup system or the Gerber or Lansinoh zipper bags from the beginning instead. Also, I tried pumping directly into the bags, but the twist ties were leaky, and it made a mess. Medela makes a lot of good products, but this isn't one of them!!!
Pump into a bottle instead and pour into a separate bag: These bags are not only expensive but they are an exercise in frustration. The tearing feature doesn't work and you always use scissors which is a pain (and introduces germs unnecessarily). The twist tie method to seal the bags for storage is awkward at best. If you do pump directly into them be careful how you handle all the pump accessories after you pump(it is quite a balancing act) because you can't set these down anywhere after you pump so you have to balance the bag+ shield in one hand and try to put everything else away- If you set down the bag you will spill all your precious milk. I have tried all the bags and would recommend staying away from Gerber (too thin and get freezer burn) and the Medela bags. I personally like the Lansinoh bags the best, the double ziplock at the top ensures the milk is airtight.
Clumsy design, hard to use: These bags leave a lot to be desired. They don't stand up on their own so you have to set them in a cup when they have milk in them. They don't lie down flat, so you can't freeze them in a nice flat layer to stack in the freezer. The twist-tie top causes the bags to freeze with a lot of folds and ridges at the neck - this made it impossible for me to open a frozen bag to add more milk later on. And I've never been able to tear open the little tab at the bottom to get the milk out - I have to snip the edge with a scissors, which I'm sure defeats the purpose of having a nice, sterile inside. All in all, I'm really disappointed in these bags, and the only positive side to them is I haven't had any burst in the freezer...yet.
Absolute Mess: If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you. First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself. Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out. It's not that easy. The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk. Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there. The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk. This never happened with the other bags on the market. My favorite is lansinoh. Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others. Pass on this and try others.
Too cumbersome: The idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them. The execution, however, is lousy. Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying.I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal. Even though you can't pump straight into them, sealing them is quick and easy.
Not impressed: I was not impressed with these storage bags. I prefer to use the other brands that offer ziplock type closure. This brand is harder to close, more time consuming and wasteful (due to spilling)
Prefer Gerber bags: After using both these bags and the Gerber bags, I prefer the zipper-style closure of the Gerber bags. I've never had a problem with those leaking or ruining my milk. They are also much cheaper as you can generally find them at discount stores (Target, etc.).
Sour Milk; Devastated Mom: These bags seemed perfect, as I was unable to breastfeed my son and was pumping full-time for him. Sometimes I would have extra milk at the end of the day, so I froze it using these bags and also some Avent freezer bags that I had. Once I stopped breastfeeding, I went to use the frozen milk that was remaining in the freezer (I had been using it up slowly as I decreased my milk supply, so none of the milk was in there longer than 2 or 3 months), and to my dismay 90% of the milk in the medela bags was complelety sour. The Avent bags, though they didn't fit on my Lactina pump, worked for 100% of the milk I stored. Don't waste your money and effort on these bags. You may be sorry.
Most expensive and least useful: I started off with the Medela bags but one day they fell to the side and spilled 13 oz of milk in the little black carrier and into my work bag. Then I moved onto the Gerber ones with zip lock but were not spill-proof either. Then tried the Lansinoh which have a double zip lock system and those can be carried upside down and not a drop is lost. Also cheaper than Medela.
Horrible bags! They always leak and are hard to handle.: This is a horrible system! The picture on the package shows them using some kind of screw top on the top of the bag, but that's misleading. There is no such thing in the package. The package consists of nothing but the bags and wire twist ties. In order to use the bags, you have to peel open their top seal, which leaves the entire top open and unsealed! You are then supposed to use the wire ties to close the bag. Well, I don't think that's all that great! Once they have milk in them they are very awkward to handle because the don't stand up due to the "convenient" spout on the bottom. The spout doesn't actually tear open either, you have to cut it with scissors, which means, if you're not fast enough to pull your scissors back, then the milk will run over them. And if you don't hold them upright, then the milk will start to leak out of the top that's basically open except for the little wire tie. Bad design! I'd never buy those again.
Didn't like - Used First Years bags or Mother's Milk bottles: I had some of these that came with my Medela pump and like some other reviewers I thought they would be a good deal since I've really liked my Medela pump. I really didn't like using them with the twist ties. That didn't make sense to me at all. I tried the First Years that have a zip-loc top and they've worked better. They sit on their own and don't need to be set in a cup!I do prefer using bottles to store milk and have found the Mother's Milk Mate storage bottles to be a great cheap alternative for storage bottles.
CSF Breastmilk Bags: I cannot believe that, in this day and age, no one has come up with a better method for pumping and storing breast milk! As a resident physician, I pumped 3 to 5 times daily for 8 months and was always amazed that this was really the only way. Must the pump be so big, so loud? Has anyone with BREASTS ever looked at the design of the bulky plastic suction cups, the tubing, the hilarity of the 1960's design? I suppose that I must discuss the bags, although anyone who has spent a half-hour pumping only to spill the precious contents during the uncap, transfer, recap, wire-threading, de-airing, or closing phase knows what I'm talking about. Best of luck to you out there who plan to undertake this noble cause. I hope that somewhere there is a person out there who will come up with a better, more usable design.
OKAY FOR EMERGENCIES: I bought these bags thinking that I would be using them alot but I only found myself using them when I did not have any more bottles left. I didn't really like them because when I pour the milk out, I notice that I don't get everything out so easily. I keep extra bags in my car, at work or in my bag in case I forget to pack a bottle or I run out and I need something to store my breast milk. But that hardly ever happens because I definately prefer storing milk in the bottles.
So easy... and NO LEAKS!!!: We were using bottles to store milk when my mother bought these. I was SOOO skeptical at first, but I tried them. LOVE EM!!! I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars b/c they are a little bit akward to put on the pumps, but I love them!!! they save space and they are less expensive than buying 50 bottles to store your milk in.
Excellent value: These storage bags are convenient to use and reasonably priced -- plus delivered to my front door. Very eay to use with the medela pump-in-style.
Terrible storage bags: I love my Medela Pump In Style but their breastmilk storage bags are awful. The twist-tie closure is complicated. They also spill milk easily when pouring into a bottle after thawing. I recommend the Lansinoh bags. They have an easy-to-use double zip closure to ensure that the milk will stay fresh and it's very easy to get the air out of the bag before closing. You can also lay them flat to freeze so they won't take up much space in the freezer. They pour great - no spills!
Found these bags difficult although milk freezed well: I had been using the lansinoh milk storage bags and ran out so I tried these bags. I found them very hard to use. The Lansinoh bags have a zip top like the gerber bags yet I have not had a problem with them leaking. I was very dissappointed in these bags since you have to place them in a cup and they are awkward and don't lay flat when frozen. I have a supply of milk in my freezer and if I couldn't lay them flat I would have no room for my other freezer items. I was extremely happy with the lansinoh bags and would reccommend them instead of these.
They leak!: As a mom whose son was breastfed but not able to nurse, these bags were the bane of my existence! They were not easy to use and leaked horribly. Even if they managed to hold together long enough to be put in the freezer or refrigerator, they almost always began leaking while being thawed.I personally LOVED the Lansinoh bags from Target. They're cheaper and easier to use.
Nothing like having your milk leak all over your fridge: I had been using the Gerber bags for quite a while when I ran out and decided to try some of the Medela bags that came with my pump.I frequently just couldn't seem to get the bags to completely seal - and I had NEVER had this problem with the Gerber bags.I always ended up making a mess when trying to use the 'spout' at the bottom of the bag.And the worst part - I didn't realize the twist-ties were cutting into the sides of the bags on more than one occasion. I took the bag out of the freezer and into the fridge to thaw and ended up with a shelf full of breastmilk.Maybe these bags work for supermoms, but they didn't work well for busy, sloppy me. Apparently I can handle a ziploc baggie but not a twist tie!
Love These Bags...: After trying several breast-milk storage systems, I have found these bags to be one of the best. I have never had any problems with leaks or freezer burn. I agree with the reviewer who said that it is better to pour the thawed milk from the top where the twist tie is than from the bottom (where the directions indicate you should pour from). I found it too difficult to pour from the bottom. I would highly recommend these bags to any breast feeding mommy.
horrible bags: This bags are absolutelly horrible they don't close right, I have already spilled milk all over and also if you keep them in the freezer or fridge nothing guarantees you that the milk is going to be sterile since the bag does not close properly and does not use a zipper. I found that Lansinoh breatmilk storage bags are way better they come with a double zipper that seals the bag for extra security, don't waste your money on these bags.
Medela vs. Lasinoh: The Lasinoh bags have a double ziplock and are cheaper too. Also you can find Lasinoh bags at more stores such as K-Mart, etc. The twist ties with the Medela bags are a pain and I never used them to pump in anyway.
Not the best on the market: While these are easy to use when you are pumping, they tie on the pumps nice and snug, they are not the best for storing. The tie doesn't make it leakproof and there can be spillage if they tip before they freeze.A better bag is the Gerber seal and go bag. They fit on the pump but you'll need to either hold the bag so it doesn't slip or use a rubberband to hold it in place. But, the reason it's better is because it's a ziplock bag. So, it seals tight and there's no spilling. The best part about these bags is if you freeze them, you can store them in the freezer lying down so you can have thin bags stacked up, keeping room in your freezer for food for the rest of the family.
Bags Leak: These bags leaked for me from both the top and the bottom. The fold-down mechanism is very cumbersome especially because the plastic is very stiff. I lost three bags of milk due to leaks. If you have to transport the bags anywhere, like back and forth to work like I do, I would avoid these bags. They just leaked all over the place for me, even after I carefully re-sealed each one exactly according to the package instructions. I would recommend the Lanisoh bags over these.
Only good if you use Medela Pump: Initially I was renting a Medela pump from the hospital and I was attaching the bags to the pupm. (Although it was confusing at first to figure out HOW to attach the bags w/o the milk spilling after the pumping session.) But when I purchased another pump (Evenflo Comfort Select Dual- Awesome pump for a 1/4 of the price of the medela) closing the bags was a PAIN! I now use the Lansihoh bags with the double zipper seal.
Not easy to use: I've used the Gerber, Lansinoh and these CSF bags and I have to say that the CSF are the worst. The twist-tie method really does stink. Lansinoh is much more sturdier, easier to pour milk into and the double ziploc action is great. Plus the thickness of the bags is better. The CSF bags don't stand up on their own so you need a cup to keep them upright while you fold the bag over the twist ties, ugh..I can't be bothered. And the whole cutting of the bag on the bottom, what a pain. Isn't it easier to just open up a ziploc-type Lansinoh bag and pour it into the bottle?
Horrible: This product is horrible. I bought these bags thinking that pumping directly into the bag would be great. I have experienced sour milk, leaks, and spills and they were not convenient. Use the Lansinoh bags, they are by far the best!
works fine for me: I have a full time job and I pump 3 times at work. Yes, you have to do some setting up for the liners, such as the twist tie, but after about a week, it only takes less than a minute to do. After your done you just seal it up. I haven't had any leaks. you do have to be careful when you are pouring it into the bottle as the stream of milk can miss the opening, but after the first spill you can figure out the right way to do it.I think these are great as they take up less space than bottles. I bring home 6 bags everyday and that would be too many bottles to handle. If you have any questions just email me. I love these bags.
Gerber Vs. Medela? I vote Gerber: I've tried lots of storage bags, and by far the Medela ranks the lowest. These spill, you have to store them upright in the freezer...and if your freezer is as compact as mine with food to feed five people, storing milk upright is just too hard to do. These bags do NOT have a ziplock seal on them, which means that they are leaky and unreliable if you are in a hurry (like if you have more than one kid and you work).Buy the Gerber or the Lansinoh bags with the zip seals on them. They can both be stored flat for more convenience, and they can stand on their own. Pumping into a bag is fine if you are someone who wants to fumble with attaching it to the pump (the Medela bags), or you can use your Medela pump with your reliable pump kit and pour your milk into a Gerber or Lansinoh storage bag for ease. I use the Medela Lactina Plus, and I find that this method works the best for me. Simple, clean and easy.
The milk tasted awful!: I used these bags to store several gallons of milk over the past few months. I had to throw all the milk away because when I used the previously frozen milk to make cereal and tasted it,the milk tasted awful. I felt horrible because I had unknowingly fed this milk to my son several times. I don't know if the milk tasted bad because the bags don't seal correctly because of the twist ties, or because the plastic makes it taste bad but something wrong happened. I wouldn't recommend these bags to anybody. I would recommend tasting frozen milk before feeding it to your baby. I also recommend the Gerber bags because they are cheaper and keep the milk fresher.
not easy to use: I bought these to store milk before I went back to work. They work fine when I'm home with all the time in the world. I've back to work for 4 days and find these bags very time consuming...opening the bag, threading the twist tie, attaching it to the shield, pumping, deattaching it, and closing it. Pumping can take up to 25 minutes. Not something that can happen 2-3 times a day. And I'm never sure how much I've pumped. When the bag is attached to the shield it says 1 thing, but then you seal it up and it says anothers. Today, I'm going to buy bottle set. They close just as tight and are much easier to use.
Another, better option-Pumpmate breastmilk storage liners: My sister-in-law swore by Medela bags and they worked for her, however, we looked at them in stores and saw how they were to be used, and decided against them. I think that these and other bags like them are more complicated than they need to be.We have been using Pumpmate storage liners and found them to be much easier and simpler to use. They are shaped like playtex disposable drop-in liners and the starter kit comes with a screw-on adapter to use with your pump so you can pump directly into the liners. (You can also use it to pump directly into a playtex disposable nurser with a drop-in liner for fresh milk) It's as easy as pumping into a collection bottle. You can then seal it, freeze, thaw and feed directly from the same bag! No pouring involved!The Pumpmate liners are comprably priced to Medela bags and are so much easier and simpler to use!
Twist ties??: I find these bags really hard to use. Sure it's great you can pump right into them, BUT they don't stand up on their own and the twist tie closures are REALLY hard to use. I've used (and highly recommend) Lansinoh bags which work really well.
Terrible product for milk storage: I started using these bags that came with my Pump in Style pump and HATED THEM. I feel like writing Medula and telling them they need to rethink their design. They expect you to be able to attach the bags to the pump things with a twist tie and then manipulate them without getting milk all over. The instructions actually say to prop them up in a cup or something to prevent from leaking??? Im sorry but pumping is a chore in itself and there is nothing worse than opening your freezer to LEAKED milk that you painstakingly gathered. Try the Gerber brand bags..they have a neat zip lock top and you can safely stack them on top of each other in the freezer!!
Not a Big Fan: I had received these with my pump and although it may be nice to use them I found buying the bottles that fit on the end of the pump much easier and then i could combine the milk and place it in a storage container for the fridge or freezer. Also I am not one to spend money needlessly so instead of buying all of these expensive storage containers I found the Avent Via and just cheap gerber bottles with disks on the top the best and cheapest way to store breastmilk. And it helps if you intend on having a huge supply stored.
Well made and awesome: This is a well made piece of necessary body building machinery. Back, triceps, etc. The more clever you get, the better this piece works. Price is right on and even better if you have a prime membership.
Don't waste your money: I bought this for my son for Christmas as an alternative to the overpriced Transformers ... what a disappointment. The pieces are difficult to put together and don't stay together. The water has to be just the right temperature for it to change colors. And the color changing spots are just that - spots on the hood, the fenders, and the doors. I learned my lesson and should have stuck with the original Hot Wheels "type" cars.
5 yr old son loves it: Santa brought this one for Christmas and all the other toys have been cast aside. My son has been playing constantly with it for several days now.It does take a little coordination to "transform" this toy from a car to a robot, and my son often needs a little help. He is not quite 5. He does not mind and loves to play with the water squirters.The color change feature that is supposed to activate with cold water is not very effective. We used very cold ice water to fill the guns and drenched the spot that was supposed to change color. The change was barely noticable and very short lived. I don't think the little water guns vend enough water to cool to the required temperature to cause the paint to change.The doors pop off often when playing with the toy as a robot or when transforming from a car into a robot, but can be popped back on without damaging the toy.
Two Stars Seems Appropriate: Yes, this is a cartoon book about breasts. There are no actual photographs, the cartoons are reminiscent of cave drawings, and the text is somewhat stilted (perhaps it's the translation) and often hilarious (whether intentional or not). For those who don't know (and I hope this isn't considered a "spoiler"), breasts (at least the female version) are useful--particularly for babies. Lots of babies get milk from a mamma's breast and this book covers the process nicely and with simple words and (even simpler) drawings. If you want to teach a young child about breasts, this may be the book for you.
I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!: This book is great, and my kids love it. My children were breastfeed to at least age 1. It is an act of nature, so get over it people! I choose to feed my children the natural way rather than feed them some man made crap. This book shows and teachs even the youngest child about our bodies and what the different parts are used for. I love the whole series and applaude the writer for giving us these wonderful books about topics most find taboo.
Interesting but limited: Despite many facts updating Thomas Verny's The Secret Life of the Unborn Child, an expectant parent finishes this book saying,"So what?" All the data does really not provide a useful direction for its evidence that the fetus is capable of learning. However, I found that my two children vastly benefitted from the prenatal enrichment system described by Dr. Sarah Brewer in her recent book, Super Baby, with its compelling documentation for the product called BabyPlus (see [...]), which as a nurse I would urge that parents-to-be consider.
Functional and awesome server rack: I purchased this item for the IT department so they could mount all of the servers in one place. Since we just got it installed, it has been "like a dream" for my network admin, this rack system works perfectly for all their needs, and it looks pretty darn good at the same time.From my own experience, Versa Tables is a great company to work with, and I will definitely purchase their products again for personal needs or work related.
carlos_anaheim@hotmail.com: are you looking for a free zone dvd?DONT BUY THIS ONEONLY PLAY REGION 1!!!!!
Infectious grooves that can bring the jaded to life.: Absolutely one of the year's best albums, dance/techno or otherwise. The beats are furious and the music joyful in its exhuberance. The guest artists only heighten the overall mood of this album. Someone get these guys to score a film!
Great CD: You know it's wierd, I'm a jazz fan, and up until recently I don't think I would have ever even thought of buying a CD like this, but hey...I guess people change. Propllerheads are great-they have a nice sense of groove, and also I have to admit, quite a sense of humor. They combine alot of funky basslines with old spy themes from James Bond movies, and the result is actually very inventive. It's obvious that they have many different musical influences: reggae, jazz, rap, funk.... All in all a fun and creative new album, the songs can get a little bit anoying sometimes, but after a while, it'll really begin to grow on you.
This CD is awsome: My friend let me borrow the CD the other day and I had to buy it. My favorite track is "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", I like how they start with the stereo effects going back and forth and as the song goes along, you realize that it's the James Bond theme song, after a while it's all fast and danceable then it slows and softens down and then once you think it's over you hear this awsome bass guitar line and it's get sweet and so on and so on. I also like spybreak, (from the matrix) which also has some sweet bass guitar lines which make me want to learn bass guitar just to play those parts.
super cool: What an excellent CD. After originally buying this for Take California, I was quite impressed by the other tracks as well. The beats are great and don't get annoying/repetitive like so much of techno does. The only song I don't really enjoy is Bang On, it's just a little too crazy for me. Anywho buy the album it rocks!
Not worth it: I'm sorry fans, but I found the CD to be monotonous and lacking in any visible signs of musical talent. I have read comments stating that it's good background music, not exactly meant to be 'listened' to -- and that's from a fan. He went on to say, you know, it's for clubs, implying that the standards for its quality not be as high. Thank you again -- helping me make my point.I did like Velvet Pants I admit, but think it's absurd that this CD gets about 80 reviews, mostly positive, while the immensely more talented Doves get only about 30 reviews on "Lost Souls."Anyway, I admit dance/funk/electronica/hip-hop (sounds like an identity crisis) is not my bag but I gave it an honest listen. I would wholeheartedly recommend the first 5 albums by the Stranglers, Alex Gifford's former band instead.
This one bites!: After reading all the raving reviews I decided to go out and buy this album. Man o' man the tracks on here could be mistaken for elevator music! Too much repetition and not a single track stood out. I take that back, Jag is using "History Repeating" in its commercials. What a joke.
My feelings on this CD.: I would like to get started, and say one thing; I did not buy this CD on amazon.com, but I have listened to the whole cd. I first heard it shortly after it came out, after my friends were raving about it. Frankly, I was not impressed. It was one of the very few times I have raised the question, is the whole world on mind-altering substances? Quite too frequently I hear people complaining about elevator music. In my opinion this is so close to elevator music, it is scary. Sadly, my friends who made me listen to this CD also hate elevator music. I am a fan of The Chemical Brothers, Prodigy, and Crystal Method. I was shocked to find that quite a few people who bought the Crystal Method CD also bought this CD. I do not think that Crystal Method and Propellerheads sound alike.
Not the Chemical Brothers: Although "Take California," "Bang On," "On Her Majesty's Secret Service," and "Spybreak" are all very good tracks, especially for dancing, this cd is not very good as a whole. The music is very repetitive, and not fit for repeat listening. Once you get to "History Repeating" you look at the irony in the name of the song, because history, and beats, have been repeating for a very long time. Although the album on a whole isn't very good, "A Number of Microphones" is awesome and made me want to beatbox, it is a fabulous piece of work in that field. If you want to dance a lot for a long time, then buy this album. If you want good music to dance to for a long time, look elsewhere.
LETDOWN!!: Basically, just download "Take California", "History Repeating" and "Spybreak!". Otherwise, this disk is as repetitive and unoriginal as the latest from Britney Spears.
The best album I've heard in a long time: This album is sweet. Some songs like track 9 are long and interesting, while, track 8 is under a minute and very amusing! If you like TAKE CALIFORNIA, pick up the single, it's got a remix with the Jungle Bros. that just kicks!
Very good music. Good composition, performance and variety.: Personally I like this CD very much. I think it's one of the best I've bought this year. I've been making a concious effort not to listen to this CD too often. I _don't_ want to get tired of it.
Propellerheads bust it out once again!: For anyone who hates music like the Backstreet Boys or N'Sync, this is the CD to buy. They tear it up all the way from Take California to On Her Majesty's Secret Service. A Number of Microphones shows that they know how to scratch it up right. If you liked Bang On, buy this now!!!!
Freessshhhhh: One of the freshest albums that I've heard in a long time, owing partly to its distinctivty, but perhaps more importantly due to the fact that genuine thinking has gone into the composition of the lyrics. Superb all round album.
Some rap, some jazz, some techno funk = one snazzy disc: I bought this CD, as I'm so apt to do with most of my music purchases, off of the strength of one song--"History Repeating" featuring Miss Shirley Bassey. From the first track--titled "Take California"--I realized that I'd glommed onto a very different CD.Instead of calling the compositions on the CD techno or any other variation on that theme, I'd like to think that DECKSANDDRUMSANDROCKANDROLL may be what Jazz is headed for in the millenium. It's definitely unlike any of the other music in my collection.I found it to be an immensely satisfying listen and it'll get more than a few spins during my commute. In fact, I think that it just may be the soundtrack to my summer of 1998!
That's was a long time that i looking for and i find it: Very good electronical music with a few several pist generic of james bond.A very good experience. That was a long time that m' looking for.
What do you get when you cross Techno and 50's Jazz??: The Propellerheads! This is one of the best tech. discs in my collection. Buy it, you won't believe your ears. The mix of jazz and techno is unbelievable. I love this album
Original, World Class: I think this album is excellent. It has a nice variety of uniquely propellerheads sounds. Skillfully chosen and eloquently placed and samples. Too many favorites to name. Body-movin on some, trancy on others. Turn yourself on!
A Little Bit of Everything: I lent this cd to a friend to give it a listen and I didn't get it back for 6 months. I think that sums up the quality of the songs on the disc. It is a healthy mix of breakbeat, funk, techno, and jazz. The drums are real, played on a drums set, and the rythems will blow your mind. It sounds like a soundtrack to an amazing film, but the film hasn't been made yet. If you like electronic music with a funky feel you'll really enjoy this album.
Makes my day better... EVERYTIME!: This is gooooood music! I have been listening to this for years and it never gets old!It gets you going and makes you happy! (warning: if you don't like driving fast don't put this in your car - it's a much better workout/morning alarm/be happy thing)You might have heard some of this from the Matrix movie in those slow/fluid/powerful/raw action scenes.I like many kinds of good music, from Ella Fitzgerald to Alice in Chains (Dirt), to Evanessence, and back around to Gershwin, so whatever your taste is just close your eyes, buy this, take that leap and you'll never look back.
A must-read for industry buffs, but not for everybody.: Excellent, casual writing style. Great stories of the Zanucks and others, their gut-based and fact-less decision making and egos. An easy read on that quick plane trip from Hollywood to your Napa hideaway.
Reflections on a golden studio: Although a little dated (originally written circa 1969) this is still one of the great inside stories about what goes on (or more precisely did go on) in the old Hollywood. Written about the time that the old studio system finally collapsed, it collects some great anecdotes for film buffs. Besides, it is well written.
Very quick transaction.: The product was exactly as depicted and arrived very quickly. I was quite pleased with the whole transaction.
You can do better for the price: This camera has relatively low quality. The software bundled with it it nearly useless. I have had nonstop problems with keeping the thing running. Maybe other people have had more luck. At this point I have given up on the mobile camera function entirely.
quick mixing and banging beats: If you like Bill's quick tracks and amazing voice overs vol. 3 is what you want. Bill manages to fit almost all the cd into the first track, by changing and mixing beats in and out like few other house djs can. the cd starts out hard and slowly progresses to a funky house and then Bills last ten tracks make you want to get up and jack your body. The music and artists Bill uses are more old school when compared to Bangin the Box vol.4 If you like Bad boy bill or even if you dont know his beats this is a great addition to any collection of music.
The Best So Far: Bad Boy Bill continues to rip up the scene with Bangin The Box Vol. 3. He Can't Be stopped!!!
Oriole attractor: Love this oriole feeder. Have had 2 of them. The feeder holes keep the bees and ants out. Easy to clean.Only problem is it fades bad after 1-2 summers (Minnesota summer is only 4 1/2 months long). :(
Oriole Feeder: I am sorry to say that this feeder was a waste of money. Orioles were attacted to my yard via hummingbird feeders. Unfortunately, the hummingbird feeders attracted bees....lots of bees! I ordered different hummingbird feeder which worked in keeping bees away and keeping hummingbirds visiting feeders. I ordered this oriole feeder in hopes of keeping these beautiful birds coming to my yard and eliminating bee problem. Even though this product has bee guards, bees were attacted to it. It appears when the oriole feed on nector, the nector got on the bee guards thus attracting lots of bees. Had to take it down and unfortunately lost the orioles coming to my yard.
Not the same: Since the product I received was not the same as the picture, I can't really review it. The one I got is almost the same but the bee guards are little spring loaded buttons that almost cover the feeding hole. I say almost because the button leave a space that allows bees to get to the nectar. I finally had to take the feeder down because it would be completely covered with bees and a nuisance around the patio area. If ever a feeder with a "real" bee guard is manufactured I'll be the first in line to buy it. As for the one I got, I give it a thumbs down.
Not recommended: I used this feeder for three months and the hooded orioles were happy with it. They figured out the bee guard quickly. Other visitors were chestnut backed chickadees and humming birds who came to lick the nectar at the seams where the two part base is screwed together and lick the droplets clinging to the base.The tab on the top of the container prevents it from sitting flat on the counter for filling, so put it into a bowel upside down. Cleaning is easy, just fill it with a weak solution of bleach.I found that the best way to tighten the container and two part base is to screw them together upside down. Screw the top half of the base to the container and then screw on the bottom half of the base so you can press your thumb against the knuckle of the perch hinges. Getting it tight may be difficult for those with arthritis or weak wrists.A product that's designed to hold water and leaks rates only one star. I may buy a different feeder for next summer's orioles.
Bad Product: This thing leaked everywhere, not at first, but gradually over a couple of weeks, it drained itself dry.Couldn't get it to stop leaking, thought about returning it, I just got frustrated and trashed it.The reason for 1 star,I did see 1 Oriole trying to use it, but just once, I never saw another one.I wouldn't recommend this product
Not the best feeder anymore: Bought one of these feeders three years ago, worked super great so much easier than my last one, Loved it so much and so did the birds I bought a new one last week for my front yard, unfortunately dropped and broke my old one so I had to get another this week to replace it. For some reason where the pieces screw together at the base for easy cleaning leaks and the feeder is empty by morning. Both of them. It needs some sort of seal I would think. This is getting really expensive replacing feed every morning so I am going to look for another feeder.. Did not have this problem with the old one and it looked like it was the same design that's what is so funny about it.. I would look for another also, do not get this one until they fix what the problem is. You know when two will leak then they all will..
Bad in hot weather! (oriole feeder): Not good!!!! it seems to work great as long as the air is cool or the lig. is cold as soon as you either put warm liq. in it or the sun hits the liq. it will all drain out. I think I would return it if it was not for it being a gift and I have no reciept. Thank you, Donna
CLEANING PROBLEM: This Perky-Pet Opus Plus (449-2) product's design is a combination of good and bad (personally). I really like the way the base feeder looks and feel (solid), in fact the Orchard Oriole we have in the backyard prefer to feed on this in comparison with the Fliteline Junior (link below) which I also purchased. It allows them to freely move around the frame when selecting a hole.Here is the bad design!!! It is important to keep the feeder clean at all times... This feeder does not allow easy access for clean-up. Buyer, please be aware, this product needs to be re-design, and purchasing this as-is, is a waste of your hard earned $$$.Try the Fliteline Junior instead, if you care about a clean feeder on re-fills, while Opus Plus manufacturer make the needed improvement on their design!Fliteline Junior [...]
Problems with design: I purchased this oriole feeder, and when I used it the first time, I realized that the design of the upper part (that holds the nectar) caused a few problems. It has a very small opening where you fill it...so plan on using a small funnel. That's not a big deal. However....when it comes time to clean that part, it is an impossible task. If the fill opening were big enough to use a bottle brush to clean, and larger to make filling easier, it would be a good oriole feeder.
best oriole feeder I have ever found: I have used dozens of these feeders over many years. They work very well. However, I wish that the plastic was more durable, that the color held up longer and that they were easier to clean. So, I like these feeders. With these changes, I would love these feeders.Margaret Marshall
Scares the orioles! Waste of money.: I was so excited to give my orioles their own feeder so they would leave my hummingbird feeders alone. This Opus feeder has ports that have plastic springs behind them to open up. Since the ports would move a little to open, it would terrify my orioles! They're very shy birds and this feeder was a waste of money. They all quickly went back to my hummingbird feeders.
Leaks badly after two days hanging.: I read the reviews and decided to try this feeder anyway. I just packaged it up to return. After two days, it was leaking badly on the seam on the top of the orange bottom part. Not where the bottle screws in. I could have lived with the impossible to empty and clean the bottom piece for the price, but it has to hold liquid... Good luck if you try it anyway like I did.
Big Expectations: We were having problems with bees taking over the hummingbird/oriole feeders & this sounded like a great solution. Unfortunately, the unit leaked around the bottom seam. The bees loved it...
Poor design!: This feeder works fine, however, it is the most difficult thing to clean I've ever had! First of all the container is a really awkward shape. It does not fit in your hand very well due to it's wide girth. An old soda bottle would be easier to handle! Secondly, it has a very small mouth which makes it difficult to insert a bottle brush. Then on the inside there are small plastic squiggles that hold the nectar dispensing buttons on which are also difficult to clean. The other problem is emptying the bottle. It's flattened at the bottom and even with vigorous shaking you can never completely empty it.If they were to change the shape of the bottle (make it smaller in girth and widen the mouth) It could be a great product!
Do not place where sun shines.: The oriole's didn't like this, but it didn't last more than a week until the sun beating on it warped where the bottom connected to the middle section & then it leaked. I should have returned it, but instead tossed it. Very disappointing. May have been OK in the shade, but the birds didn't care for it anyway. They liked the hummingbird feeder.
Bees In -- Birds Gone: I purchased this item based on its claim of the patented bee guards keeping bees out. First off it does not look like the picture, the drinking holes are round and have a small button inside that the orioles will push down to feed. Unfortunately, the bees learned within about an hour how to push the button down. They then go in to drink, can't get back out and die. The entire bottom of the feeder was full of bees within 24 hours of hanging the feeder. Does not work as intended. And is definitely not the same product shown.
good feeder: I've had this out for a couple of weeks now and it seems to be working fine. Seems to be well made and has not leaked. The orioles went to it within a couple of days. The picture looks like the feeding stations are made of rubber or something, but the one I received is hard plastic with the little plastic balls to keep bees out. The orioles just push the ball through to get the nectar. I added a couple of pictures of orioles feeding.
I disagree: The review before mine said that Progressive music is said to be cold and emotional in general. This is said by people who don't either like progressive music, or don't understand it. Progressive Music is the most emotional and warm music created if done correctly. This band is also great.
The Blessing Book.: It has been awhile since I read this book, I would have to go back and rereas it again to remember my reaction to it.
no suede in this item: It says in the description that this piece is suede leather. I was unhappy to find that the item included no suede leather in it whatsoever. It is inexpensive, durable cloth stitched together and has a nylon feel to it, and I will use this piece. However, moving forward I will be very wary about what I buy from gifted horse, since the description did not match the piece.
Very disappointing: Very disappointed in this title. We received a booklet which consisted of 8.5 x 11 in paper folded over and stapled to form an 80 page booklet.Most of the content is along the lines of what you might get from the local chamber of commerce. Some general information about the climate, a picture of the state flag, a "Food in Hawaii" section which lists McDonalds, Burger King, Subway... you get the picture.Information about real estate is rare and obvious. Like "Oceanfront property can be a good investment, but careful research should be undertaken to ensure it." I thought that's what I bought this booklet for, but that's about as detailed as it gets. You're better off just surfing the Net than to pay for this.Pass.
Don't waste your money: This isn't even a book; it's a stapled set of color copies. All of the information contained within can be found quickly on the Internet.
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!: ONE OF THE WORST DOCUMENTERIES I HAVE EVER SEEN AND I HAVE DOZENS. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
Fantastic book!: An absolutely wonderful read. ... 'The Black Arrow' is a fantastic book ... the 'Gone With the Wind' of our time. Good plot action, well rounded characters, the dialogue 'rings true' ... I am, frankly, blown away; I'd read it all over again tomorrow, but I want to get itinto others' hands. I am just SO tickled it's SO good!!!!
I'm sorry guys: This is not an excellent anything. Its a poor shadow of Atlas Shrugged, which ISN'T THAT GOOD OF A BOOK TO BEGIN WITH.This dude also completely ripped off Alan Moore's V for Vendetta which is about, drumroll please, a masked anarchist/libertarian taking on a corrupt goverment.Seriously this book is double-plagarized, he gets one star for his enormous balls and the fact that most of you don't seem to have noticed.
A Most Amazing Book: This book is now truly #1 in my collection of Libertarian and freedom oriented literature. I literally could not put it down.What a story! What a man! The Black Arrow signifies each of our own desires to rise up against the ever encroaching power and abuses of our government. The story line, some of it taken from actual documented cases, and most taken stricly from the mind of the author, is spellbinding. It is all quite believable that this very scenario could play out in the not too distant future.There's a little (or a lot of) something for everyone: drama, suspense, passion, love, sex, murder, weapons, heroism, oppression, and triumph. This book has it all, especially for freedom minded individuals worried about what the future might hold for us. Read it. You won't be disappointed!
Clear outlined approach that works!: First, this book will supplement any High School Geometry textbook. The problems in the book range from easy to challenging (some just tedious) that will help and prepare students for tests and other standarized exams. What I really like about this book is that, it lays down all of the concepts in a very clear way without using too many words. The book should be used more as a supplement, a reminder, and a guide to help you solve problems. It's not the most colorful and fun book to read, but it is worth all your money if you are looking for a good outlined approach to the subject.
Easy and Fun: "Geometry The Easy Way" really does live up to its name. I had tried "Geometry for Dummies" before but I was unable to realistically teach myself the basics with that book alone. (Maybe I needed Geometry for morons!" "Geometry the easy way" started out with simple concepts and slowly built upon those. The chapters were short and had numerous exercises that were very helpful. I actually discovered that geometry was fun-now that's a strange concept to grasp!I would recommend this book for anyone wanting to teach themselves the basics of geometry in a short amount of time.
It wasn't very detailed: I found many mathematical errors throughout this book. I didn't find it too interesting either. The editor should have read throughly this book before releasing it. The book covers some material but doesn't get into great depth.
This book was a blotch on Barron's record!: I read this book along with the other books of Barron's The Easy Way series. I thought the others were much better, and introduced the subjects they covered in a better way. I especially enjoyed Douglas Downing's fantasy novel setting. I thought this book was in a textbook fashion, not in a way that encourages readers to read and understand the content.
Not very good: I got this to help with geometry and to be honest it was not very helpful. I wanted something that could go more in depth then my textbook and this said just about the same exact thing as my textbook. If you are just trying to brush up on your math by yourself it may help you but if you are a student looking for some extra help this will not aid you at all.
A very dry read, definitely not easy: I don't recommend this book for beginners. First it's the kind of book where you have to read the chapters several times before you 'get it'. The exercises are complicated and confusing. For someone who hasn't picked up a geometry book in decades - look elsewhere.
Don't waste your time: I have always sailed through math courses.I ordered this book to review for my upcoming job teaching HS Geometryat a new school. I couldn't believe this book! Not only is this NOT theeasy way, but it leaves huge holes in guided practice. Where are thenotes about how to properly work out these proofs? There aren't any. Unless you are good at totally figuring this stuff out by yourself, don't buy this book. There are many typos also, which is a big red flag!
Geometry the easy way.: This book is great if you want to refresh your memory of high school geometry
The easy way: Great Book to help a student learn Geometry. GeometryThe Easy Way it the best way to learn. Get your copy.
Not laughing: John Ritter, Audrey Hepburn...and I used to like Ben Gazara. How could this be so NOT funny? Well, it is boring and silly and not worth watching. They are all so obvious.. TRYING.. wisecracking, elbowing each other. Too bad I paid for this...should have taken the other reviewers more seriously. I hoped it might at least be "pleasant" to watch with professional actors I enjoy. NOT! One star.
Beguilingly Charming Comedic Romance: This Peter Bogdanovich ensemble piece is as beguilingly sweet as the plot is simple: a gaggle of bumbling detectives play fodder for cupid when they fall head-over-heels in love with their respective marks.You almost can't help loving this movie even though its transparent ideological slant (infidelity isn't really wrong when it leads misunderstood spouses to true love) is rendered a bit creepy by the lens of Bogdanovich's real-life affair with Stratton (which arguably contributed to her murder). But despite Bogdanovich's self-serving cinematic rationalizations for seducing and manipulating a vulnerable beauty, the performances save the day; everyone from seasoned actors Audrey Hepburn and Ben Gazarra, to future star John Ritter, to emerging talents like Patti Hansen and Blaine Novak (and the luminous Stratton) are fabulous in their understated grace and charm.Includes an interesting interview with Wes Anderson
Not very good: The plot is hard to follow, and doesn't make a lot of sense. And Audrey Hepburn's character is not her average character. I couldn't finish watching it for boredom. Don't waste your time or money.
THEY ALL lAUGHED: I love Audrey Hepburn, but this movie is awful. It shouldn't be this bad with John Ritter and Audrey.
What a Disappointment: I purchased this movie because I am a big Audrey Hepburn fan. I was so disappointed with the movie. Audrey Hepburn was well past her prime when she made this. She had lost the spark she had in her younger days. There is not much of a plot. Ben Gazarra was terrible. He just wallked around with a smirk on his face and all the women he knew were supposedly smitten with him. He was so miscast in that role. He is a short man and not very masculine. It is hard to imagine women swooning over him. I regret having wasted my time watching this. It did have a good soundtrack and John Ritter was funny as a klutz, and Dorothy Stratton was beautiful, but not too believable. All in all I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
What is this movie about?: I am a bit of a New York City film fan too, and that is the ONLY reason I'm giving this movie a single star.I can't believe I just wasted 2 hours watching this movie.I have NO IDEA what it is even about. Private investigators chasing around people? FOR WHAT REASON? I enjoyed many of the scenes and the views of Brooklyn across the river, seem like another city, compared to what it looks like today. Unless you are into unique New York City movie scenes I would not recommend this movie AT ALL.
If movies were fabric this would be the cheapest polyester!: This film is definately in the running to be the worst ever made. I've watched it about 4 times, just trying to find some saving grace in it. But sorry, not even the grand Audrey Hepburn could save this one. I love wacky romantic comedies, however, this is neither romantic, funny, fun, or intelligent. It is simply lacking a script, and a good director. I feel it deserves minus 000000, but had to give it one star. It is sad that when Ms. Hepburn returned to films after an 8 to 9 year retirement she never again made a good film.
Disappointed: I bought this because Audrey Hepburn was in it and she is one of my all time favorites, but the movie, itself, does not live up to the hype on the cover. Very disjointed, very ridiculous, and found it very boring. There just didn't seem to be chemistry between the characters and the story, itself, was very weak. I would not recommend this movie even if you are diehard Hepburn fan like myself.
Kweskin's Garden Grows Another: One can never go wrong with anything Kweskin. Another direct hit by Jim and company as they mix divergent tunes such as Ted Snyder's 1920s era "Sheik of Araby", Fats Waller's "If You're A Viper", and Duke Ellington's "Mood Indigo". The jug band fun is still there with "My Old Man". We all went ballistic when we heard "When You're a Viper", with its drug inferred ending line.Oh, and by the way, this album was released in 1967, not 1976.
COMPLICITY Is An Important Book: I am so glad that I bought this one. I had read some of the Hartford Courant articles by Anne Farrow and wanted the full story of New England's part in slavery. This book is well researched and written. The authors are to be congratulated, and the Hartford Courant should be very proud of this team.
How the North Promoted, Prolonged, and Protected Slavery: Excellent well documented review of the real story of Lincoln's uunnessary WAR. The South , with support from the North,provided the cotton needed to make the USA 's solid export product Cotton was the crop of choice in 1860.
The legal goods: on why many companies should pay historical black organizations money as retribution for the dirty money they made in the slave trade. Companies like Aetna insurance, JP Morgan, Lehman Bros. etc are still benefitting from slavery's profits via interest and should be taken to court in a similar fashion to companies who were outted during the Holocaust. many legal scholars could read this book and develop many lawsuits for companies to be prosecuted for promoting and benefitting terror in America. The brutality of the ivory trade was very shocking and definitely needs more exploration. Any country that had the amount of free trade and labor along with never being prosecuted for the crimes has no excuse but to be the richest country in the world.
Unbalanced: No matter how much of this book is true, it certainly doesn't tell the whole story. The abolition movement in the North was very powerful, especially among certain Christian groups. Thousands of the men in the North who volunteered, and they were all volunteers at the beginnning of the Civil War had the moral purpose of ending slavery in mind. But with modern historical revisionism, all white men are bad, all persons of color are good! I've seen this time and again in current "histories" of the period. Certainly you can find racists anywhere you go in this world; the world of today and yesterday. Dwelling on the perceived evils of the past, committed by some, but not all, will not solve the evils of today. Therefore, what is this book worth to our modern society?
Complicity Indeed: Complicity is a great read! I could not put it down!It's a very revealing compilation of information about American slavery one never gets in school.I recommend the book as complimentary to the refined work by Edmund S. Morgan: American Slavery, American Freedom.Slavery? As with any exploitation, it's all about money!
Great stuff. German engineering.: Reduce the number and cost of supplies for running your spa with hydrogen peroxide. With this kit you can keep your spa sanitary using hydrogen peroxide. That is an advantage because there are no chemicals in it.
Flimsy.: I don't know why people are throwing out five stars for this gun. It practically fell apart in my hands when I first got it. Trust me, spend the extra cash on a Jing Gong.
Brilliant: The quality of the sound & variety of the duets makes this album an even more appealing listen. I'm a big fan of the BVSC this makes a good accompanyment to your collection.
Amazing amount of information: It is amazing how much information she managed to pack into this book, without overwhelming the reader AND with keeping it interesting. She included Old Norse (Icelandic?) language in the text without taking away from the content or causing confusion. (I don't speak either.) It actually added to the book. She covered all facets of Norse society and also noted the differences between how the Icelandic and Norse cultures developed over the years. It is definately a book that I recommend for anyone interested in historic Norse society, especially the female culture.
Norton 2004 Home Edition Virus Scan: Norton has been my virus program of choice....until now.I tried to install 2004 on Windows ME O/S, and it would not install correctly. Error message: that driver didn't download. My computer refused to run in normal mode, and would only run in safe mode. Can't connect to internet in safe mode, so unable to use Norton online support. Telephone support with Norton is appx $29.95 per call, so that wasn't an option. Program cannot be uninstalled in safe mode. Fortuneately, I know someone who is a computer tech who explained how to fix in MS DOS, which was enough to make my computer work in normal mode again, and allow me to uninstall.Tried re-installing and same thing happened. Contacted the store where I purchased the software, and apparently I'm not the first person to have this problem and Norton is aware of it.Personally, I think Norton should take it off the market since they know it could potentially harm some computers. Buyer beware.
A painful experience: So I ordered a supply of bountiful breast off of their website. To put it simply I did see minimal growth after 2 months. My breasts were fuller feeling but there were no mind blowing results. I didn't really follow the protein shake regimen regularly (only here and there). I would have continued taking it (because they recommend at least 3 months of it to see visible results) but I could not continue. My ovaries and uterus started killing me, so much so I went to the hospital. It must've been because of the excess of hormones in my body (I was also using a birth control pill at the time). It's too bad too because the pills are so expensive so I ended up blowing a ton of money. I don't think I'm going to buy any enhancement products of any kind anymore...
best weapons movie ever!: this is the best weapons movie ever! sammo is magnificent in this one...and he plays two roles! it's really incredible what skills the actors show off in this one! you have to see it to believe it!a must see for all action fans!
snap pants: we bought these for my elderly father. He liked them but they were a bit slippery so we had to stop using them.
Please send my exchange when possible.: The pants were really nice, but they were too large for my son. I requested an exchange (same style & color) in size medium. To date, I have NOT received the exchange. Could you please look into this for me.Thanks,Bonnie Cutler
card review: I enjoy glancing at these cards every so often. They help me to refocus when things are crazy.
Fabulous & highly recommended!: This always is a much-appreciated gift for anyone facing a turning point in life--and who isn't?! Very insightful and thoughtful on many levels.
Trite and treacly: I like to start the day with uplifting words and thoughts, so I keep a daily calendar with inspiring quotations or thoughts in the bathroom.While the title of this item, "I can do it" promises inspiration, the contents are trite."I look upon my past, present and future with love" offers no insight, no inspiration. "I am dancing on air because life loves me" is simply an empty thought.Perhaps here are people who find this inspiring. I don't.Jerry
Get it every year!: It's great to get a new uplifting message every day, and I get this calendar every year, and another one for my parents.
She has done it again! :): Louise is an incredible teacher. I love the cd that comes with this book, and the power and assertiveness in her voice and message. She suggests a 30 day listening regimen, and I'm doing it.Highly recommended! Thank you, Louise!
I Can Do It: How to Use Affirmations to Change Your Life: Louise Hay is an inspirational lady that I admire. I listen to her CD in my car everyday instead of listening to the radio or music. It is an incredible way of realizing how fortunate we are in life. Most importantly that we can create anything we want in life. Good or bad. It is a choice. Louise helps to make the right choices and to believe. Afterall, she never finished high school and came from an abused home. Look at her success. One day I hope I am fortunate enough to meet her.
Way too much time spent on the 0???: I have really appreciated all that Louise Hay's has done throughout the years, but the CD that comes with the book spends way too much time on the 0. I thought it was suppose to be inspiring affirmations. Instead, each track starts out for the first couple of minutes on how bad we are, I can't even listen to the CD. I can see mentioning on the first track that we need to be aware of how many 0 thoughts are ruling us then go onto how we can improve those 0 thoughts. You are supposed to focus on what you do want so I guess I will have to make my own CD. I still appreciate all Louise Hays has done, this review is just to express my confusion on what I thought I was purchasing, "positive affirmations"?
Wonderful CD to Change Your Life: This CD is excellent for changing one's 0 thought processes into more positive ones. I use it for myself, but also suggest it for my psychotherapy clients. I love Louise's voice and the pacing of this CD. It's great for all areas of your life, including health, prosperity, relationships, etc. I cannot recommend it enough!
INSPIRING AND HELPS ACHIEVE GOALS: All of Louise Hay's calendars from prior years have been inspiring and helpful to me in achieving my goals. I expect that this one will do the same. It is also a beautiful way to start the day ---- visually and verbally.
Once again, WONDERFUL!: Louise is just amazing. Since traveling along her road since the start of the new year, it is amazing how much better I feel when I try what she suggests. Simple things but putting all the power in your hands. If you want to be happy, it is up to you. When you are miserable, you can only blame yourself. I can't tell you how many people I tell about louise hay.
Love Louise Hay: I bought it used and the description said it came with a CD, but there was no CD. I would never buy used again
I Can Do It CD: Identical to printed book so it only needs to be listened to once.Not what I expected.
Wonderful CD: I simply love this cd!!!! I play it in the car while I'm traveling. It'seasy to listen to and hearing it really reinforces the wisdom of theaffirmations. If you're looking for some 1 reinforcement in yourlife, I suggest you purchase this cd. You'll be so glad you did!!!!!!
Cuppie Kowalski: My 19 year old daughter had this bunnie since she was 4. It is her most loved toy and when our car was robbed while taking her to college, she was devasted most over losing this baby. How joyed I was to find it here. NO, it isnt her same loved baby, but she loved how "fat" and fluffy his replacement was. This toy has help up through 15 years of play and love and we are confidant this new will as well.
Christmas present: my daughter asked Santa for a green bunny for Christmas. Thank God for the internet. totally happy and satisfied.
A book for every married couple to read: I bought this book after searching for a Let Go and Let God book. But before I bought this book, I found Nancy's summary on the internet which led me to the book. Being a saved young man whom did not know Christ, I continue to chase God. When God saved me, he saved my marriage and I've been kicking the enemy away from my wife for 5 years. Well, since then the Lord has been testing me, like he did Abraham. I rebuked the enemy and STOOD firm on God word and it seemed like the more I trusted God the worst things got. I mean really bad for me and my wife. Well, I did what Nancy talks about in this book. I had to get real with God and keep the faith alive. The reason I am writing this comment is so other men will read these words coming from a man and read this book. I am buying more books for family and friends. Thanks Nancy for a great little book!
Changed my marriage: I first read this at a critical time in my marriage, and it made such a difference. I have given out copies of this book to several other women through the years. It is a really good book. It made me appreciate my husband more and start looking to God for help with my marriage instead of waiting for my husband to make changes.
Motivating Hispanic Employees: During several of your personal anecdotes in the book I couldactually visualize the events. I have never seen a book that lays out such a clear game plan for managers, co-workers, or anyone who wants to relate better and work more effectively with people who are Hispanic.
Essential Reading For Employers: Carlos Conejo provides practical and valuable information for managing Hispanic employees. While not every Hispanic worker falls into the same pattern the author points out cultural tendencies that are crucial to understanding how to help these employees reach their potential in the workplace and how companies can reap the benefits.This guide will assist you in hiring, retaining and motivating people from the fastest-growing ethnic group in America. If you have any Hispanic employees you need this book. If you don't have any Hispanic employees you REALLY need this book!
Dunne's rich invitation to a choice for spiritual adventure: A reader starts a journey with Dunne's hypothetical searcher to experience solitude andconnection: and to discover in both intimacy with God and man. Rather than avoid the struggle inherent in the separation of man from God and man from man, Dunne encourages the spiritual voyager to travel to and fro finding God in both and soul in the gap between mind and body. The author uses Christianity to transcend theology and human psychology and to open a door to experience God in oneself and in mankind.
not happy :(: The first time I washed this sheet it looked like a thousand fuzz balls on it. I was afraid to use it, in fear my child would try to pick them off and put them in his mouth.
Entertaining..: This book was originally published in French, and as such, a bit of the context has persisted. However, there's a lot to be learnt from in this book about surviving in a large organization. The word play is excellent. Very enjoyable -- a fun read!
Short, Mildly Entertaining & Anti-American: I purchased this book in a airport bookstore primarily due to a lack of good books to choose from. This particular book looked like a humorous quick read, which it was. Actually, it read too fast (took me under 1 hour) and took constant jabs at American business and culture. Written by a French author, I wasn't surprised by the blatant anti-Americanism, and I would guess her cynicism towards business culture will be received the wrong way by many readers in France, where this book has already sold 300,000+ copies. In fairness to the author, she did also poke fun at French laziness and their long time high unemployment rate. I think most Americans who read this book would get a good laugh from this humor, but I seriously wonder how many French will take this advice seriously? If you can get your hands on a free copy, it's worth at least reading a chapter or two, but I wouldn't spend any money on it.
vtech vsmile smartridge batman gotham city rescue: vtech vsmile smartridge batman gotham city rescueI DID NOT RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT I HAVE TRIED TO INFORM AMAZON AND THE SELLER BUT HAVE GOTTEN NO WHERE THIS IS 2 OF 5 ITEMS PURCHASED I DID NOT RECEIVE I WILL BE VERY LEARY OF DOING BUSINESS ON AMAZON AGAIN, I ALSO DID NOT GET ANY REFUND JUST WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS ONE.
Disorganized and uninsightful: The book does not give an adequate survey of Renaissance Art - in fact, it is not about Renaissance Art at all - most of the book is devoted to pre- and early Renaissance art. Only the last chapter covers the High Renaissance and it is the shortest one in the book. Instead it rambles on and on through some key artists and leaves things at that. They do not describe at all what distinguishes a certain city or period fom another - instead they hone in on one or two paintings, yak about it for a while and leave the reader to infer what they mean. The very worst part is that most of the paintings they babble on and on about are not even plated in the book. Extremely diffuse and a grand waste of time and money.
Order it from Vault.com: This is a great book, but if you need it right away and don't want to pay a special handling fee order it directly from Vault.com. The eBook version is also available there as well as the new 2003 edition that is not available yet in bookstores.
Kitchen Orginization: Love these Chrome Tray Dividers! Ordered two--they came very quickly! I already had several in white for another cabinet, but really needed this size for a smaller, tall cabinet. Was thrilled to find them in chrome. They organize my baking sheets, pizza stone, and serving trays. A must to organize kitchen cabinets!!
Better than expected: Well, I didn't have really high hopes for this large divider, but it is holding back MANY brown paper bags with absolutely no evidence of leaning!
Excellent organizer: This device does what it is supposed to do and is very helpful in storing materials when space is at a premium
A milestone in the study of phenotypic plasticity: For any evolutionary biologist interested in how evolutionary events are molded and modulated by phenotypic plasticity and developmental processes this book is a "must have". It is a huge, widesweeping review and synthesis of the problem of development and evolution. It will remain as the benchmark for the field for many years. No one can approach this subject without having read this book. In perspective it ranges from the molecular to the macroevolutionary, but always manages to maintain a highly readable style.
OK but who's going to read this ?: I have a PhD in biochemistry (meaning I can understand a reasonable amount of jargon) and hoped that with this book I'd be able to understand what modern developmental biology (in particular developmental genetics, "evo-devo", etc.) is about, but this book bored me to death. There is no continuum, no logical progression in the teaching. When you reach the end of a chapter you've forgotten what it was about. I admire the central concept and the work but, frankly, as a book it's completely missed. It is not a textbook, it is not a popularization book, it's a 600+pages small print dissertation. Who wants to read that ? Who has the time to go to the library and check the details of any of the hundreds of referenced articles (all of them are treated only superficially) ? Not students, not professional scientists (their time would be better spent reading review articles), not laypersons. Who then ?
PACKAGING IS A HASSLE: Not enough information is given in the product description: it is cumbersome to break off, bend repeatedly, peel off the backing from one (microscopic) corner flap, then push through the foil---all to liberate one chewing piece of gum! Nicorette is available in a much more user-friendly format, akin to other, regular, popular packaged gum brands. I should which type of packagedNicorette I am getting when I order! The gum itself is good. This comment applies to the 2 mg and 4 mg types.
Matsu Takako - Sweet voice, great music: I first discovered Matsu Takako when I was watching a Japanese tv show called "Love Generation" also starring very handsome and talented Kimura Takuya. I listened to this Second Wave 2003 concert CD and it is great. Matsu Takako has a very sweet voice. She is very talented also, not only is she a great singer, but she also composed some of the songs that are on this CD. Majority of the songs are slow ballads and the music is very relaxing. She only has like one or two medium temp ones which were fun to listen to. If you have not heard any of her music and want to give her a try, this is a nice CD. But note: this is a live recording of her concert. Some people may not like that live recordings, if you don't like live recordings and want to listen to Matsu Takako, but never heard any of her songs, I recommend her: Five Years Singles, which contains greatest hit singles from the beginning of her 5 years music career.
Bad: I really wasn't expecting it to be good as the original version by Kurosawa and Mifune, but this is exceedingly bad. I guess I was expecting a new interpretation of the characters and updated action sequences. No such luck. This is almost a verbatim script of the original and worst of all it's as if the actors were trying to imitate the orginal cast down to facial expressions. I wasn't expecting the masterful camera work of Kurosawa, but this one's down-right amaturish. The actor playing Sanjuro just doesn't have the maturity, toughness, roughness, uncouthness of Mifune. When they cast a younger actor, they should have let him reinvent the character. Bottom line - watching this movie was like watching a mediocre high school production based on a classic movie.
DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK / DON'T EVEN READ IT!!!!: I just finished my CISM exam and I hope that I can save someone else the same agony I went through. The material in this book is 100% USELESS!!!! (I'm screaming from a mountain top with no exaggeration). If you find this book lying on the sidewalk, DON'T even pick it up. I spent about 20 hours studying the material in this book and taking the pre-tests and not one bit of that effort prepared me for the exam, and I'm being nice!!! USE THE MATERIAL FROM ISACA, not this garbage! It's as if the authors have never even heard of CISM, maybe there is another CISM exam that I am not aware of?!?!?!Signed,Unfortunate purchaser
The CISM Prep Guide: Please do not, under any circumstances spend money on this book. There is actually no real good study material in general for the CISM exam. This book has not been revised since 2003.This is a horrible book for this exam. DO NOT BUY IT. Plain enough?
CISM Prep Guide - A Complete Failure: This book was literally a cut and paste of the author's previous work. I just took the CISM exam, and if I had assumed this book could help me pass the test, I would have failed. This is NOT the CISSP, and the fact that they could not take the time to remove references to "studying for the CISSP", in this book tells me it was glued together, and that is being VERY kind.DO NOT WASTE A DIME ON THIS BOOK!!!
Outdated Indeed: I'll just echo what others have said before me: in 2008 this book is so outdated that it's no longer useful for the CISM exam. Spend your money on the ISACA guides instead.
CISM Exam far different: It must be difficult to write an exam review book before the exam is actually offered. I purchased this book for additional reference before taking the CISM Exam over the past weekend; 6/03. This was the first time the exam has been offered to the public. I estimate that 80% of the exam questions where not covered in this book. While the material presented by the author's is valid, it did not help much in terms of the exam. This book is much more useful for someone trying to obtain the CISSP not CISM.
CISM book--very POOR, really mostly a CISSP book: CISM PREP book--very poor, really mostly a CISSP book shortened and re-covered. ............ ........... ................ ......... .......... This is ok as a secondary CISM resource as there is not much out there for CISM, but the ISACA books are worth getting moreso. This book gives the impression the CISM exam is very technical like the CISSP exam but it is not. Again this book and the sample exam questions cover DoD security and encryption that the CISM exam does not. It is good to know but that is for the CISSP exam.
A cat story for whatever mood you might be in.: Want a funny cat story? A scary cat story? Perhaps a touching one? The New Roger Caras Treasury of Great Cat Stories has more than a few to choose from. There's plenty of fanciful feline fiction to curl up with between the covers. So pour yourself a cup of your favorite beverage, curl up in your favorite chair, and purr with delight as you sample a story, or two. Recommended.
Deceiving!, not OEM as claimed.: I ordered Aprilaire 201 filter (two in 1 box) from Amazon. When arrived, the box does not look like what was shown on Amazon website at all. Once I opened it, the filter has no printed label on its rim at all. The OEM one did have the Aprilaire logo and model #. I know that because I ordered and received from Amazon last year the OEM product, and the very filter was in the filter box when I was doing the replacing today. This is deceiving. I read the review very carefully and was convinced I will get the authentic OEM product. I know Amazon can not police every vendor that carefully. I hope through this review, Amazon would kick these dishonest bad apples out.
Furnace Filter: This filter was no different in quality from the filters bought locally in the past. I would recommend and will continue to purchase this product.
Does the job: Not much to say other than, I got exactly what I ordered. A replacement filter for my HVAC system. I change this out once a year and it does a good job filtering dust
Savings for replacement filters: Man, what a life saver in finding this product for the price. I normally would go to my local heating and cooling company and get one (1) air filter for about $75.00. I never though about ordering furnace parts online. By ordering through Amazon, I was able to get three (3) filter for the same price. Man I am so happy. Not only do I have the correct replacement filter but I have spares for a great price. Thanks again.
Right picture- wrong product: This picture should be change on Amazon's front page. I ordered this product based on picture, but got different filter. Had to call company for exchange the right one.Also, original name "Aprilaire Space-Gard" now replaced by "Lennox Healthy Climate". People said it the same quality and size, but I preferred get what I paid for.
Works very well!: My baby was extremely fussy because she was gassy and in pain. I used Mylicon and it worked so well. The only thing is that you really have to follow the directions for it to work effectively. The anitgas medicine in Mylicon is simethicone, and it works best if you give your baby the dose before the feeding rather than after the feeding. I also used Colic Calm, which is an all natural gripe water type of medicine and it just didn't work as well for my baby. First, Colic Calm is black and it stains anything and everything it gets on, including your skin. It washes off skin but does not wash off clothing. So your precious baby's clothing may get stained with black marks on it from Colic Calm. And it's just not as effective as Mylicon. Mylicon does a great job at getting rid of gas. I highly recommend this product!
At times a blessing...: At times, this product is a godsend. If your child is fussy and you don't know why, just try it.
Really helps with gas: I give this to daughter each time I feed her. Her gas has improved a lot. A lot less crying now.
don't think it works: I don't think this product works. I just think it quiets baby for a while because it's sweet.
This is one of their best ever.: "Come On Now Social" was OK, but it made me think that their best years were behind them. "Become You" totally blew me away - every last song on here is catchy, memorable, and will stick in your head at one time or another. And the last track.. wow... so very sweet... Viva la indigo! Can wait to see you at the Pier in Seattle!
The Girls are Becoming: This is a great CD! Amy and Emily are amazing in there latest work. They combine both there styles in a spunky heartfelt series of songs. It is more acoustic sound, with lots of southern feel like the title song "become you." The bonus CD is an extra surprise that includes the song Laramie by Amy. If you like the girls and good music buy IT!!
Another fantastic album from the Girls!: I LOVE this album! I can't stop listening to it. Amy & Emily have made another winner. Their lyrics continue to be inspiring and uplifting. Their harmonies and instrumentation are as wonderful as ever.Buy it while you can still get the bonus disk.
A Good Listen: I have enjoyed the Indigo Girls for years but this is the first of their albums that I have bought. There are some really great songs on this CD with heartfelt lyrics. I especially like Hope Alone and Moment of Forgiveness. This is a great CD to put on when you want to set a mellow mood.
Departure from Recent IG sound: This album is truly excellent though remarkably distinct from the more fast-paced rock songs of <Come On Now, Social.> My favorite track is the beautifully written "Starkville," where Amy Ray continues to show her incredible genius. I love the Indigo Girls and to a certain extent I prefer the more catchy songs of previous IG albums, but a return to the old standards of their earlier career is far from a bad thing. There are no better musicians anywhere today, so I highly recommend that you get this album.
One good song & a lot of filler...: I'm bummed about this one. I heard a concert they did & was drawn into buying this. there are a lot better Indigo Girls albums out there, they don't sound as together as they used to. The writing isn't working... Of course I really liked Swamp Ophelia, so what do I know...
Too close to "easy listening": This CD is somewhat of a disappointment after themore eclectic Come On Now Social. Gone is Amy'sedgier guitar work, and gone is Emily's foray intocountry-pop. What's left is mostly easy listeningpunctuated by a few tracks from Amy Ray that keep theCD somewhat listenable without putting you to sleep.I wouldn't say this CD is a return to form -- it doesn'thave the spirit of the earlier releases. Does anyoneremember "Kid Fears"? Now there was spirit. This CD,a few tracks aside (Moment of Forgiveness, Become You,Bitterroot), is just mushy.
indi twins: When I was really young, I used to bet the other children that I could swallow loose change. The most I ever did was 78 cents and one of them was a quarter.
Become You ~ Indigo Girls: I'm so thrilled with this CD. It is the traditional IG I first fell in love with. I like the rockier stuff too, however, this is the way I like to hear them best.They have added some additional instrumentation that I haven't heard before from them, and I love it, love it, love it!!!
Indigo Girls Do Not Disappoint: This is an older CD but one I didn't have. If you like the Indigos, you'll enjoy this nice balance of mellow harmonies and folk rock.
Girls become average: Being a longtime devotee to Indigo Girls, I was quite excited when I read the reviews that said this album is a throwback to their early days. I bought it expecting folk-rock at its finest. I must say, I'm disappointed.Not only does this album not live up to classic IG such as "Nomads*Indians*Saints" and "Rites of Passage," it doesn't live up to a lot of other similar artists' offerings (Dar Williams, Ani Difranco). Sure, there are a few songs that have the glimmer of the old IG magic, such as "Become You" and "Starkville". Most of the rest though blend together in overly-sappy pop ballads - with the exception of "Bitter Root," which just seems woefully out of place.Maybe I'm an IG purist. Maybe I'm a snob. Maybe I'm like the REM fans that think anything after "Green" or "Out of Time" just doesn't live up. I don't know. Regardless, "Become You" just didn't do it for me.
Buy this CD for the bonus disk!: Buy this CD for the bonus disk! For me, the Indigo Girls have always been about the lyrics. Yes, the harmonies are wonderful, but it is how these harmonies work with the winding, twisting, turning journey of the lyrics that make their music stand out. I'm not sure that the IGs will ever again have the consistent journey-type lyrics like they did in the early years.The album "Become You" does have some of the old fire, but the best four lyrics are found on the bonus disk in amy's solo "Laramie" ("tolerance it ain't acceptance"). The bonus version of "Strakville" is soulful, and the bonus version of "She's Saving Me" is nice as well. Get "Become You," enjoy it, enjoy the bonus disk, but definitely hang on to your collection of 1980's and early 90's IGs.
Really good tunes: I've been a fan for over 10 years-back from their days in Athens, GA at the Uptown Lounge. My favorite stuff is the old stuff-the raw sound of Strange Fire. While Become You rings of that old soulful sound, it's polished and mature. They've come a long way baby!
been waiting for this one for a long time: I remember where it all began, so many years ago. All of their albums in between were also a part of the infinite circle, that of 'becoming you'...reaching us when we were ready, because digging deep into our self (as conscious beings) is not always easy. And then, through music, the indigo girls lead us back to this place....almost like a gospel, serene folk music weaved with the wisdom of social consciousness. This album is filled with incredible guitar & piano, exquisite & timeless lyrics & perfect harmony (which I am always amazed by). Songs to listen to on the rocking chair of the front porch, as the sun sets...songs to sing to your children....however hard it may have been to become you, it is only through this process that we find our wisdom.
Become You: Well... i can't really say anything about the extra cd since i was too impatient to buy the cd online(who knows when it would have arrived!).... but i can assure you that Become You is truly worth buying! Like everyone said... This cd is strictly acoustics-- no electric ::snif:: The songs on this cd are most like Leaving and Devotion (Not that suprising if you think about it). Anyway... i'll shut up now so you can purchase your new cd!
Great idea, but not too flavorful and unfriendly to teeth: I wanted to like these crackers, given the awesome nutritional profile and ingredients. I would say two and a half stars, and it's because the idea is great but the execution is not so good. I'm just unhappy that I'm stuck with five more bags of these things.There are two primary weaknesses:1) Lack of flavor. I think I need to try the other cracker flavors, because these are just whole flaxseeds with some Bragg Liquid Aminos (soy sauce, basically) and lemon juice, and the flavor is just not enough for me.2) Awful chewing experience. When you eat one of these, the flaxseeds stick. Everywhere. Between your teeth. On the roof of your mouth. Lodged around your jaw. Really, it takes a long time to feel like you don't have flax embedded everywhere in your mouth. Not a very social snack, for this reason.I hope they keep working on this, as the idea is good.
Don't taste good: These crackers serve the purpose of getting flax down, with what that does, but they do not taste good, to me. I'm going to try some other brands and not get these any more.
Could have been tastier and less slimy.: Just got these crackers because of the positive reviews. I guess the saying "to each his own" is a truism because these crackers are pretty bad. One could not eat them unless one was super starved. Not oly don't they taste good but they are of slimy consistency. Would never buy them again but I have to give the company some kuddos for their effort to come up with gluten free products.
Golden Flax Crackers: These were stale and tasteless. I do not intend to spend my money on any more. I cannot eat wheat, dairy, food additives, or sugar so the items that I can eat are very limited. These were certainly not worth the money and were a huge disappointment.
Empty: The first chapter or two could have made an interesting magazine article. The book as a whole is otherwise empty of any useful content.The author wishes to impress us that he has heard of every computer term, and continually trots these out in no particular order and mostly not in context.His message boils down to:- AI has some uses today, and the AI/Expert System vendors are worth looking to for a programming tool to address today's programming needs. There you are, there is no need for you to read the book now!
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE!!: This is the typical bad Mexican movie that is not worth $1 dolar in my opinion!! THe only good use for this dvd is to throw it around like a freesbe!!!
Not Bad!: PROS:Easy installation on my car (Toyota Corolla 2008)Increases visibility at night and also in extreme conditionsBulbs (H3) can be changed to more powerful bulbsGive a new look to the carCONS:Can be dificult to install electrical wiring ...Bulbs which are provided are not very bright, only 55W ....
The boy is from New Jersey: This film is a story based on the bronze statues of three soldiers depicted in the Viet Nam Memorial, in Washington D.C. Three marines are trapped behind enemy lines in a war-torn VietNam and must journey through occupied territory in a school bus to reach an American safety unit miles away. It's a ride through Hell in a country without Law and justice. The acting is very good and the film has quality for it's small budget, and good FX. Daniel Stephen who always performs his own stunts was great. More realistic then Chuck Norris and Rambo. ...
Very Cute and Colorful: The Pooh wall art looks really cute up on my little girls wall. She seems to like it as well, and stares at it all the time. I like that Eeyore plays music, that is a nice touch. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that the sticker to press to make the music play is off centered, I have to press next to the sticker instead of right on it. It's no big deal but I think they could have gotten it right. Other than that this is a great decoration!
practical: it's one of the decorative in my baby's room that I like. it's easy to put in the wall yet it adds the variety of the room
Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms: I did not recive the book. It is more than one month, they made mistake with the delevery and I pay the delay of it
Fly on the wall: I did not enjoy this book as much as the rest of his books. It took me a long time to fully understand the characters in the book. The other day, I heard this book being compared to a glass of water. This person said, "It is like water. It really has no flavor, but at least it goes down quickly." I agree with this because overall, I did not like this book.
Boring Book: This was just a very boring story. On top of that the author was the reader on the tape and he is just monotone. No change of inflextion, pitch or anything to make it more pleasurable to listen to. I thought it was too full of details about numbers and lacked a lot for a mystery.
Not one of his best: I enjoy the Hillerman Navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed. Not so in this book. I found the first half really boring and hard to get through. The characters were not people you could care about, an important issue for me.
have you ever wished to be a fly on the wall?: In this novel by Mr. Hillerman, the well developed story puts the reader in a position as strong observer. He uses great comparisons to the fly on the wall idea to bring you into the action.
Love T. Hillerman: I really enjoy how Mr. Hillerman threads Native beliefs and traditions into his plots. Even though this isn't my Tribal affiliation, love the information.
Fantastic compilation!: Words cannot describe how well this album was put together. This is within my top five favorite compilations ever made. The tracks flow into one another smoothy and effortlessly. Jazzanova's arrangements of these songs apply different moods to the album that transend from melodic to jazzy to lounge-like "chill time" moods. This album is perfect for a dinner party, get together or a summer drive in the country. Plus the mastering on the album is so crisp and clean, that it is hard to believe that these songs were recorded over 20 years ago.Jazzanova hits the mark on making this album as one of the greatest compilations ever made!
A Treat for Blue Note Lovers: As a fan of both Blue Note and Jazzanova, this double CD was the coming together of two musical greats. Jazzanova, known for their forward moves in the dance music genre, was given complete access to the entire Blue Note catalog and came up with over two hours of perfectly chill jazz. CD number one (called Lookin' Back)exposes the listener to the likes of Bobbi Humphrey, Donald Byrd, Bobby Hutcherson, Herbie Hancock, and Freddie Hubbard. Hubbard's cut, Blue Spirits is simply hypnotic and should be experienced by all music lovers.CD #2 is titled Movin' On and features some of the same artists with the addition of Tina Brooks, Sheila Jordan and Eddie Gale. I'll admit to enjoying CD#1 more, but both are wonderful in their own right. It is an excellent compilation for one who loves jazz and for someone who wants more exposure to the art form.
Wonderful time, wonderful album: Let me concur with my Swedish colleague and add one thing: The arrangement on "Living in the Sunlight" is by one of the true originators and masters of big band arranging, Benny Carter. If you look at the personnel for that one cut, you can see why the album cost Geoff Muldaur a fortune. Truth to tell, Geoff's was the first version of the song I heard, thirty-odd years ago, but I've since heard one by Maurice Chevalier, in which--if I remember correctly--he claims that he "goes sweemin' with naked weemin!"
...A TIMELESS piece of music: What? you haven't ordered this album yet? What are you waiting for? Geoff Muldaur put this classic compilation together way back when and I have nearly worn out my cd player listening to it. If you look at the cover you get some idea of Muldaur's sense of humor. I want to say listen to this cut or that cut but truth be told, ..the whole album is a work of love... AND .. they spent a ton of money in producing it. Muldaur may never see the return of profit but, ..may I suggest you buy it and play it while you are at home cooking, reading the Sunday paper, driving in your car and in need of a humorous lift to your day. Note: This album is probably not going in your collection if you have every album made by Megadeath.
A bit of a disappointment: I'm thinking about adding a pond feature to my property and purchased this DVD to give me ideas. Basically it's little more than a "Laguna" pond products DVD. Yes, it covers the very simplest of basics but really doesn't provide enough information to build a good pond much less a "perfect" pond. It did include a calculation for determining a pond liner size but it didn't explain how to calculate/determine pump size, filter size or type. They essentially discussed their products with a few very basic pond ideas and that was about it. Nothing they discussed creates the "Perfect Pond". A couple pond magazines would provide far more information.Don't waste your money.
One of my Favorites: This was one of my favorite childhood books and I was delighted to find it on Amazon. The illustrations are as stunning, vivid and eye catching as I remembered. I only gave it 4 stars because the actual book I received turned out to be an old library book (still with the label and everything) and I wasn't expecting that. The book, however, was in good condition. I bought this for my 19 month old son. I think its a little too mature for him just yet, but I think he'll love it when he gets a little older.
Great until it ripped: Initially I liked the softness of this sheet. It fit my standard sized mattress well and didn't seem to shrink at all. After about 10 washings, however, the sheet was visibly thinner. When I was removing it from the mattress for washing, it ripped up the side. I did give it a gentle tug, but no stronger than usual and none of my other sheets have ripped. Disappointing since otherwise I had been pleased with this product.
not the article: Ten bucks and nowhere does it say that this is just the abstract, not the full article. A complete rip-off as the title pretty much gives away the substance of the abstract. No meat here.
Not for Nebraskans for sure.: If you live in Nebraska, where the highlight of a fun filled evening might be going down to the local bakery and watching the Cheeze-Wiz dry on the pastry, then I suppose you would confuse WESTERN CULTURE with music that has no soul. It's soul may be an alien soul, but it's a darn sight better than standing out in the corn field listening to the wind blow through your ears.
Contoversial....: .....as evidenced by the little "war" going on between Mr. Plantation, Florida and Mr. Rubidium84. At least Rubidium84 had an opinion about the music, wheras Plantation, Florida merely insults Rubidium84's home state. I would like to know what Plantation, Florida thinks of the MUSIC, not Nebraska.Here's what I think of the music: Too much unrelated elements going on at the same time. Too many woodwinds. The drummer doesen't use enough toms, and he plays in 11/16 when everyone else is in 21/32.However, you've got to give them one for being brave enough to release this in 1978, the year after punk took over.
Yuck: This album is stupid. The people who made this album are stupid. Everyone who likes this album is stupid. I wish I could give it no stars, because it is SO stupid.
The Finest Henry Cow: For me, this is the most focused and cohesive Henry Cow album yet. Not much filler here, this one is far more composed than their previous works.The final chapter to the band (unless there's more in the vault, Chris Cutler), the Cow, in their own style piece well-formed themes and rhythmic variations into a seamless work of art. Im gushing here, because this is the album I would have liked to create, to summarize the jarring inequities of Western Culture.If you like earlier HCow, without the long improvs and dangling cacaphony, this is the piece for you. This one seems totally composed. And for once, the final mix is elegant. You can actually hear a balance in tones and colors.For those just starting to listen to this band...this is the place.
hermeneutically challenged: This Bible Study was disappointing in its selection of verses for the topic. Some obvious passages that should have been used were not and some obscure passages were selected and my Bible Study felt the verses were not interpreted correctly, especially the selection on Daniel. I would not recommend this one, but other Life Guide studies I've enjoyed like the one on David.
Not Impressed: I have spent some time on the water with my finder and was looking for some answers to things I have not been able to figure out. They are not in this video. Some of the simple things I thought should have been discussed were not. I have also noticed some errors which I plan to contact the publisher about. Over all, I was not impressed.
An excellent, very funny, first novel.: FLRD is an excellent, very funny, first novel. The setting is urban, the characters young and at that stage where they're either successful or bored and onto their next job. The male characters aren't as interesting as the female characters, but they're well done.FLRD is quite similar in style and approach to Russell Smith's novels (eg Noise), but she does a better job with her characters. Russell Smith's female characters are shallow plot decorations, but Roxane Ward's female and male characters are better balanced.Indigo, the main character, is the sort of person one wishes one had as a friend.It's nice to see a woman outdoing the men in writing a funny, urban novel for a change.
Valuable introduction to the labyrinth mysteries and powers.: This book is probably the best way to start with the study of the multiple significations and applications of this ancient labyrinth science. Full of very good references, and stangely enlightened insights. Two flaws however: often stays at the surface of an idea, sometimes gets a little carried away. That's why it's more of an introduction than a true reference book. My advice: read this book and then go to Grace Cathedral in San Fransisco walk the labyrinth.
Looks great: I had bought this weathertech deflector that said it was the right one for my car. When I got it it didn't fit the contours of the roof. I emailed the manufacturer but no response. I sent it back to Amazon, of course they gave me my full refund back. I've heard other's say that they had no problems with theirs but for me I went with another brand that fits great!
precursor of de Sade: I decided to read this after noting Henry Miller's enthusiasm for the book in The Tropic of Cancer (I figured if Miller liked it, it must be good). I was sorely disappointed. I have nothing against bawdy or scatological humor on principle, but I found Rabelais simply boring, tasteless, and completely bereft of genuine humor. This is the sort of thing that gets guffaws from 12-year old boys who think that simply using foul language makes them endlessly witty. If you want early novelists with a tendency toward the bawdy and/or scatological, I recommend Boccaccio, Cervantes and Sterne. And if you absolutely, positively must wallow in a cesspool of disgusting smut, go to the master - the Marquis de Sade.
great stuff: Damned good and brilliantly innovative. No doubt of its influence on experimental writers from the 16th century onwards.
DISAPPOINTED!!!: Bought this product couple days ago. When i first brought it out of the box it seemed cheaply made and flimsy. When I tried to turn the product on it did not even turn on. I don't know if the product is defective, but I would not recommend anybody to purchase this product. The quality is poor and it is definitely not worth what you pay for. Hopefully I will be able to return it and get my money back.
what a dissapointment: We purchased this because of allergies,smoke,pets, etc and it did not make a bit of difference. unless u have a CLEAN, dust free no problem home this will do nothing for you. don't waist your money. AMAZON on the other hand are so fast, awesome customer service.
Can get knocked over and break easily: This air purifier works like a miracle, but you have to stand it up away from walls and furniture. My dog knocked it over, and one time was all it took to break it. For this reason, I would not recommend it to anyone who has pets or children or who is clumsy. (I paid about $125.00, not the $700.00 being asked for here.)
Love the Quiet: WE have these throughout our house because of cat fur, salt air, and sand dust flying. They work very well, and I love the quiet!This newer model is much easier to clean.
works great: It works really well. If you run it all the time so that the air remains pure, it doesn't make any noise...but if you only run it at night, then it does. Also, it does require cleaning (and I'm not talking just pulling the little thing on the side. I'm talking pulling out the filter and washing it down until you can see your reflection in it again). We have dogs and it seems we end up cleaning it a lot more often than the user guide said. We're very happy with it overall!
I wouldn't buy any watch but a Casio!: If you want to know what time it is then all you need is a $16 Casio. The battery lasts interminably if one refrains from using the lamp. Ultra reliable in the rain or shower under normal circumstances.
Close enough for government work: The only flaw in this design is in the buttonholes used to mount the liner inside of the field jacket. Some of these were stitched improperly, and you can already see some of the cotton leaking out even during the first installation. This makes some parts of the liner difficult to install, but if you're only taking it off and putting it on once each per year, that can't be much of a problem, now can it?Oh, and yes, it is warm.
Great Read: Love Love Love this book , i even shared with my best-friend , Great for singles to read , step and insight of being content in your place as a single
No good: Not impressed with the book at all. I am a recent widow and needed help. Not there, in my opinion.
the best energy bar out there: Our whole family loves these - it's my breakfast every day and it keeps me full until the early afternoon. For Weight Watcher's it's only 5 points. Our son takes one to school every day for a snack - we love, love, love these!
Great Product: -We have been buying this product (the cherry flavor as well) for the last-year to supplement our diet. We like it becos it is a healthy snack and-helps as a quick alternative to junk food for our 3 yr old. Its also-cheaper on Amazon than buying it in a Natural Food Store.
A must read for health enthusiasts: I consider Life Extension the "bible" of health books. A lot of practical and scientific work has gone into this must have book. With this book and "How to tell what health foods to buy", you pretty much cover what you need to stay healthy and live longer!
Do New Research: Do research before following any of the recommendations in this book, which is seriously outdated. Some of the mega dosage advice is actively harmful -- for example, diabetics and many post-menopausal women should not take over 200 to 250 mg of vitamin C.It is a great historical reference for the "cutting edge" thinking of its time, however.
Twenty-plus years reveal their charlatanry: This book has become more of a historical curiosity than a relevant guide to improving one's health. Although Durk and Sandy tried to do a morally defensible thing, their efforts to intervene into their aging processes via concentrated man-made chemicals don't seem to have succeeded. If you search for recent photos of them on the Web, you'll notice that these days they look like hell.
Outdated: Please do not buy this book. There is way more current information on life extension over the Internet. This book is about thirty years old and is written by a quack doctor. It is a waste of money. Trust me I know. You wont extend your life reading this book. Just waste an hour or two reading through this garbage. My honest opinion.
v good, which i expected. reference text.: even with shipping fees, the price was so low it was practically unbelievable!! this was a replacement for a stolen copy. there are hundreds of theories on life extension - none of course, proved. i keep durk and sandy's book on hand as an invaluable reference text which gives a complete listing and break down of all foods, nutrients, additives, building blocks, amino acids , etc. using scientific annotation, etc.
If you are curious about how to live longer, get this book.: I haven't finished this book yet but what I have read is useful all ready; what vitamins or supplements to use and why.The chapters read quick.
Poor transfer: ONE STAR is for the poor transfer. Take my word for it - buying this so called "remastered" classic film is a waste of money. I opted for this more expensive edition thinking I'd get a decent print. Instead, it was of such poor quality - constantly breaking up, and at time completely stopping, I gave up watching. An old copy I have from TV is far superior.Amazon should be ashamed they listed this item for sale.Go for the cheaper version - I doubt it could be worse.
Good transfer of a very old movie: First off, its amazing how many people complain about bad quality of old old movies.I wanted to get a good copy of this (to replace my VHS) and opted for a this version. I was a little wary looking at a review, but I was very pleased. I put it in my DVD/Bluray and it up-played it even more. Compared to older copies, this is probably the best that we can make a movie shot on film almost 60 years ago.Video 8/10Sound 8/10Highly recommend!
Beat the Devil: The quality of this dvd is marginal. The voices and lips don't match up for the first part of the movie which is very annoying but then they come together. There are several times when the dvd stopped but would resume on it's own. I know it's an old movie but if I paid more than $5.00 for it (which I did), it was too much.
Incredibly Disappionting: I don't know what they consinder remastering but the image quality is very poor. Not only that but the disk began skipping half way through the film and never stopped. I would consider the other version.
One song worth it all: This song alone is worth the price of the CD: A Hundred Thousand Angels - Bliss
Awesom: This CD is great. I am a LMT, and purchased this CD to use at work. Although I do not use it at work (personal reasons) the song "a hundred thousand angels" is worth the cost of the cd. Excellent.
Very flexible, great feature set: This firewall has an excellent set of features and pretty powerful hardware for the price. I have been testing it on firmware v4.00 for about 3 weeks now. Its logging and alerting settings are some of the best I've seen. Our 3des VPN tunnels to a high-end Cisco PIX have been very stable. ICSA certification is a plus and documentation is pretty solid.I tested or researched many models from Netgear, Linksys, Cisco, Sonicwall, and Symantec before finding this unit that did everything I needed. Support (phone or email) actually gets you to someone knowledgeable. I think this unit is a great choice for small LAN/WANs up to 100 users or so.
What happened to South America?: How can a book about great birding spots not have a single mention of South America?
love it!: replaced my big ole' gray whale of a monitor with this slim, black one.Sharp and crisp - I love it! Highly recommend it.
Annoying: After a few months of having this monitor the auto adjust kept going off on it's own randomly and had to prop the button to get it to stop and then that stopped working and now a "auto adjust locked" message comes up so I'm buying a new monitor and not a samsung this time!
Review of SyncMaster 720n: This is the worst monitor you can buy. I made the mistake of buying one about 6 months ago and its already quitting on me, for example the Brightness is always all the way up and when i turn it down it goes back up. In addition to this the resolution absolutely sucks!!! and the monitor it self is blurry and not clear. My advise to you it don't buy it, there is a lot better monitors out there for a better or equal price.
Problems after 6 months.: After 6 months of using the monitor it started to develop problems. The adjustment buttons on the front of the monitor are randomly going off. It is still under warranty, but the closest repair center is 400 miles away and I have to pay for the shipping both ways! It still works, but the buttons going off by themselves are very annoying because a menu screen is always popping up.
A book that belongs only in a Army Tactical Command library.: This tome should be credited to General Fred Franks with commentary by Tom Clancy. I found it difficult to distinguish who wrote what. And a credit it is to Fred Franks for a brilliant career of personal perserverance and an outstanding performance of service to his country. But to an average reader of history, the book would have benifitted form a glossary of military abbreviations. Frankly, I got lost and eventually gave up trying to keep up. It was written by a military man for the military. As the subtitle states "A Study in Command". I'll think twice before spending money on a book with Mr. Clancy's name in the future.
Review of "Into the Storm: A Study in Command": This was a good book. It was a fancinating account of what a combat commander has to consider in all his deliberations while planning an attack or defense. The book follows Fred Frank's career from Vietnam, a VA hospital, to Desert Storm. It may bog down for some readers (like me at times) in the mechanics of tactics and strategy but it generally holds one's attention very well. One other point some may see as a detraction from the book is the Authors' tendancy to spend time rebutting what was written in General Scharzkopf's autobiography. The General was critical in some respects of General Frank's attack on the Republican Guard during Desert Storm. There is some obvious frayed feelings over this and it creeps into General Frank's writing. He makes a good case however. I would say it was well worth the price.
A good view of the Army in Gulf War, but slow at times.: The first part of the book has interesting details about the Army's transition from the problems of the 1970's to the professional force of the 1990's. Once the focus turns to Desert Shield/Storm, the book moves at a slower pace; almost too slow.Gen Franks spends too much time giving us the minute details of his planning and execution steps. Although it gives the reader a good perspective of what a general's life was like in this type of operation, I often found myself getting lost in the details (and I was there!).This is not a Clancy-type book, as we have normally encountered in the past. Also, Gen Franks too often defends past criticisms from members of his chain-of-command (Gen Schwarzkopf, etc) that may have occurred during and after the operation.An OK book if you're interested in the Gulf War or the Army of the 1990's. Not a thriller.
A Must Read For Students of Military History: This book is an excellent read for anyone who is interested in the living, breathing organism that is the U.S. Army. Tom Clancy and Gen. Fred Franks do an excellent job of portraying the team work required for any successful military operation
Boring: This book is interesting at points. The chapters regarding General Franks experiences in Viet Nam and his recovery from his wounds are very interesting. However, the book really drags, especially in the middle 250 pages. Unless you are extremely interested in the history of the army's doctrine, I would recommend skipping ahead to the end of the book. (...)
Not just about the military, it is about leadership!: This book is a wonderful book on the what went on in the mind of one of America's great generals in the Gulf War. It is also a great book on how to lead. The principles learned and recorded in this book are applicable in almost all settings - business or military. A great book to read if you lead people, learn from General Fred Franks!
Excellent Listening: I enjoyed reading the book so I was skeptical that the audio would be as good. It was. Simon and Schuster have done a great job abridging the book onto tape. The audio is crisp and clear. Boyd Gaines and Ken Jenkins do a terrific job as the voice characterizations for the book. I felt as if I were listening to General Franks himself. "Into the Storm" is General Franks' personal story of his life from Viet Nam to the victory in the Gulf War. Great listening, well worth the price. 5 hours.
The title doesn't cover the story.: Unfortunately, although I am sure Tom Clancy and Franks do try to give a spectator's view on the Gulf War too much time is spent on other aspects like Franks' military career which are interesting but are too elaborate.
Good! But be prepared.: This book by Tom Clancy is great. It gives an in depth view into command, tactical and strategic. Yet it is very hard to read if you do not read it carefully. If you are a person who reads quickly and does not take the time to absorb some of the lingo then you will hate it. If you are into the Military and have the time and patience to absorb the terms in the beggining than this book is a great read.
Dull: Some authors have the knack of writing non-fiction and creating a vibrant, readable narrative. In this category, Winston Churchill, Bruce Catton and Shelby Foote come to mind immediately. Tom Clancy's fiction is good but I found this latest of his books mired in trivia and dull, dull, dull
Excellent study in the requirements of leadership: There are a lot of books out there about leadership, but most of them are useless and stupid. This book, however, is extremely valuable as a tool to teach leadership. The book examines General Franks' life and command, and his theory of leadership.If all leaders operated as he did in the first Gulf War, then there would be far fewer problems. There is a lot of minutia and detail in this book as in all Clancy works and collaborations, but those details just go to show you how good leadership basics allow a person to lead even critical and complicated efforts.Scrap all those vapid management books that the worst managers read, and find out how a man with a proper understanding of leadership works.
This Book Will Put You to Sleep: I have read many of Tom Clancy's fictional books and have enjoyed them all. However, this book does not live up to his normal "can't put the book down" level. When he tried to use too much of the personal words of the commanders the book lost its cohesivness and became just plain boring. I will never again assume that the Tom Clancy name implies a good book!
Into the Storm:is a terrible book about a fascinating battle: I have read all of Clancy's books. He should be embarassed his name is one this one, his portion of this book is mediocre. Franks writing "style" if you can call it "a style" is not only boring but patently self serving. As a genuine war hero Franks should have used a first class writing assistant. This great battle in American War History deserves far better than this very poorly written and confusing book. Hopefully,someone of the caliber of Stephen Ambrose will give the men and women of Desert Storm what they deserve - An exhilerating fast paced action narrative history of the people, logistics and strategy of this great battle.
A tough technical slog for civilians: Clancy does a superb job of researching the techo wiz factors for his excellent works of fiction. Then he trys to turn the research notes into books. For the military uninitiated they can be a tough read. INTO THE STORM is the rebuttal to the Schwartzkof book "It doesn't Take a Hero"(?) Far too technical. I was looking foward to Clancys treatise on Desert Storm in his usual style but was very disappointed with this Military Manual.
A book for historians and researchers: This is quite simply the worst book I have ever finished. I must admit, that in places, I skimmed over the text.If you have ever been forced to listen to someone recount their golf round shot by excruciating shot, you know what it is like to read this book. It is virtually impossible to follow the troop movements without intense concentration or constant referral to the few maps included. Dry as dust.Like me, many Clancy fans will be suckered into purchasing this book on his name alone. This will be a mistake. I found no Clancy here. This book is an obvious response by General Franks (who I am sure is a fine man and an excellent soldier) to criticism levelled by General Schwartzkopf in his book on the Gulf War.If you are researching Desert Storm, this book may be helpful; otherwise, avoid this book at all costs!
just a great radio song....: This is just a great new BLONDIE single. DHarry still soundslike she did years ago, thanks I'm sure to the studio but who doesn't benefit from the studio anymore,and its a great dance/club song. Blondie was one of the firstgroups featuring a white female singer in the 80's to try rapping to their music that I can recall. Nobody was doing anything like this commerically at the time. Things have come along way? I'm not a big rap fan but I do like what Blondiedoes here and the retro feel just completes this excellentradio ready song.
The GOOD return of Blondie: 58-years-old Debbie is still impressive, her voice is passionate and Blondie... just ON TOP like they've (almost) always been. In these days people want to follow the tendencies of the early 80's to feel on top and alternative. Blondie just doesn't need to do that: they carry that atmosphere and spirit with themselves. This single is at the same time new wave and disco, and at the same time 80's and 00's. Blondie is brand new and at the same time the classic Blondie we love. The song is a wonderful born-to-be-a-hit track, with a pretty melody and infectious lyrics. The single brings remixes made by Donna Summer's friend Giorgio Moroder, an updated 80's must. The extended mix is just magic and must brig you to another level, where even on the dancefloor it was all about MUSIC. It's a magic return to form, much more impressive than the mega commercial hit Maria from their previous album.
Very nice bracelet with loose lock: I gave this 10k white gold Diamond heart tennis bracelet to my wife on her birthday. She was suprprised and very happy to receive such a nice gift. Only problem is that lock of the Bracelet is very loose so its not suitable to wear everyday.(You never know when it will drop from your hand).
Pure bossa nova: Rosa Passos is a very sophisticated singer from Brazil. Unfortunately she is almost completely unknown in her own country. In this CD she makes a tribute to Joo Gilberto (he has a 1977 album, "Amoroso").The last track has the participation of Yo -Yo Ma, cello.
A looser.: I bought this assigned text - and never used it.. It was hard to follow and not well-written. It is sitting on my bookshelf waiting to be resold to the next user.
This Book is Outside the Zone of Learnability!: If you want to learn about brain-based learning, there are easier books to read. Yes, I learned a lot by reading it, but each chapter took me 2 hours to read. My classmates agree. Many times, I'd have to read it aloud to understand it. I've been to college; later I returned for a certification in education; and now I'm getting my masters. This is the hardest book I've ever encountered!
Not the best description of the book for the price: In talking with peers, I paid too much for this book for the condition it was in. I would have said it was in low fair, maybe even poor condition.
Product Review: This product came to us is a used box. It was taped over as though it were used or pre-opened.....The size was small and was not happy with its operation.
This is not your father's Lava(tm) Lamp.: First of all I don't know if this is officially licensed from the company that makes lava lamps, but it is not the same kind of thing. It's not a dual colored liquid goop machine like a lava lamp. It's a bunch of glitter in a colored liquid. And it doesn't keep moving either. After a few hours you'll need to shake it a bit to get things moving again. It's kind of cool for a little while, but if you're hoping to relive some old memories you'd be better off with the real thing and a little incense.
Beautiful pictures and short stories are great for bed-time.: We received this book as a birthday gift and now spend each night reading two stories. The pictures are absolutely beautiful and the stories only take a minute or two to read. This book is now a permanent part of our bedtime routine. My six year old loves it and asks for it each night.
Beautiful, radiant art: My children are now grown - but they remember this book fondly, because of the beautiful art which depicts God's Light and Love on every page. I am still involved in spiritual education for children, so I recently thought to ask my own kids about this book. They would choose it for their own kids, too.Mary K
Books for children: I chose this book as a gift for a one year old. It brings alive the Bible. Very readable with pictures too.
Classic Bible Stories: My granddaughter reads her book daily. Not only has this book helped her with the Bible, but also helping her reading abilities improve.
Beautiful book: I bought two of these for my daughters, ages 9 and 11, for Christmas gifts. It's a beautiful book with gilt edged pages and colorful illustrations. It looks much more expensive than $15, it's very heavy and appears to be bound well. I hope my girls keep them and read the stories to their children when they have them. I just wish I'd bought it sooner so I could have read it to my girls when they were very little.
Great book!: I read these bible stories to my grandson and we both really enjoy them! Easy reading with great illustrations.
Excellent book: I purchased this book for my kids and they love it! They now know many bible stories as this book is easy to read and understand.
Judaism reinterpreted for the modern age: Fromm, a radical humanist (and a nonbeliever in God) still writes in the great Jewish tradition of optimism and of belief in human potential. Fromm had an excellent traditional Jewish upbringing, and although more traditional thinkers will disagree with his conclusions, they are at least well grounded in Old Testament texts.The book is a bit dated in that one of its intellectual underpinnings is the belief that human beings can perfect themselves through self-understanding, specifically through psychoanalysis. The twenty-first century has not been charitable to that conclusion.
newer version is better: The tracks on this cd are old. Newer karaoke cds tend to have better sound. The guide vocals are terrible. I would buy the newer Stage Stars accompaniment version instead if you don't need the on-screen lyrics.
Author review: Summary by author, Steve Byas.(I gave it 5 stars because I had to fill in that field to do this review---I would have preferred to leave that blank).Lance McNabb expected the assignment would offer a welcome diversion from his usual fare as a private investigator: exposing insurance scams, tailing unfaithful spouses, and litigation research. All the young and beautiful Lisa Allen asked him to do was research her family history.Lisa's grandfather, Chuck Eller, is adamantly opposed to the project. He dismisses it as "digging up bones." Lance has little difficulty in uncovering genealogical information, but he also discovers why Lisa's grandfather so strongly opposes his effort.In Digging Up Bones, we find that shaking the family tree can be downright lethal.
Crab hate it: I upgraded the crabs tank from the tiny thing it gets when you buy one on the boardwalk to an actual tank and purchased this to replace the food they sold us which was basically gone by the end of the vacation. well its been some time now since i put this in the tank and he still has not touched it at all. The only thing this crab seems to eat is the driftwood in the tank. Wont eat fruits or veggies either and im amazed its even still alive.
tweetybird mug bad ol puddy that: I have recived a tweetybird mug that was not the one I ordered from you this one has the same pic but it says tweetybird and it is only 14oz the tweetybird mug I ordered was the tweetybird mug that said Bad ol putty that how did I get the wrong mug and you should send me the right mug and I shouldn't have to pay for your mistake the tweetybird mug I ordered was 15ozthe item model # is 613500 ASIN: B000P307RE and the shipping weight is 2.2 pounds and the tweetybird mug that I recived was 2 pounds and the item model # is F731931 TWEETY please look at the words Bad ol putty this is the mug you have advertised on the intenet
girls from the big forest: Vrttin first became popular in our country in the 80's as part of the new folk movement and quickly established themselves as spokesgirls for roots music. this album captures their in their prime. Outstanding tracks are "Kyl vuotti uutta kuuta" (The village was waitin for the new moon") and "Ukko lumi" (Snow man). These girls had a way of putting you under their spell - maybe it was the Eastern-Karelian mysticism that's so hard to resist for a Finnish audience. As a time piece this album is essential - a reminder to us Finns that Vrttin could really touch our hearts and make us cry (and a moment later laugh through the tears).
B Movie.: Not a very well written movie. although the storyline is plausable, the details seem thrown together as filler. A Good looking couple though (initially).
Hideous: Only a movie for those that are gluttons for punishment. It starts out bad, gets worse, and then gets painfully bad. The only reason I got through it was because I was playing Batman: Arkham City at the same time.
If only there were more bullets flying in this film: Charles Bronson has done a remake of The Gauntlet here in Love and Bullets. Same old storyline tough cop exidrites a female prisoner brings her back so she can testify against the mob. But the Gauntlet was more satifying than this. I am sorry to say that because i'm a big fan of Charles Bronson, but i'm afraid ol charlie missed the mark here quite a bit. The only thing remarkable in this film is the breathtaking swiss alps scenery. And as for Rod Steiger has got to be the most pathetic villain in film history, a stutering mafiso in love with his mistress. Even the greats like Charles Bronson can make bad chocies at times and appearing in this terrible,boring film is one of those times.
Good scenic photography, but that's about it.: Bland thriller in which Charles Bronson must deliver gangster's moll Jill Ireland to police while assassins trail them all the way by boat, train and plane. There's little suspense in Wendell Mayes' script (he also wrote DEATH WISH 1) but attractive scenic photography makes up for the movies lulls. This lumbering film is basically just an excuse for Ireland to change wigs every ten minutes, her Southern belle accent is also particularly annoying. Does she end up taking a bullet? Could there be a merciful higher being in existance to save us from her dreadful performance? If you're curious: watch it, if not: then don't bother. It's not the sort of movie you remember well the following day. In fact the most memorable part of LOVE AND BULLETS is the last 20 seconds. So I've just saved you wasting approx 102 minutes and 40 seconds of your time.
My Jake the mallard duck: I love my Jake the mallard duck. the duck toy looks so real that I can even picture him quacking.
Truly interesting: Ok, so everyone who's heard "You Promised Me" is probably VERY tired of it.Well, perhaps you shouldn't get this album. It is laced with French and Italian influences, set to hypnotic dance beats and trancy synths.Personally I love the album. The Benassi Brothers dipped a hand for the track "Summer Souvenir" which makes it fun, exciting, and a bit psychotic towards the end.While some of the songs on this disc are similar, overall the disc is very appealing and a lot of fun to listen to. Her voice, while thickly accented, is easy and enjoyable to sing to, and the songs are simple enough to be universally understandable.I recommend it, it's a great dancey album.
Fantastic Buy!: I am in love with this cd. I had previously limited my French cds to just Alizee and a little bit of Garou, but this cd is my favorite. It has that great hit Tu es foutu, but also alot of other songs that are cathcy and fun. She has the kind of music hat you would listen to to cheer yourself up. I love it and highly recommend it to those tired of American pop and especially those who liked Alizee.
DO NOT BUY: This album stinks. Because there are two CDs, it stinks twice as bad. The only reason I can think of to explain the good reviews written about this album is that they all must be written by In-Grid's relatives. The music is so shallow and simple that anyone could go to Radio Shack, buy the cheapest electronic keyboard, press the DANCE BEAT button and a few other keys, and produce equivalent music. After hearing that same stupid beat over and over, track after track, I couldn't bear to listen to more than the first few seconds of the next track. The voice wasn't much better. If the music was good, I could deal with the voice. And, there were too many times when she ran out of words and we get to hear lots of la la la la, dum de dum dum's. Well, I don't like to pay for those either.
Excellent Album: In my mind, this album is great. From the moment i started i loved it. There are two tracks on there that break the flow of the album, Ah l'Amour l'Amour & Va au Diable. I dont like these two songs becuase there flavour is totally opposite from what we heard for the first 10 songs.The use of the accordian with the music is spectacular. If the album removed those 2 songs as a whole i would have rated it 5 stars. The songs have catchy sounds to them, you want to sing along. I dont speak french, but now i can sing it.
Pretty good picture quality.: Pretty good picture quality, though at times a little light. The Howard and Miland movies were better. This leading man was a little bland, but the story was good.
bulldog drummond: We have all the Bulldog Drummond movies that are available. This recent one does not have the same actors as the other movies. I liked the movie but I prefer the other actors in the other ones. This as the other Bulldog Drummond's was very good.
Please Mom: I love the entire v-smile line. It keeps my four year old from feeling left out when his Dad and big brother are playing their game systems, and now he can even have a big boy game like spiderman.
Vtech game: Very poor quality, it broke within 3 months, game just quit working but my other games still work so I know it is the game and not the cyber pocket.vtech has poor quality, I am also on my 4th cyber pocket but I have so much money stick into the games I hate to not have th cyber pocket. My 4 and 6 year old did love it the short time it worked.
Great Price: This toy came fast and made my son extremly happy. I looked all over Walmart and Target and could not find these toys. Yet here it was for a great price. Like I said it came fast, I ordered another one from a different company and have not recieved it yet, would use this seller again any time. Thanks!!
Great Service: I know these games have long since been replaced with new and improved but we like this system and its great for the kids.The seller was very prompt and I would buy from them again.
Speak No Evil: The absolute best album they have recorded. I can't wait for there third cd! You won't be disappointed in this cd! You will love every single song on the cd! You'll find yourself playing this cd the most of all your cd collection. They are even better live!
Good Buy: Definately worth the $15 or whatever. Trying to splice all those wires way up in the ignition would have been a major pain and taken forever, with this you just unplug the ignition harness and plug this in. Highly recommended.
"The Industry Standard Book, Period": Capt. Chase has used all his well founded resources to pull together and create a book inwhich any person who is involved in the Tall Ship industry should get their hands on! This book is well researched and laid out so the young sailor, hardened seasoned professional or the educator can use this book on a daily basis. I highly recommend this Book!
Works as it should: I installed this to replace the missing breaker plate in a Prestolite IBT distributor on a Continental F163. It fit perfectly and works fine. The only tiny complaint is that the grommet is a little too small for the hole in the distributor, so it's easy to pull it all the way through.
Underground hip hop is dead: Da Blaknix should stick to hip hop rather than underground, to gain more fame and respect. All this album ever talks about is gangstars in the club and rum. It's not a good album, not cream of the crop, if this is the path they decide to take, thier music career will fade.Don't buy this, really.
poetry from Vietnam: The poetry of Visions of War, Dreams of Peace is moving, in part because most of the poems have been written by women who were nurses on active duty during the U.S. war in Vietnam. From their position, they could speak of what they saw as the deaths continued to mount all around. Many of the poems are awkward and sentimental, many rely on limp rhymes, many wear their hearts on their sleeves. Most ache with wounds that will never heal. The authors' courageous struggle to face the eternal suffering of war, to try to find words to express how others' suffering has deeply moved them, gives some of these works a rough edge that cuts the reader to the soul.
Visions of War, Dreams of Peace: Book was advertised as "used in good condition" and that was a precise description. It was in excellent shape and arrived promptly.
A must have...: Very comprehensive book... a must have. This book will help you to understand other people and their behaviors even if you don't believe in auras.
Hair curlers: I purchased these small curlers because l could not find them any where in the shops around my city. They are exactly what l was looking for and do the job extremely well. They give a very short curl and it last's a way longer than the wider curlers. You see all good things come to those who wait.hlb
Dark and soft: I agree with the previous reviewer that the pillow is well-constructed and is covered by very soft, luscious material. However, the color is a bit darker than pictured. I am still keeping mine though.
feels creepy: I did not expect this pillow to feel like "doeskin," but the fabric is somehow both squeaky and fuzzy at the same time. It's as unpleasant as that sounds. Running your hand over this thing causes a sensation like dragging your nails on a chalkboard. Also, the pillow has no firmness. If you place it on a hard chair to sit on, it is almost as if you were just sitting on the chair with nothing between you and it. Either of these would have been a sufficient for me to return it.
Ok, I guess: They are nice pillows especailly for the price. I was looking for something with removeable covers that can go in the wash. These covers are not removeable. Spot clean only.
Traditionally good: Take my hand precious Lord gave me chill bumps,it really moved me.I used to listen to good quality music like this with my parents when I was a child.
Beautiful product: My mom opened this Christmas gift yesterday and loved it. A little early, but she is 84 and can do what she wants. It is well constructed, beautiful to look at and will be easy to place outdoors. Cannot say how well it will handle the Michigan winters yet but looks to be okay and easy to clean.
A Gem: After being disappointed by so many books that ramble and provide little guidance, this book is a real gem. It is practical, clearly organized, and the author appears to really care about making this process improvement effort work for the reader. It covers three areas: 1.Steps for Improving a process,including why each step is important and how to make these steps YOUR steps. 2. Tools for managing data, like Pareto Charts and much more. And 3. Tools for Managing team meetings, including special tools for managing chaos and ideas and more. This book is used in a master's degree program and I understand that the students love it. It has essentially everything a team needs to address and improve a process.
AMAZING VOICE and TALENT all LIVE!: Claudio Baglioni is by far my favorite Italian singer. In this CD he shows why so many people in Italy filled out his concerts! It's an incredible CD, songs are well-written and you will like most of the songs. This is an excellent choice for those who enjoy live performing as well as emotional lyrics.
Yet another re-hash from a cover band: This is not the original Little River Band. It's a latter-day cover band who still use the name, despite having no original members. And this album is the THIRD release of the same material under different packaging. How desperate can you get?
editor, do your job!: This is one of the most embarrassingly bad pieces of writing recently published in the genre. I honestly do not understand what the editor was doing or how this landed publication with Tor. The author has a tremendous amount of great ideas but he simply does not know what to do with them: in fact, he does not know how to write. The subplot is hilariously contrived. The writing itself is stacked with adverbs, adjectives and similes. There is not a single paragraph that does not need some form of reworking. Some sentences are shockingly poor. On average, this book has the tone of a slightly confused writing exercise, and I exemplify: "Then, realizing in full what he was holding in his unworthy hand, he dropped the parchment to the desk with a quiet yelp." I wish the author had been assigned a competent editor who is not afraid of using a read marker because the ideas are there. But the writing? Atrocious.
Good but not great: I'm a big fan of Brandon Sandersons work, but this one didn't have quite the polish of his others. It got a lot better midway through but some of the characters are a bit insipid and annoying. They become a great deal more interesting as the plot progresses, but that happens very slowly. It probably could have been half as long.
Elantris: Could not put this book down. So many twisting plots going on and yet each one playing on the other one. Very tender love story among all the intrigue. Brandon has an unbelievable imagination and such a way of verbalizing it. I loved this story. Would make a great movie.
a good book: I enjoyed reading the book. I have not read fantasy books for a while, and this was a nice surprise.
A marvelous read!: This book is not only a story of good and evil, but it is a story of self exploration. Well done Brandon! Everyone needs to read this book!
Great story: A little predictable but still a very good way of being distracted. A one book story is also a great concept lol. Waiting for book 14 of wheel of time. Not long now.
Elantris review: Brandon Sanderson is a wonderfully original and imaginative fantasy writer. It's like coming home, to read another one of his novels. This was no exception.
I love this world: I love the world the author has created. The intricate magic system is implemented excellently.I would love to see more books set in this world.This is one of my reread books. I've even got the dramatized audio version.
Refreshing change of pace: This is a good start to what i hope will be a long career for Mr. Sanderson. I do have to say that some parts of the novel put me off. At times the dialog just seemed to drag on as a lot of back history was given as speech. Also the names for people, places and things all started getting a little to similiar.One of the strong aspects that made me want to keep reading was the orginality of the piece. It was a totally differnt look at how magic could operate in Fantasy. Also there was a good mix of political and religious intrigue to keep me guessing on what was going to happen.The twists at the end were also a huge plus to make the book better. All in all i have to give this book a 4 star review, the dialog and general slowness of the story keeps it from being a 5. I have ordered the first book of the mistborne series to see how his writing goes from here.
Great ending...: This novel had some fabulous inventive and creative ideas in it. I hope to see better dialogue writing in the next books. Unfortunately, the dialogue was stilted and manufactured (almost painfully so), like one would find in a book for teens 10-14, for those: they would enjoy.The ending more than makes up for the contrived dialogue and slow pace. :) I WILL read more of Brandon's books. I expect him to get better and better.
A GREAT NEW ADDITION TO FANTASY: What a joy it was to finally read a self-contained 1 volume long EXCELLENT fantasy novel. The best fantasy novel I've read this year by far! Sanderson is a fine new addition to the world of fantasy. Only reason he gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because there were several parts within the novel which I thought dragged a bit. This novel is in the same league with The Briar King. Buy it! Read it! Enjoy it!
Meh: I think a hundred pages could have been easily edited from this novel. It would have helped the pacing.
Disappointing novel: Having read Sandersons Warbreaker earlier this year i was excited to read another single volume fantasy novel. I assumed that the story would be a solid read seeing as it has had solid reviews and a 4 and 1/2 star rating. I was dissapointed to say the least.The politics of the story is my only gripe, but a big one no less. It seemed that the first 200 pages were bogged down with nothing but Victorian era intrigue and politics. This is interesting if spread out in a span 100 pages, but the book seemed to focus more on the manouvering of several groups to gain the throne of a kingdom and less and characters and a true story.Extremely disapointing. I have to say that I intend on reading his Mistborn trilogy but with lower expectations than I previously had.
An enjoyable fantasy story: Elantris is the first novel by Brandon Sanderson I have read and I am now keen to read more. The story is highly imaginative and richly detailed.In places I feel it possibly lost it's way in a story sense but overall when all is said and done I was very satisfied. The characters were generally enjoyable and there are moments of real suspense in Elantris itself where an atmosphere of danger is successfully created.
Love the idea that anyone can become a god: It took me a little bit to get into it, but once the book grabbed me I was sucked it and ended up staying up later than I should have to finish it. I will be reading more by this author to see what else he has.
Fantastic book: It is agreat book that I read quite quickly as I was intrigued by the story and characters.The pacing is quite good too.I will most likely be reading more books from Brandon Sanderson.Great read and not too long.Recommended.
CRAZY good 1st book from Sanderson: WOW... Brandon is by far the man... I started with Mistborn and have finished everything Sanderson has written so far and he is crazy good.. Great book and if you like the preview of the book read it by all means!
amazingly crafty and unique: I have read Sanderson?s mist born series and really loved them. After reading this book, I find myself struggling to decide which one I like most. The unique cultures and storyline of Elantris are matched by the impressive characterization. The story is completed so well that I'm impressed by his ability to limit it to one book. I wish he would write another book about this world because it's so well done and I want to read more!
I liked it.: Good story, as with other Sanderson books most of the action happens at the end. The beginning was unusual, but effective.
Great read: Awesome book. Sanderson does a great job with creating a new style of magic. Great characters and a good complete story.
Wonderful!: The only thing bad I have to say about this book is that it ended. I felt a bond with the main characters as well as the minor ones. I felt the story was not only unpredictable but well written and unique. You have to read it to understand.
Very timely and enjoyable: I generally avoid fantasy novels, but was assured by people I trust that this one was different and well worth reading. I now heartily agree. What I most appreciated was the thorough discussion of somewhat similar faiths differing in one flavor offering convert or die as its only argument, with others (and secular alternatives) seeking Truth, rather than only victory. This has obvious relevance to our own world, as does the idea of one culture being briefly so powerful and advanced that it feels able to ignore threats better not ignored.
Great Debut Novel: Elantris tells the story of a fallen city where the inhabitants were once beautiful and possessed magical abilities. The city and the inhabitants fall from glory when the Elantrian people lose their magical abilities, their skin turns a hideous color with dark patches and any wound the receive will never heal. Elantris is a very well written novel, and is a very enjoyable read. It is filled with politics, action, and some great new ideas. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but was somewhat disappointed in the ending. I kept expecting an awesome revelation about what caused Elantris to fall- with all of the the scheming and such taking place, I was hoping for something more interesting than what was presented in the book. That is my only complaint against an otherwise great novel. Definitely pick it up.
Just Ok: This book was just Ok. In some ways it was very unique because of the setting but I found the characters to be too perfect with no flaws which made them a little boring. I found myself trying to hurry and get to the end for the big climax which was again unique but it didn't make up for the lack of character development.
Very very long with little forward momentum: I like the concept of Elantris and I bought it because I really liked Mistborn (another novel) and Orson Scott Card raves about it on the cover...This is a good idea that overstays its welcome. There is no forward momentum to the story. The merchant-king angle does not remain logically consistent. You have these brilliant businessmen who have no common sense. Tons of exposition in the dialogue. Then the ending is rushed through with several 'revelations' that seemed a bit convenient.Read Mistborn, which is a very worthy novel by the same author.
Great book: Very good book I wish there was another book to keep it going. I couldn't put it down at all
Elantris: 4.5 stars. I enjoyed this book. Brandon Sanderson is good at creating different "magic," so it isn't like the magic in every other Fantasy novel you've ever read.
Disappointment: I listen to the first disk and said this is not worth my time.I passed and I'm disappointedChuck
No Mistborn........: Listen to the reviewers who call this work contrived and even silly. I love Sanderson (Mistborn is my favorite series) but this book was hard to deal with. The idea was amazing..... but the execution is terrible. It is VERY obvious that this is his first work. The characters are flat and unbelievable and the storyline is disjointed. If you are looking for more Mistborn... look elsewhere.
not very good: I have to confess I couldn't finish it. It was too silly and unserious. I had very high expectations from having read all the glowing reviews but the book itself was awful. Sanderson can write well and tell a story well, look at his bringing the moribund Wheel of Time series back to life, but this one was a misfire.
Excellent book: I loved the way magic was used in here. I hope Brandon comes back to this storyline and writes more about it. I will now have to grab is new series and see if it is just as good.
Pretty good - worth reading: I was impressed with the level of detail that Sanderson was able to achieve in a one volume fantasy book. The story and the characters were both engaging and compelling. I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to someone looking for a good fantasy read but doesn't want to commit to a series.
It was a pleasure to read: I loved that the author went in a different direction than most. Instead of our hero's using physical strength they used their minds to deal with situations that were beyond their control. It was great to see really clever hero's.
Missing pages: If the book hadn't been missing 30 pages in the middle I would've rated the story itself as a four. Hopefully it was just my book that was missing those pages and not just a printing error. I would like to buy the book at some time but will have to look at a physical copy before I purchase.
Definitely a first novel: This was Sanderson's first novel and it shows. This book was almost embarrassingly bad compared to the Mistborn Trilogy and the books he wrote in the Wheel of Time. The characters are flat, the political and military situations unrealistic, the story is predictable, and the prose is amateur. If this was the first novel I read of his, I probably wouldn't read another.
I liked it: This is my second Brandon Sanderson book. I actually started with his most recent book,Warbreaker (Sci Fi Essential Books). That was good enough to get me to look at his other books, so I read this on my most recent vacation. It met my expectations and confirmed that I like his style of fantasy.The setting of a glorious city gone awry created a fascinating background for his tale. The lead characters had intriguing personalities and possessed great leadership skills. The political intrigue was a very key and fun part of the story. I especially liked the princess and her drive and ability to take charge of things.The antagonists were also done well, especially Hrathen. The story had enough twists to keep my interest as I read the book.I recommend this book to anyone that likes or want to explore the fantasy genre. I will be sure to read his other books.
Pink Ribbon Reeboks: I always wear Reebok walking shoes because they tend to be made more narrow -I have a narrow foot, so this is important to me. I am mostly happy with this new shoe, but it seems to be a little too roomy in the toe box, which allows my feet to rub more than is comfortable. I will try this shoe again, but probably one-half size smaller.
Reebok Women's Avon Walk athlectic shoe: What can I say, I love my Reeboks and they were everthing I expected. Box was a little crumpled when they arrived, but hey I'm not wearing the box and the shoes were in perfect condition.
another Brennan masterpiece: From the reality of a Poser, faker, and wannabe I was unmasked. Brennan writes with the authority of the hurting, downtrodden addict, and crawls into your heart with insight only achieved by being there! I have read, and given away more Brennan Manning books to men behind bars than any books beside the Bible. Brennan knows the men I minister to. He writes as one of them. He writes as if my Lord and Savior were dictating his manuscript; (which would not surprise me)!
getting better and better: With every new Laika the odds of having another great album seem to get slimmer, but they managed yet again. As always, 1 or two tracks fall out of favor soon, but the other are excellent.Main difference this time is the sound. This cd sounds way better than the previous ones. Hard to put a finger on it, but it is more open, spacious, etc. I like it better, although it takes away some of the charm of the earlier works. So, if you're new to Laika, save this one for later. To everyone else: highly recommended.
Review: Arrived on time. Kids like the movie. Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks
For Kids: I recently purchased this book for 87 cents + shipping. I should of waited for a yardsale. I have no experience in cartooning. This book is better for young children. Gives examples of what you can do, but no instructional guidelines. The tip off is that it is published by Scholastic. Considering most adults buy online I gave 1 star for teen-adult. 4 star for young children.
Teaches Antiquated Programming Style: While this book seems fairly comprehensive in terms of covering Dreamweaver's features, the author still hasn't grasped how to do modern, standards-based web design. He encourages people to use non-semantic markup ("I'm also fond of the <blockquote> tag, which indents text by a browser-defined amount...") and to abuse whiz-bang technologies in ways that make sites less usable and accessible ("Flash Button objects are great for quickly turning out a professional quality navigation system"). If you need a reference for how to accomplish a particular task in Dreamweaver MX 2004, this book may be a good choice, but if you're seeking advice on designing a web page, please look elsewhere.
you huh the what to the where?: Could not make heads or tail of it, but it's heavy... if you like heavy books. Could hold a door open.
GREAT BIBLE OF THE WEB CREATION: Not only it is a great book, but you have the sensation that somebody is explaining next to you, it is clear and precise.Great examples and terrific teaching method!!!
ZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzz: Easily the most boring textbook I've ever read. The text makes me wonder why I'm even studying urban politics.
BORING: This snorefest of a book is chock full of redieration from every other political based textbook I have ever read. This complete waste of a tree, is a pointless exercise in jargon and double speak. Spare yourself hours of trance-like boredom and buy something else.
SENSE-IBLE No-Pull Dog Harness: My sister was looking for something that her bulldog could not pull out of when they took their evening walks. I saw this on Amazon and ordered it for her, because of all the positive reviews. It works great and has made thier walks much easier and pleasant.
Textbook formatting is a disappointment on Kindle: I love this book. I highly recommend it. My problem is with the format of the Kindle version. Don't get me wrong: I LOVE my KIndle!!! Kindle is just not suited to eTextbooks. The next semester's book I got on NookStudy. The formatting was much better. I wish Kindle could format with page numbers, at least for textbooks, so that it easier for students to follow. I do not own a Nook because I do prefer the Kindle device, but I downloaded the free app for my PC. Nook does better with textbooks.
IF YOU BUY THIS, YOU'RE A CRUEL, EVIL, FOX KILLER!: Don't support the cruelness that is the fur industry. Foxes are brutally beated and skinned alive just so you can have a "good looking" jacket. And you know what, this thing doesn't even look that good. In fact, it's hideous! Save yourself from being egged and go buy a sweatshirt.
Andy's review: The book Night John was a book you truly never wanted to put down.The beginning was pretty slow because they really stretched everything outmore than it really had to be, but the ending wrapped it up perfectly.This book is about a slave named Sarny. Who was a slave at theWhite House and her master was old Waller, a very cruel man. But one daya slave named John came there. He said he wanted to teach Sarny to readand write. But old Waller was against slaves reading or writing. Sarnyand John both knew it, but John kept teaching. When Sarny learnedher first word, she wrote it everywhere in the dirt then rubbed it out.But right when Sarny was about to rub it out old Waller came and saw.Sarny just stared at him.I would suggest this book to strong 4th grade readers all 5thgrade readers and slower 6th grade readers because of how big thefont is and how short the book is. This book should only lasta week or so.
Night John: this book was great the man john came out only at night. it was exciting. shop on fire rope around neck all different stories everywhere. sad but good i give it a four out of five. if i had to choose a different book over this i would definently pick night john. I hope you like this book as much as I did.wars and brutle torcher awesome but also horrid. this is a book about slavery war torcher and convenunt as it is I liked it.
Tells you about slavery: If you read the story of Nightjohn, you will learn how it feels to be a slave. You can't read or write, but if Waller, the slaves' owner, saw you reading or writing, he would cut off your toes or fingers. Or he even might have killed you! Nightjohn, written by Gary Paulsen, was a good book.Nightjohn was the main character of the book. John was a slave that could read. He tries to teach Sarny how to read. Waller didn't want the slaves to read because he doesn't want them to get together and make an escape plan.I think someone should read Nightjohn because the book tells you about slavery. The book tells you how the slaves work, sleep, and how they can't do much stuff. This story would be good for someone who likes stories about the past
Intense and graphic: This story was assigned to me in a college class. It's content is no holds barred, graphic, and intense. I would not suggest children under 12 reading, and some would probably go with a higher age than that. The endearing story of a little girl wanting to learn to read, as taught by a heroic slave is the stuff good stories are made of. Is this a good book? Yes, no doubt. But, again, I caution the age it is ready for-do not be fooled by the small book with few pages. It says lots in few words.
the lily: This isn't a novel, it isn't even a short story. I was just getting settled in for a good read and then it ended. Definitely not worth six bucks.
nightjohn is not my type of book but it is very good: Slavery, this word is in the past but Nightjohn brings it back. it tells how cruel blacks were treated and how brave Nightjohn was to come back and teach the slaves to write and read
Night John: This interesting book holds many details on slavery, and how slaves tried to escape without being caught by their owners. This book does not have a lot of graphic details, but the author tells how the slaves were beaten, why they were beaten, and how they were healed from the whipped wounds.In the middle of the book, John, a man with cuts and scars , is sent to the main character, Sarny's field. Late at night John, teaches Sarny letters and how to read.This book is an interesting story on slavery and how John, later called NightJohn, can run away teach his own school,and how Sarny and himself were able to escape.I highly recommend you to read this book.
How Can People be so Mean?: What would you do if you never knew how to read or write? In Sarny's case, a young slave in the book Nightjohn by Gary Paulsen, she had always wanted to be able to read and write. Since she was a slave, Sarny could never learn how to read or write. She could never learn until John, a slave that her master had bought. John then began teaching her how to read and write. Quickly she learned a letter every night, when everyone was asleep. After a couple of days she learned more about John's past. She learned reading and writing until he ran North promising Sarny that we would return.I have really enjoyed reading this short and memorable story. It has really changed the way I think about slavery. It is so cruel what the master will do to some of Sarny's friends. Read this book to find out if John returns. You will not regret reading this awesome historical-fiction!
Reveiw: Nightjohn is a good book and helps you understand the suffering of the African slaves. What happens is John, a slave, learns how to read and write so... THUNK!!!! off with his toes.
this book was interesting: this book was very interesting, It wasnt so captivating at first, but when the main charecters were introduced the story became very exciting. This story told about slavery on a plantation;it is told about slavery from a young slave child named sarny who was being taught to read from a man named Night john, I recommand this book to enyone whois interested in the past and how slavery life was for the blacks. If book like these werent writen, nowone would know about this life and maybe slavery still would be in affect to this day. The neat thing is the story is true and was told from a real child, Allso reading this you learn their launguadg, Well enjoy.
Night John: Nightjohn by Gary PaulsenNightjohn is a book about a slave named Nightjohn. Nightjohn is very smart. He can read and write. He is sold to a new owner. There is a slave on the farm who wants to learn to read and write.This book is about Nightjohn's new life. He teaches a slave named Sarney how to read and write. This was dangerous because if he were caught, the slave owner would cut off either his toes or both his thumbs. After a while, Sarney got so excided about the fact that she could read and write that she wrote the words she knew in the dirt. The slave owner found Nightjohn teaching the slave how to read.Nightjohn got both toes chopped off with an ax. After that, Nightjohn took Sarney to a club he had started. There, Nightjohn continued to teach slaves how to read and write.I liked this book because of how Nightjohn teaches Sarney how to read and write. I think that this book was not so good because of the gruesome parts like when Nightjohn gets his toes cut off.
Night John: "Night John" was the best book I have ever read. Gary Paulsen books have lots of action. I want to read more of his books. The book was about a girl named Sarny who wanted to learn words from a guy named Night John. It was based on what happened in the 1800's. There were a lot of slaves and Sarny and Night John were some of them. I liked "Night John" because Sarny didn't give up on learning to read. Sarny and Night John ran into a lot of problems trying to learn to read. If you really want to read a good book, read "NIGHT JOHN". It was so exciting and you will never want to put it down.
Atrocious: How can these atrocities be promoted in this country? Zero stars. I saw poor Beth Fenimore's picture on the stoptherod site and was brought to tears. You can see the sadness and anxiety in her face from being subjected to these archaic, barbaric methods. Beth, I send hugs to you for being brave enough to write the letter and confront this sick sadistic man. There is nothing Christian about these teachings.
Roy Lessin should be imprisoned: This book is sick- there is ABSOLUTELY no reason why this book should be in print. Its an excuse and a guide to parents wanting to perform child abuse. The mental damage that discipline of this kind cause are life changing, life changing in a bad way, not creating a "happy and obedient" child. Amazon should be ashamed to sell such ridiculous parenting filth.I wish there was a zero stars option.
God's word taken out of context and beaten into children.: Again the word of a loving God has been taken out of context. This man advocates beating babies in diapers with sticks because sticks cause more pain then paddles, belts etc. He says not to be concerned about marks the spanking leaves on your child's bottom for weeks at a time!!! This is child abuse. There is nothing loving about it. What's more it's illegal.
Where's Roy Lessin so I can give him a beating: This book is sick. What kind of God will allow child abuse? And the children are born in sin comment urggghh, I don't even know what to say. If this is how all my fellow Catholics think, I'd rather not belong to this religion
Disgusting absolute child abuse: I have just read an account of a child who was raised with Roy Lessins methods of child discipline. I am appauled and disgusted that any book by this author is allowed to be on sale - anywhere !How can a book which basically outlines how to abuse your child be published let alone be available to the public ? Spanking your child is one of the initial and most outright forms of child abuse. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK AND BE SUCKERED INTO THIS SICK FORM OF DISCIPLINE. A child is brought into this world to be loved not ridiculed and harmed in this way. The author should be ashamed. If I could have given this review no stars, I would have.
What kind of vicious book is this?: p.106 "A helpful suggestion of getting the best results when giving aspanking is to have the child in a good posture to receive thespanking. When the child is small he can be bent over the parent's knee. When the child gets bigger it is best for the child to bend over a bed or a chair so that the parent is free to administer the spanking more effectively."WHAT KIND OF WEIRD BOOK GOES INTO THIS KIND OF DETAIL?p.108 "Many parents make the mistake of failing to carry through with a really hard spanking. The spanking must go beyond the point of anger. It must evoke a wholesome fear in the child."So you have to be even more than angry, you have to be out of control?This book is both vicious and weird. I feel extremely sorry for the kids that go through this "frightening" and odd bottom-intensive childhood.
Another child abuse manual: Beat the child with a rod (ie. flexible branch from a tree) because it produces the greatest amount of pain. "...bring pain in order to produce repentance." "The spanking must go beyond the point of anger. Itmust evoke a wholesome fear in the child."The message from the author is beat them hard and long, create fear in your child. Perhaps the saddest thing is that he uses God as his excuse to advocate for abusive parental behavior.One could seriously cause their child physical, emotional and sexual harm with this book. It shouldn't be sold at Amazon or at any respectable book store.
Child Abuse Is Not Discipline: It's a shame that entirely too many people spend their time reading and believing garbage like this. Educate yourselves people into how much damage this can actually do to children. Instead of taking the easy way out and abusing your children, why not actually teach them instead??? As far as people saying I had this done to me & I turned out fine, I'd be willing to bet that you turned into a violent child abuser as well. And shame on this author for making money at the expense of children's lives!!
Should be Titled "How to Be the Parents of Sad and Messed-Up Children": This book should be titled "How to Be the Parents of Sad and Messed-Up Children". This book clearly shows how to beat your children into submission and to break their spirits. It's books like these that makes innocent little children into violent adults! If you hit your children, they will think it will be right to hit others! Books like this one just creates more violence in this country! Don't we have enough violence already????
A Better name for this book is "How to Raise a Sociopath": Unless you want to raise a child with reactive attachment disorder who grows into an adult with anti-social personality disorder do not read this book or use the abusive, sadistic practices it's author suggests.
Cruelty to children advocated by ignorant author: Page after page of child-beating advice is given here. For example, he says to hit not just with a belt -- too flimsy -- use a hard stick instead [p.105]. Can anyone really picture Jesus whacking little chidren like this? The advice is dangerous, likely to have a parent end up in court, and the child turn out to be another angry person like the author.
Abuse is abuse regardless of the age of the victim.: Do you beat your spouse when they disagree with you or do you put forth a little more effort to find a different solution? Saying that it was done to you does not make it OK to do to someone else!
A MUST for Christian parents: This book teaches what 99% of Christian parents don't bother to learn: Biblical discipline and respect for children and adults. Spanking is mandated in the Bible but without proper reconcilation with the Lord and the child's parents, spanking is simply child abuse. This book helps distinguish between abuse and spanking and what parents should consider important and Biblical when deciding on how to raise their children. My husband and I are giving the books to our parents so that they understand what we're trying to do. I highly recommend this to parents who are interested in what the Lord has to say about childrearing. The principles in this book are all pulled from the Bible.
Baby Beatin' Book: If your God really condones beating innocent babies and children who are only acting their age, this is the book for you! However, if you are just browsing parenting books there are many other great books about discipline and boundaries that do not involve beating.I'm sorry, but these parents who log on and say "Thank God my parents beat me!" need some serious therapy.
Another Child Abuse Manual: This is just another child abuse manual on how to humiliate and harm a child for life! It is upbringing like this that has tormented me even into adulthood as the flashbacks go on and on. Books like these should be banned!
Gross Child Abuse: This book follows the same pattern of the author's previous book on children: strike the buttocks of infants and children with a stick, "hard enough" and repeatedly, to obtain instant obedience to whatever the parent feels like demanding, and a fake "cheerful attitude". This is abusive. To treat a human being in this manner, especially a vulnerable infant or small child, is to risk serious injury, psychological and learning problems, and later sexual perversion (spanking fetishes and BDSM). Children have been killed by using this method of "thoroughly spanking" until they "repent".Such torture methods are not the way of Jesus, or any other reasonable religion. Try reading Sears & Sears books instead.
Not Centered in Love: I had to rate this to post which is why you see one star.This book is simply not centered in Love. It is simply and cruelly about Control and exerting ones will over small children. Children are not manipulative but rather they LOVE you as their parent(s) and are excited to have you pay them attention. Loving attention hopefully but they will take what they can get. Please if you must have this book also consider reading other books such as: UNCONDITIONAL PARENTING and PLAYFUL PARENTING.As a child of very religious parents who was whipped out of "Love" I can assure you that it was not love I felt then or now. It was Fear.Raising my child with Love and Respect I am amazed at the difference. I am mostly over the grief of my own lost childhood because I see in my own child that I am breaking the cycle.
Another baby-whipping book?: Since time immemorial, every form of bigotry has had its defenders and promoters. The more wide-spread the particular problem, the more quacks and hucksters there are who mount pulpits or break into print to justify the behavior in question. They know that by pandering to peoples' most shameful impulses, they can earn fame and fortune. In the past, they defended plantation owners' right to own slaves, husbands' right to beat wives and jailers' right to flog convicts. They defended racial segregation and religious discrimination. Today they defend and promote adults' right to assault and batter children, more commonly known as "discipline," "spanking," "smacking," etc. Author Roy Lessin is a member of that crowd. My advice to readers who might be considering his "How to be Parents of Happy, Obedient Children," is this: don't waste your eyesight, don't waste your money.
Comprehensive Jewish Magazine: I look to Moment Magazine to get a sense of Jewish issues. They offer a wide range of articles about Jewish politics, culture, and religion. Moment makes Jewish life exciting, and always finds quirky angles. They also offer an excellent range of viewpoints on all these topics. Particularly on Israel, they are able to convey the complexities of the state with all its strengths and problems.
Sad,in a acting and content sort of way.: It seems that most of the B westerns of the thirties were full of bad acting with weak sound.Even the old John Wayne films of the era were of poor quality.But this story would have made a good paperback read.The movie was full of poor acting with the actors appearing to be reading the lines at times.But in 1939 I would have had a great afternoon at the theater with everyone else.
Mislabeled by Amazon: When I received this it was "Mirror Glaze 85" instead of 80 as advertised. This makes quite a bit of difference in the cutting power. I gave it a rating of 1 because of this.
no quality: I ordered 4 different Cando flexible hand bars: red (light), green(medium), blue(heavy), and black(x-heavy). All four colors felt about the same. To check my sense of feel I measured the force required to bend the bars to 90 degrees. The forces were as follows: red- 10.2 lb, green- 8.2lb, blue- 11.2lb, black- 10.4lb. The Cando bars appear to be trying to compete with the There-Band "Flexbar", which come in three colors and stiffnesses red(light), green(mid), and blue(heavy). Using my measurements the force to bend these bars 90 degrees are red- 2.3lb, green- 4.3lb, blue- 6.5lb. I am using the bars to do "eccentric" contraction exercises for tennis elbow. I find the green Flexbar good for me. All the Cando bars are too stiff. It is clear to me that there is no concern about quality by the makers of the Cando bar. How else could one explain that a "light" red bar having about the same stiffness as a black "x-heavy" bar.
BEWARE!!! SELLER REFUSES REFUNDS: I bought the "green" model which is supposed to be "medium" strength. I opened the package, tried it out and it was ridiculously hard to bend, am I am a big guy....6'1 and 190 lbs.Having read other comments here about the quality control being way off, it wasn't surprising. Anyway, I returned it to the seller at my expense "The Therapy Connection" and they said since I "openened" it, it is now "used" and they won't accept it back. They said I should have "tried it while it was inside the plastic"???????? Are they serious? WHAT A RIPOFF!!!!! Now they are unwilling to send this useless piece of junk back to me unless I Pay for shipping again!!!DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU ARE 100% SURE YOU KNOW THE COLOR YOU WANT! YOU WILL BE STUCK WITH IT.
poor quality control: I found the same thing as the other reviewer. I only bought two: Black (x-heavy) and Blue (heavy). My thinking was that I'm a big guy so I might need the x-heavy one, but I wanted to make sure that I got one that worked (for tennis elbow) so I also got the next one down on the force scale, the heavy one. I was surprised to find that the Blue bar that was supposed to be easier was harder to bend than the Black bar. Both bars are too stiff to be used for tennis elbow. Having wasted my money on a product that didn't come close to working I'll try once last time with the Thera-Band product (hoping that I pick the right one).
Theraband product is better: I bought these as an inexpensive alternative to the Theraband bars. They are not of the same quality. I bought a green and a red one. There is not much difference in the resistance. They are much stiffer than the Therabars and more difficult to use. I was hoping to recommend these to my patients, but instead I recommend the original Therabars which are more expensive, but also more effective.
Syntax: Compared with other translations of Confucius this one suffers from a singular handicap. The syntax of the English translation is simply not English. I assume that it attempts to mimic the Chinese syntax, but the effect is to render most of the passages nearly unreadable for an English speaking reader. Unless you need to have the original Chinese on hand, this book is inferior to most of the others I have read.
An excellent resource: The Analects of Confucius. Published by MobileReference (mobi)This translation is a pleasure to read for both its language and its profundity. I would consider it a first choice for anyone serious in studying the analects. Great ebook!
Amazon is again misleading: The reviews here are for the Simon Leys' translation and notes. The Kindle version is a completely different translation, by James Legge. And there are no notes.
Book is Missing Pages 33-40: I received this book yesterday as it is required reading for a college course I'm taking. I just realized that pages 33-40 are missing. They are not torn out, they are just not there. This book seems to be in new condition otherwise, and I believed it was new when I bought it. I'm thinking it may have been a printing problem. Extremely disappointing.
Turned off by translator's comments: I can't read Confucius in the original so I really can't speak to the accuracy of Simon Leys' translation (or should we use his actual name - Pierre Ryckmans?). But without a doubt he feels it is the standard against which all others should be measured, as he constantly passes judgment in his Notes section on all who have gone before and finds each generally lacking in some way. Add to that his efforts to impress the reader with the breadth of his literary knowledge and his decidedly conservative social comments (another reviewer also commented on his anti-gay bias) and I'm left with a translation I would just as soon skip.
Completely unprofessional translation: One of only two things I've ever went to the trouble to return to Amazon.com. I bought this translation because it was recommended in "Confucius Lives Next Door". Unfortunately, Mr. "Leys" goes out of his way to be homophobic in his footnotes. I've heard a lot of adjectives used to describe minority groups in my lifetime, especially since I live in the Midwest but "grim" is a new one (page 126). I am surprised that such a progressive company such as Amazon sells a book that incites such negativity about a minority group. Can anyone recommend a professional translation?
Boney M Review: I first heard of a song on this cd while watching a movie, "Into the Void". I had to hunt down the song and found it on this cd. I was reluctant at first to buy the whole cd, but was very pleasently surprised. I love every song the album. I would recomend it to anyone who loves dance music from the 70's.
The Greatest Hits-Boney M: For the past couple of holiday seasons I would hear a Christmas song played on radio stations but could never find out the name of it or the artist. Finally, this past season I found out it was called "Mary's Boy Child/Oh My Lord by Boney M. I had never heard of the group but a search revealed that they were popular in the 70s mainly in Europe. After further searching I found their Greatest Hits CD on Amazon and ordered it thinking that Mary's Boy Child would be the only song I liked. In fact, I really like the entire CD. Really glad I found and ordered it...I listen to it often.
very short!: Certainly not worth 9.95! About 2 pages of information - most of which is found easily elsewhere. No full summary of his contribution.
Somewhat disappointing . . .: I really liked the d20 Ravenloft book, but this one fell short. It only covers about half of the lords and includes a prestige class that should have been in the first book. Here, the class just takes up space that could have been better used with more darklords. Or, better yet, they could have made the book bigger to include more of the lords. I would have gladly paid more for a more complete work.On a positive note, the updated stats for the lords are useful and necessary for a Ravenloft game. And we do get new artwork for Azalin and Azrael . . .
The worst service I ever had: They didn't send me the Gamemaster Screen, and I wrote some times but I haven't it yet. Ah, and the cover was different... the worst bought that I had by Amazon in all these years.
Great!: Fans of humorous writing argue as to whether Thurber or Twain is the greatest American humorist. I vote for Thurber. The Carnival is the best collection of Thurber. Read it and you'll go looking -- happily -- for everything the collectors had to leave out for lack of space.
A great book is timeless: Actually, I purchased "The Thurber Carnival" for a friend who used to raised bloodhounds and who has a great sense of humor. Very shortly after I sent it to him, he called to say that he had read it from cover to cover, enjoying it immensely, getting many laughs, and loving the sketches of bloodhounds (altered somewhat). My father loved James Thurber and collected many of his books, including this one. Its stories are timeless, and I was fortunate to have found a hardcover copy in such excellent condition!
THURBER!!!!: The works and cartoons of James Thurber have had quite an influence on me over the years. At a very young age I was drawn to his cartoons (pardon the pun), and as I grew older developed a great appreciation of his writings. Decades after their inception, his works ring true.
Thurber by a golden oldie: I first came across Thurber when I was 18 in 1943. The books were in hardback and of course very cheap in those day. I sampled one and then bought the rest. Thurber is very witty, very funny and is easy to relate to. His drawings are wonderful - simple and look so easy. I liked the essays and I loved the cartoons - the one I like best is a chap introducing his wife to a friend 'That's my first wife up there (she is crouching on top of a bookcase and this is the present Mrs Harris.' Another lovely one is a couple in bed with a seal above the headborad and thei wife is snarling 'All right, have it your way -you heard a seal bark.'Thurbers dogs are so evocate. His humour and give my three grandsons the Thurber Carnvival which they are all enjoying.
Do not sleep on this: Aceyalone of the freestyle fellowship is an unique indivisual. He has numerous styles that he dispalys on this album. I believe that this album was as unique as they come. You wont't hear anything about bling bling on this album. I like to call it abstract rap. Each song has a message of it's own. "Mic Check" is clearly th best song on the album. This album, without a doubt is worth checking out.
if HAL2001 and Racter teamed up to make an album: After hearing and bouncing to several songs in a local music store, I spontaneously bought this very fun CD. With robotic voices, thumpy beats and a heavy synthesizer, it's the sort of thing that any child of the eighties would love. And yet, it's not at all retro.Satisfaction, the first single off the album, has this Stephen Hawkings robotic voice singing a duet with a female robotic voice. That woman's voice is present on the rest of the album. I also like the introductory monologue that starts out "No Matter What You Do". Although many of the songs have a similar sound, they are all very catchy and have me tapping my feet to the beat.The album is aptly titled Hypnotica, and this album could equally serve as a background to work or for dancefloor anthems.
Not for techno fans: I purchased this CD because Satisfaction was catchy. Unfortunatly, the rest of the album wasn't as great. All the songs pretty much sound the same, and lack the variety in beats that Satisfaction offers. I wouldn't buy this for more than $5. I could get on a DJ'ing program and whip this album out in less than a day. You've heard one song, you've heard them all. I'm a HUGE techno fan, and thought this would be a new DJ I could add to my collection. Unfortunatly, I think this is gonna be a CD that gets more dust than spin time in my CD player.
satisfing: Anybody who is in to techno will love benny benassi, he providesa real type of beat and provides a emotional reaction instantly.Pick it up!!
An example of bad techno: Well i'm a huge fan of dance music in general and i liked "Satisfaction" so i thought the rest of the album would be fun too, but the rest is a repetitition of tye hit single. They all sound the same, i got the feeling that it didn't take them very long to record the album either. Sure, Daft Punk got their sound and so got Modjo and other artists but this is crazy, the songs areso simular it's annoying. First those computerized beats frtom "Satisfaction" then robotic voices. That's pretty much it. 2 songs were a little diffent from the rest though, but not enough for buying the album.
Talk about repetitive.: You know when you hear about how an album all sounds the same, and it usually really doesn't - or if when it does, it's in a good way because you love that sound? Well, this is not one of those albums. What compelled to get this album because of the club hit 'Satisfaction', which is an addictive song to say the least, thanks to it's heavy bass beats. This whole album, however, is not so addicting. The whole thing sounds like Satisfaction regurgitated. The only other songs I really favored was 'I Love My Sex', and 'Don't Touch Too Much' - but even so, buying the whole album just didn't seem worth it. You might want to stick with the singles for this one.
Hypnoti-Caca: Like a lot of folks, I bought this CD based on the strength of 'Satisfaction' after hearing it on that Wendy's commercial. I can listen to that ditty over and over again... Problem is, when I start up track 2, it's the same song. We repeat that pattern for the next dozen tracks. Don't get me wrong - I like a lot of similiar artists (The Prodigy, Chemical Bros), but I was expecting a collection of songs and not just a remix of the same thing for an hour. Just down load track 1 from iTunes.
So Uncomfortable!!: Well, the first thing that sucked about these shoes were that they came in and felt way too small. I am a size 9, and I honestly could not believe what I got was a size 9. My toes felt so cramped. I couldn't wear these shoes all night, they were far too uncomfortable. Also, the way they wrapped them made the part that goes up your leg look weird and warped. They did look good, I'll give them that, but the pain wasn't worth it. The arch on them is so extreme and the material so slippery, that your feet push forward, causing your toes to spill out the front. I think that's what made them feel they were too small. They just aren't made well at all. They're made to look good, and comfort wasn't taken into account here. So, if you can deal with a lot of pain, get em. If you're like me and you'd rather be able to wear them all night without crying, then get a pair of flat roman sandals if this is for a greek or roman costume. Believe me, they feel so much better!!
The Beauty of "Wide Open Spaces": Texas, the state known for its "wide open spaces," is also known for producing great saxophonists, most notably Ornette Coleman, Illinois Jacquet, Arnett Cobb and Booker Ervin, but also the underrated James Clay and David "Fathead" Newman. When "Cannonball" Adderley began producing for the Riverside label, he made it a point to record the less recognized of his colleagues. As was the case with Don Wilkerson's "The Texas Twister" (see my review), Adderley brought in a superb rhythm trio to support tenormen Clay and Newman on this April 26, 1960 session -- Wynton Kelly on piano, Sam Jones on bass and Art Taylor on drums. "Sound of the Wide Open Spaces" is an all standard affair with the Babs Gonzales penned title track and "What's New," which showcases Clay on flute, the disc's strongest moments. "Wide Open Spaces" is a solid post-bop album, and being that the disc is a 2002 release, I'm delighted to see that there are still gems in the OJC vaults to be reissued.
Bought for my little princess first birthday party: My daughter's first birthday party was princess themed so I searched for a little princess costume for her to wear. I came across this Pink Ballerina Princess costume and loved it from the picture. When it arrived, I thought it was as joke. There was no way this 12-18 month costume was going to fit on her. My daughter was average size for her age so it shouldnt have been a problem. I ended up giving it to my friends 5 year old who puts it on her dolls. One of the worst buys I've made online.
Divine Nepotism - Naked Truths Revealed: In 'Divine Nepotism', Ms. Lewis has given us her truths, baring her soul and emotions. Having done so in such an honest, down-to-earth voice, Tracey Michae'l moved me with her words. Her poetry challenges us to dig deep, to go beyond the surface of what we think we know and/or feel. "These Things Called Poems", "Love Letter (Part II)", "Untitled", and "Loaded Kiss" are among the poems that have me awaiting more from this talented writer. Well done Sis. Beautiful things are possible when we stop fighting the voices within us.
Knotting like a Pro: I purchased this video directly from The Bead Shop's website and learned everything I ever wanted to know about knotting. Not only does the instructor(Janice Parsons, owner of The Bead Shop) have decades of knotting and beading experience, but she also knows how to explain and demonstrate this normally hard-to-learn technique in a clear, consice and easy to catch on manner. She demonstrates how to knot the way the professionals do, without tools. The best thing about having it on video is that it allows you to rewind and reference it at any time. I recommend this video for the beginning knotter and even for a seasoned beader. It is a great refresher course and with practice, you are sure to catch on to this useful beading technique.
getting the job done: Packers Pine Tar Soap is all it says it can do. Makes yout skin and hair soft and it really works the way it claims. Used it as a child. Now my garnd daughter uses it. Job well done
Packers Pine Tar Soap: This product is as good as I remembered it from my youth, lots of cleansing suds and the beautiful scent of pine.It's like showering in the middle of a pine forest and your hair is totally clean with no chemical residue.
A cutie!: Love this little guy! Got one for a co-worker's little boy, who absolutely adores it. So I picked this one up for another co-worker's baby shower. The bright colors are attention grabbing for the little ones. And in my opinion, no home should be without a Jabber Parrot!
Fascinating, useful, and well-written!: ... This is a great history of social entrepreneurs, military leaders, and other great strategists who figured out how to get what they wanted. Great short chapters on Joan of Arc, Patton, Alice Paul and the suffragists, Japan, and even Picasso and Matisse. Turned out for me to be an excellent source of fun cocktail party chatter. But it is a very very good and unusual kind of self-help book. Yes, the book is NOT about military strategy, but is is about strategy in personal life. I thought it was better than a ton of other popular history or self help books. It helped me understand how to be more successful at figuring out how to get what I want. On the cover General Wesley Clark calls this a "very important book" and I agree!
Essential Read: Turns standard business strategy upside down. An essential read for anyone seeking an alternate perspective. You might just find that the alternative perspective regularly beats the mainstream.
Glib and deceptive: The title is deceptive. The book does not focus on the strategy of Napoleon beyond the second chapter.The often repetitive book (I found several instances of wholesale cut & pastes of text) reduces great thinkers of strategy to two sentence summaries.It never clearly argues its point, and in the second to last chapter outrageously refers to the stories of Christian saints as "fables".I'm sorry, but a member of a strategy group in New York City, in this century, looking back on the whole of human experience in war and religion reducing great thinkers and profound events to short glib interpretation is OUTRAGEOUS.
aliens..not like us...from another planet..in outer space...: The second season of Outer Limits is often dismissed by serious fans as a disaster best forgotten. The crew, visual style, all had changed. However, allthough not at all like the original series, it stands out on its own thanks to classics like "The inheritors" and "The demon with a glass hand".The majority of the 17 second season episodes are, however, mediocre and some are downright awful. The Probe, the very last episode, is one of the worst. There is enough plot to fill ten minutes, and the cast fills the time by going through some absurd, senseless dialogue. It seems like it was written overnight. The story premise itself (an alien probe examining earth) isn't that bad and could have been the basis for a great story.Sad to see Mark Richman so lost..he was great in "The Borderland". It's also unbelievable that writers Seeleg Lester & Sam Neuman were also behind the awesome "The Inheritors". I bet they wrote this turkey in a hurry.
Don't buy: A gorgeous watch but very low quality. I got this watch as a gift, only wore it to the office, and always took good care of it. Perpetual calendar took a couple of months (!) and multiple visits to the store to settle down. It then broke twice over less than two years, each time costing $350 and taking a few months (yes months) to repair. I eventually gave up. Omega service, at least in New York, is despicable. Keep away. My other watch, a $45 Casio, never gave me any trouble even though I race triathlons with it.
The Perfect Sound Track For Race Day: This is a must for the CD player while you are sitting in race day traffic. "What Else Would I Do On Sunday" is my favorite, along with the song about Dale, Sr.Warning -- if you are a fan of the "new age" of NASCAR, this isn't for you. It's country to the core, and respects and honors the sport's "Old Dawgs." If you like Tony Stewart and rap music, buy "Crank It Up."
It's okay: I purchased this CD just for two songs - Once Upon a Dream and My Hawaii both are songs that I love but I have to admit both songs are a bit dated. Singin' the Blues Too Long is the only other song I care much about. The rest is just filler in my opinion.
Very,very creepy: In case any of you are wondering,this book is a sequal to an earlier book of Ms. Dillard's:TOS #30:Demons(look for my review on this book also).The two book have basically the same storyline(aka. energy beings that feed on fear invade the Enterprise)but not the same plot.This book was definately chilling.The author really makes you feel Deanna's instense fear of these creatures.Like its prequal,a MUST read!
Better than the original.: This book is a sequel to the original series book #30, "Demons". I hadn't realized that fact until I read some of the other reviews here, and was prepared to blast Dillard for simply filing off the serial numbers and putting the same plot into a Next Generation novel as had been used in an earlier book; I can only plead in my own defense that it's been a LONG time since I read that book. This book is much better-written than that one, though; I suppose that Dillard matured some as a writer in the intervening years.It would have been nice if that continuity had been more specifically referenced, although in retrospect I can see that it was hinted at. Also, I am dubious at a concept that I'm unwilling to discuss here because it would be an unnecessary plot spoiler. But this was close to a five-star effort. Definitely a fine story.
poor quality printing: This is a print out of the Internet Archive scanned version of the book from a copy held by the University of California Library. For some reason it is in large print, with large margins and they didn't even bother to orient the page numbers properly, all they would have had to do is select "left bind" in the advance tabs in the printer options. If you just want the text you can get it for free on Google books.
Dazed and Confused: This guy doesn't know the difference between a philosopher and a filafel. Anyone with a glimmer of a formal training in philosophy would know it. He uses some philosophers' names to prove the most mundane of points that require no citation at all while using others with the deft of a second year graduate student."Disoriented"? You bet.
Circular Reasoning; Argumentum in Circulo; Fallacy of Redundancy; Tautology: The guy believes in God but technically the only reason he believes in God is because Bible says so. It is called "circular reasoning" and that kind of discussion never takes you to the result. Most of the examples and paragraphs are based on Bible.I don't believe in Bible that's the reason I am reading a book about religion, what makes you think I believe in this time ?Summary of the Book;-Is there a God?-Yes.-How do you know?-Because the Bible says so.-How do you know the Bible is correct?-Because it was inspired by God.
Great book: Awesome book by John Stott. Very detailed and clear explanation of being a true christian. Highly recommended to everyone even if you are a believer or not.
Why I Am A Christian: Well written! The author's reasoning is categorized, and is presented in a logical progression. Inspirational--and just what I was looking for.
aaahhhhhhhhh.... Sonic Nirvana: When I first heard this album 30 years ago it blew me away -- and when I listened to it again tonight it blew me away still. The musicality of it is wonderful, for sure: but what matters to me most is its breathtaking (and giving) sweep of emotion. I challenge anyone to listen to "Yet to Be" and remain unmoved. Simply one of the most beautiful pieces of modern music ever recorded. Ralph Towner is a creative genius -- and this album pure pleasure.
Not as advertised: The product is advertised as leather grain pigskin gloves. I received leather gloves. I have purchased the pigskin gloves in a store before, and they are much nicer. It was not worth the hassle of trying to return what they sent me, but I would not use this seller again.
Look good, but don't last: Upon trying on these gloves for the first time I was impressed with their quality and was confident that they wouldn't come undone at the seam along the index finger (since there was no such seam on the gloves). The gloves seemed sturdy enough, but after only a few days of hard work the leather in the area of my thumb and index finger tips was worn through, making the gloves ineffective for their intended purpose.Overall, I am disappointed with these gloves and would never purchase them in the future. My leasson learned is that "real leather" doesn't necessarily mean real durable. I will only be purchasing gloves with reinforced fingers tips going forward.
Great gloves: I do industrial construction and fabrication for a living, let me tell you, these gloves can rock and roll! Wells Lamont offers cheaper gloves that provide just as much (if not more) protection for your hands but these are my favorite. Why? They are comfortable, quick to put on and off, they provide great protection (grazed my hand with a 4 1/2" grinder, the gloves are still fine, so is my hand), oh, and did I mention comfortable?I work with a lot of sharp metal, all thread, glues, silicone, paint, PVC, just about everything, and these gloves haven't failed me! In fact, I'm going to buy another pair right now.
Great gardening gloves: I purchased these gloves and they are exactly what I was looking for in a gardening glove. They fit well and after the initial use they are very supple. They offer great protection while working with thorny plants like roses or burberries but allow enough felxability to pull small weeds. The velcro closure holds the glove snug on your fingers so they don't move arevound while you are working.
Fit great, but not for long.: This was my second pair of these WL work gloves. I really like the fit and the grip is excellent. So what's not to love? Unfortunately, these gloves don't last more than a few uses. My first pair broke down after 4 or 5 uses, which I thought had to be a fluke. The second pair wore out the finger tips after being used 3 times in the fall to stack firewood and clear light brush. My guess is that any contact with moisture weakens the leather to the point that it just disintegrates.
good all rounder glove: Comfortable,can feel things good screws,drill bits etcUsed while backer boarding a bathroom.Worked well but rough wonder board scuffed the leather fairly easily.Good all round glove carpentry,tools,gardening(non abrasive)
Good gloves: I bought these for my boyfriend and have a pair in womon's size and we both really like them. The leather is soft and relatively thin so you can actually feel what you are grabbing. The fabric on the back of the hand has a nice stretch to it for a good fit. If you want to do some heavy duty work, these will wear out on you faster than thicker gloves. We use them for yard and gardening work; more for times when you don't want to get splinters, stickers or spider bites. Great quality for a good price. Would recommend and will buy again.
Covers 3 Albums from the early 70's: This covers 3 RCA albums by Castor from 72/73. If your're like me, the Rhino Best of loses steam after "Bertha Butt Boogie" and the Disco era moves in. Castor's disco records weren't as good as his funk ones. So, this CD doesn't have "Bertha" or his first hit "Hey Leroy You're Mama's Callin' You", but it's a tight, funky collection of his RCA years. These were arguably his best years. Not all of this is funky. There's a smooth instrumental remake of "First Time Ever I Saw You're Face". And there's a couple of straight up Soul songs. As a companion to the Rhino collection this is a must if you like that CD. Only 3 songs are duplicated from the Rhino CD. There's liner notes and great sound. So, this is indeed a great collection for Castor fans to own.
Nice sheets, good price: This is a nice King sized set of sheets. An excellent buy for the price. Just wash and use.
Awful Sheets: I purchased two sets of these sheets because of the low price. WASTE OF MONEY! Where our bodies touch the sheets, it turned a pinkish color. My 3 yr old daughter sometimes sleeps with us. When she slept on these sheets, she woke all night coughing. I am guessing these sheets are treated with some kind of chemical which caused the color change and cough. (Some are treated with chemicals to prevent wrinkling.) We replaced these sheets with more expensive 100% Egyptian cotton sheets. The very first night, I didn't hear a peep out of my daughter. These sheets are now being donated to the local homeless shelter.
Sleeping on poliester at any price is not good.: They may look pretty but, I would not sleep on these at any price. They truly feel like poliester. I know they are part cottton & poliester but, it is not the cotton they we felt.
Pure plastic: Strangely the sheets set is packaged with a label that states: 60% Pima and 40% cotton. They feel like they are 100% plastic.
These are the sheets for you if you sleep on sandpaper!: I have washed mine a few times and they are very rough. They are a poly/cotton blend, but I mostly feel the poly! They are a waste of my $$$. I will try a different brand and maybe pay a bit more for a good night's rest!
Feels like 100% !!: I have these sheets - queen-sized. They are 40% polyester but truly feel like 100%!
The Worst Sheets I Ever Bought: Don't let the brand name and thread count fool you, as they did me. These sheets are stiff as a board! I'm highly dubious that washing them would make much difference, so my set is going straight to the thrift store. And I, too, found the "60% Pima, 40% Cotton" label amusing--whatever they're made of, they feel distinctly unnatural! I'm glad that I bought them during Amazon's Friday Sale, so at least I didn't pay full bore.
Don't waste your money on these sheets: Just as some one said, these are pure plastic, not at all soft and not worth even 19.99 with free shipping. Even after couple of washes they apprear to very harsh.
Does not fit 2 + 2 trim: I ordered this and received it after removing the old exhaust on my 1990 300ZX 2+2. Didn't fit. Checked the Borla web site and they state that they do not make a cat-back exhaust for the 2+2 trim. Returned to Amazon for refund. Don't get me wrong, its a nice looking product just doesn't fit 2+2 trim.
TOUGH TENOR: The product information neglects to tell you of the contributions of little known Jimmy Forrest-like tenor man Claude Bartee, without which the mellow tracks may have turned out to be a somewhat dull affair.
Awesome blanket! So soft!: I love this blanket! It is so cute! It is easy keep and very soft. It keeps my baby boy warm and happy!
comfy and warm: This blanket is comfy, warm and also soft against bare skin. The teddy bear motif is a nice change from having a gender specific colour. Washes well and stays soft even without adding any softener to final rinse or in dryer.
Love the design and softness: I bought this blanket because I live in a city that requires air conditioning all the time during the summer it reaches 124 degrees so it can get cold inside the house and this blanket is light in weight and keeps the baby warm without him being uncomfortable, this was very important to me since he was very small. I would highly recommend this product for cold places or when you take baby outside or just in case.
Soft and Warm: I thought this blanket was so soft, that I know my son will love to be attached to this one.
So Soft...: Very soft and comfy blanket; I washed it according to the instructions and it came out of the dryer like new.The only issue I have is that the print/teddy images on the blanket are blurry; Besides, that it's a very comfy blanket.
Very soft: This blanket is the perfect addition to the blue jean teddy set. This blanket is very soft, my daughter loves it. when washed it doesnt leave all the lint some soft blankets do. Stays soft wash after wash. doesnt get fuzzy. Great for the little ones!!
Vocals good, Music Synthesized: The vocalists that sing on this album are quite good - but since I have the cast album, I bought this album for the karaoke tracks. The karaoke tracks on this album are entirely synthesized -- while they were OK for being synthesized (not sure they're in the show key), I prefer the live musicians I had heard on the Stage Stars karaoke Annie (Also available from Amazon). If you want to see what I mean go to each manufacturer's site and listen to the excerpts they have posted.
Number #1 Rascals Recording: I had this LP in college and wore it out. When it came out on CD I was thrilled. Gene's guitar riffs on "Since I Fell For You", and "More" are awesome, and his solo on "What Is The Reason", is my favorite guitar solo of all time. I saw the Rascals in 1966 at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh PA. Felix had a long robe on, he looked like Jesus!
Intelligent lesson of social cause-and-effect.: A story told in rhythmic language about how we (as animals) react to each other emotionally, presented as an African folktale. This book presents some basic concepts like counting and animal sounds that allow younger children to become involved with the story, while older children will relate to the emotional lessons. I haven't seen this book since I was a child, but I have forgotten neither the artwork nor the story, which reminds us that even the most casual remark or action will have an enduring effect.
This book is not out of print!: If you can't get it from Amazon get it from www.vegansociety.com/shop it's one of The Vegan Society's best sellers.It proves with scientific research based on Human studies( Not animal testing) that with a healthy vegan diet you can have up to an extra 10 years of healthy life.
J & E atkinsons i coloniali velveting hand cream with rice oil: i used to work at a company that distributed and sold i coloniali products and was hooked on the hand cream with rice oil. when they company was sold i bought as much of the hand cream as possible that we had in stock and after 4 years finally ran out. the only thing i don't like about the product is the price I have to pay now but will probably continue to purchase it. seems like this is the only brand that has rice oil in their product. And when i order from amazon i get what i ordered, delivered on time and mostly it gets deliveried earlier than promise which is great! please thank the employees who make that happen.thanksrachelle priebe
Shipping weight 1 pound??: Can anybody who has bought this mirror tell me if this shipping weight is correct? this mirror really weights 1 pound??
This should have gotten more attention...: This album was released on Wrong Again Records shortly before the label went out of print, leaving very few copies available. Luckily, its still available on import (for now), and it is a very good record, with a lot of emotion in the music, in the vein of Dissection or In Flames. If your not sure about sinking $30 down for one CD, check out the WAR DANCE compilation, it has a track off this CD and its only like 10 bucks. PS: Amazon lists tracks 5 and 6 as being "Demons", but track 6 is actually called "Fallen".
Run!!!: I can't figure out why everyone ranked this CD so high. There is much greater Nordic death-metal out there. This CD sounds flat, uneventful, and poorly composed overall. Much better music exists from this region (i.e.: Gardenian, Soilwork, In Flames, At the Gates, Edge of Sanity, Entombed.....), which is why this represents a 0 impact for such a talented sector of the death-metal compass. If you're experimenting with Northern European death music, this CD is an unwise purchase.
Synthetic top is kind of nice: For some reason I thought I was getting a 3/4" wood top table, but was a little surprised to get some sort of plastic top. Apparently this is an outdoor table. With several young children I decided that it wasn't all bad - especially since I was 2 hours into a 3 hour assembly process. There isn't quite the same soft tapping there is with a wood table, but it is considerably lighter and cups left on the table won't raise wood rings.The undercarriage is as solid as I can imagine a 190 lb. table can provide, but the table sways when 5-year old children lean against it. While I wouldn't want to repeat the assembly process, the end result was worth it and our whole family played (or began learning to play). The paddle and ball holders in the center are really handy.
Not as advertised!: The frame on this table is sturdy, but the blue top is not synthetic. It is just pressboard with a thin veneer glued on top. It would not do well in outdoor conditions, as is stated in the product description.
tt table: table has uneven bounce. I had $200 table from sears which had better bounce that this table.
Excellent table for the money: For the money I paid for this table I have no complaints.This isn't a competition level table but its not a cheapy either. The blue color is really nice.Buying through Amazon gave me piece of mind on the product condition and reliable delivery.
Libro bastante informativo: El libro provee informacion valiosa que explica paso a paso los pormenores y pormayores del embarazo detalladamente, tanto para estudiantes de medicina como para el publico general.
Excelent sorce of Information.: It give you step by step all you want to know about that important period of the parent life.
EXELENTE LIBRO.: MUY BUEN LIBRO PARA CUANDO UNO ESTA EMBARASADA LO AYUDA MUCHISIMO A MI ME AYUDO MUCHO..... BUENISIMO, INTERESANTE, QUE MAS SE PUEDE DECIR DE ESTE LIBRO??? EXELENTE.
A Good Marriage Doesn't Just Happen: I found this book to be very helpful in making a good marriage. There is nothing new in this book but it is the obvious we sometimes overlook. The book covers so many different areas that are pertinent to having a good, lasting marriage. It is written in an interesting format with many couples being interviewed about their marriages. The interviews are very truthful and not sugar-coated. This is a thought-provoking, helpful, informative and encouraging book. I believe most people would gain some information from this book to improve their marriage.
This book has no structure.: Milton Newman Bunker analyses celebrities handwritings.You can't learn how to do it yourself this way because graphology analysis needs to be structured and have a plan to scan every aspect of a handwriting.I don't agree with the other reviewers: this is not a good book and I am going to resell it quickly.Hope this help
Great Word Book: This is one book that the Word user should have in their library. I especially like the fact that it is the only book I have found that addresses the subject of field codes in some depth. It is a good source and the explanations are detailed enough for any user to follow. You won't be disappointed buying this book for sure!
Didn't recieve: I ordered this book in November of 2009 and it is now February 2010 and I have not received the book, please look into it for me, thank you Ellen
Excel, one of the most useful spreadsheet products available.: I always enjoy learning how to do data studies and Excel is the best for doing so. People at work are amazed that Excel can do so much and this book can teach you the nifty tricks.
Good, but not perfect: The primary reason I bought this scope was to do photography, and it's nice for that. I've used it to take pictures, and they come out nicely, but the scope is -big- and I'm having trouble finding an appropriate carrying case for it, which is a bit of a pain. I'd have gladly paid more for the scope had it come with a custom case.That said, it's lighter than you'd expect, and I had to buy macro ring extenders to be able to take photos closer than 40' or so (the description when I purchased it said 15' minimum focal length. If all you're looking for is a scope, this is very nice for the price (but useless without a very solid tripod). If you're looking for photography adaptation, it's a little complicated and will definitely require those macro adapters. This makes for complicated field work, figuring out which macro adapters (if any) to use, depending on the distance of the object.That said, I -am- very happy with this scope.
A Strong Start with a Very Weak Finish: Mr. Ingram started the book out quite strongly with a fundamentally different way to look at relationships than has been done through popular culture and the media for the last 70+ years. However, about halfway through the book, Mr. Ingram steps up to the pulpit and is sidetracked by a excessively-long rant on sexual purity and the "Second Sexual Revolution". Only a scant few paragraphs are dedicated to addressing that which the author proposed in the front half of the book. In short, Mr. Ingram builds a nice head of steam but vents it off too soon. In fact, it almost seems as if halfway through, the author forgot about the book he started to write and starts writing another one.
I don't know what I was thinking....: I gave it a shot...I really did...and once again I was disappointed...Perhaps it works for some and the book was intended for those people, but for those of us who don't have the energy to keep breaking our hearts over and over again by "hoping" it just won't work.
The new sexual revolution begins with YOU! a must read!!: This book has changed my life and the lives of many around me. I didn't realize how caught up in the Hollywood ideal of "the american dream" I was. Chip details God's plan for all in regard to sexuality and leading a God-centered life. The way I date has now changed and I have begun the cause for the new Sexual Revolution. I did not realize how much my past dictated my future and those around me. A must read for all people! It will change our society as we know it. Abstinence is a must! Buy many copies and pass them on!
A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE !!!: This book is probably the second most important book for everyone who is considering getting into a relationship , or is in one , next to the Bible itself . If the reader takes this prescription to heart and applys it to his or her own life , they will be on thier way to a very , very blessed life !!! Thank you Chip Ingram for such a wonderful blessing to the world !!!
new perspective: This book has changed my perspective on relationships, with potential mates and with God. I believe anyone could read this and see themselves, and know where they may have made mistakes in the past with relationships, and gain new hope. This is a must read for anyone seeking answers about God's way to approach love and relationships.
Love, Sex and Lasting Relationships: Wish I had read this book many years ago. I am reading it a second time because it is so enlightening. A must read for single and married people.
Awesome: This book was truly amazing. It gave me wisdom and edcuated me on alot of things! I would recomend this book to any and everyone!!! JESUS!!
Love this book!: This book explained why my relationships kept failing. Finally an answer!I have given this book to my niece and nephew.
I wish every young teen would read this book: This book gave me insights into why my relationships were always a disaster, even if I had to wait years to realize it. I wish this had been a must read for me when I was a teen.
Get to the point: I love to read The book probably has great information but I've tried to read it twice. I made it to chaper 3 this time. It drones on and on and on. Get to the point and then move to the next one. Maybe I should start half way through or read one paragraph a page.
Weird: Nothing else to say about this one other than it was really too weird for me. I didn't finish it - and likely won't open it again.
Nothing of note except maybe bird soup: This is not Nobel Prize winning material. Not even close. Not sure if I will another by him. I would recommend anything by Mario Llosa over this.
Lost in translation?: Maybe it's a better book read in Chinese. Could not get in to it at all so didn't finish it.
Way to graphic and too much on alcohol, disgusting foods.: I probably just chose the wrong book. One of the very few I did not finish. Just could not relate to the subject matter. Maybe I will try a different one in about 10 years!
Good read!: 2012 Literature Nobel Prize Winner, Mo Yan, stated somewhere that he was influenced by Gabriel Garca-Marquez, winner thirty years ago. Though I was curious about how his works brought about the latter's characteristics once translated into English or Spanish.I must admit that the some of the metaphorical similarity between both authors' works seems to be there, as well as creating fantasy to expose social irregularities.Mo Yan combines wine and literature to create very original metaphors, which are described while going into first, second and third person quite craftily.The e-book version does have quite a few edition flaws, especially towards the ending chapter, where all punctuation is lacking. If this was intended I must admit that a Nobel Prize Literature has earned the right to re-invent punctuation, even though it made reading a bit strenuous.
Mesmerized Hours: Reading The Republic of Wine reminds me of hours spent in reverie...one is engaged in the moment, able to recall bits and pieces of what may or may not have occurred, recognizing that one was absorbed but not quite sure why, and ultimately delighted to have had the experience/ I keep asking myself when I will reread the novel to gain a clearer perspective but anticipate that it will be years before I do so/ The repetition of the images reinforce the visual power of Mo Yan's words and help the imagination to conceive yet another cinematic moment...although it might be more suited to film noire/
Excellent camera: I have had the c-5060 for almost a year and am very happy with the camera. The wide-angle lens is great for landscape photos. I find that the amount of post-processing I need to do with photos from this camera is minimal. Sharpness is always good right off the camera. It also handles contrasty scenes very well and doesn't overexpose as much as other cameras I have owned.
it seemed great at first: I bought this camera for work. It was terrific for four weeks and then the mode dial stopped working. I returned it to the distributor. Two weeks later, I collected it from the distributor. It worked fine for a week. Then the mode dial stopped working again as did the arrow pad. I am now returning it for a second time.
Great Camera, But....: ...you're on your own when it comes to batteries. If you're wealthy and can afford pocketfuls of weird batteries, you'll love this camera. I was going to buy it until I learned it doesn't take 4 AAs. I can get AAs in Calcutta, Urbicande, Samaris and Detroit. Try getting a A78XX324732799-U rechargable! (Actually, they may have one in Samaris, but I wouldn't count on it.)Avoid proprietary batteries as you would avoid, well, proprietary batteries. Ten years from now they'll be special order only and will cost more than the camera does today.Happy Shooting! Whatever you buy.
I'm staying away...: I don't own this camera, so in fact this isn't a review. I'm just getting my voice on the record so Olympus can know my major concerns,and why I WON'T be upgrading from my C-5050 despite the major improvement in camera startup and response time.1. Get rid of the proprietary battery. Reap your profits in repeat busines, not in milking each customer for all their worth.2. Give us the fast 1.8 lens found on the C-5050. This one's a no-brainer.3. Get the build quality right. I've seen too many reviews here and elsewhere warning of multiple returns for defective cameras.4. Make extension lens attachments standard. You don't have to include the lens, fine, but don't make me buy an extra part when you can build it in for practically nothing.'Nuff said!
Decent camera when it works: For the first year we owned this camera, it worked pretty well. You can read online camera reviews for the specifications.But then it started to malfunction badly. It would lock up, refuse to go into certain modes, display random menu settings on the screen, etc. These problems seems to occur to many 5060 cameras after several months of use.In a word, it is unreliable. You're probably better off looking for a more reliable camera.
Manufacturer's defect & horrible service should deter you from buying Olympus: Hello. While this camera was nice for the first couple of months I had it, its got a well-documented manufacturer's defect that Olympus has yet to accept. I had to send it back TWICE for repair and, despite the fact that it was returned to me still broken, they now want me to pay them $244.65 to fix it. What? Is this a joke?I created a website in honour of Olympus' behavior - OLYMPUSCHEATEDME*COM. You should check it out for the full story. If you have a similar story, please let me know.
DO NOT BUY OLYMPUS C-5060 DIGITAL CAMERA!: Olympus has a problem w/ part# VC7997 on these cameras that causes menus to pop up on LCD w/o touching buttons and buttons stop working. Numerous people are complaining about this problem on the Internet - go to yahoo groups, Olympus_405080. Olympus needs to recall camera. Mine worked fine for almost 3 months before problem arose so don't think yours won't fail.
My first camera was an Olympus OM-1 SLR - Still works unlike my 5060: I loved my 5060 until the menu system failed the second time. Just a year after repair and three years of ownership. Dissapointing reliability performance. I don't yet understand how long a digital camera should last. My expectation is 5 years without issues for cameras above $300. That may be unrealistic. I don't love Olympus anymore and poor servcie from a long standing company can not be tolerated by consumers. I will not buy another Olympus until they have proven to be loyal to me and you.
Quality Problems with my c-5060: I have had a 5060 for about 2 years. Paid $700 for it new, now selling for around $400. I started having problems with not being able to access any of the menu functions. Started researching the problems on the forums and find that it is a common problem with this camera. Sent it in to Olympus for repair. Their charges are to be $180. An e-mail to them begging for consideration was never answered. I do not advise anyone to buy this camera...
Poor quality: A camera as expensive as this one should work for more than a couple of years. I used to love the camera and Olympus but will not buy there products ever again. The menu options have malfunctioned making the camera usless. And after reading the most current reviews the same problem has happened to many other people. Seeing that so many people have had this same problem shows that Olympus makes poor quality equipment even in there more expensive cameras. Look elsewhere.
Good chance you'll have problems with this camera: I love the camera and it's features--but both of the ones I've received have failed within about 100 pix over 2-4 days.First one had a bad on/off switch. Camera ON IT"S OWN would start scrolling through menus. And guess what--I didn't even realize there were other features in menus I never even got to see. I wouldn't have figured that out if I didn't get #2.The second camera's on/off switch was fine, so I thought OK, now I've got a keeper. On the third day of taking some pix, suddenly the LCD doesn't work--meaning you can't see any menus either.Olympus has a big problem with this camera. I'll order one more--maybe third time is a charm. But if the third one is a bum, I'll have to wait until Olympus figures out the problems. Hopefully another camera maker will come out with a wide angle lens, which was my main criteria for picking this camera.
Sweet little book: Unfortunately this book is out of print. It is an excellent book for a course or self study for the chemistry major or other student who wishes to prepare for qm in the dreaded P-Chem course. Studying it may precede thermodynamics.
My Daughter Loves Her Lightning McQueen Shoes!: We bought these shoes for my 3yo daughter in August. She wears them every day and they still look great. (But I have to admit that she's not really hard on her shoes. She usually outgrows them before she outwears them.) Here are just some of the reasons why I'll probably have to buy her a new pair when she outgrows her current pair:-Everyone comments on how cute they are with the tires, chassis, and flashing lights.-They're easy for her to put on and take off by herself.-No one has noticed or commented that my daughter is wearing a "boy's" shoe.-The dark color helps to hide dirt and scuff marks.These are great shoes for any Cars fan...whether you have a boy or a girl. I only wish they came in grown up sizes!
Excelentessssssssssssssssss.: Mi hijo de 2 aos es loco con estos tenis, cada vez que se viste no importa la ropa que tenga, estos tenis es lo que se quiere poner. Y son muy bonitos a mi me gustaron mucho. Estoy muy contenta con el producto.
The cutest!: I purchased a pair of the Disney Cars Toddler Boys Lightening Strap Sneakers for my grandson's 4th birthday. He loves them! They appear to be well made and have details of Lightening Mc Queen from the movie, Cars.
A Happy Kid!: We just received these shoes for our almost 4 year old. He LOVES them. The soles are nice and the single velcro strip is quick and easy. Difficult to tell from the photo, but McQueen has a little toothy grin at the toe. He is convinced he is now fast as lightning! It was nice to find a Cars shoe in a color other than black.
a favorite: A great birthday gift for kids 3-10! I got it for my little girl, and then bought one for her friend - universally loved by all kids that play with it. Nice to see a gift that does not light up or ding or flash. Simple and fun.
Too long.: The ribbon wasn't lightweight so you really need to move your hand/arm vigorously to make it stay afloat. The long length also contributes to tangling. It's too difficult for a young child.
Passion & Betrayal: The story of a woman who faces an ugly truth - her husband's betrayal, as her happy marriage is eroded. There's temptation, passionate romance, and betrayal wrapped up in an engrossing story of an extended family and how people respond to changes in their lives, including destruction of their expectations.A quick, easy read, and an interesting story. As always with Plain, it's well written, with good character depth as she pulls you quickly in, and you come to really care what will happen to the individuals involved.Belva Plain's books are always great drama, hard to put down, and make good summer reading; this is a good selection to take to the beach. If you like Danielle Steele, you'll enjoy this novel.
superb - and real: This is about real life, whatever some others reviewers say. All teenage boys should read this - this is what happens ultimately if one ignores timeless wisdom and falls victim to trendy, "situation morality". I wish I had read this when I was younger, it might have helped me get my morality straighter earlier in my life.
Simply heartwrenching: This book takes a look at the destruction of a marriage like no book I have ever read before. I cried right along with Margaret, hating the Other Woman to no end. While at times the language is outmoded, this book is still a very powerful depiction of some very painful subject matter. Get out the Kleenex!
Adulterous.: This book is definitely a must read, I have read it twice and still couldn't put it down the second time! Promises delves into the passion and heartbreak that comes with adultery. Margaret is your classic mother figure, sweet, sensitive and loveable from the start. Adam, on the other hand, surprises you... he has an affair with Randi before his marriage to Margaret but ends up breaking it off then he spots her years later in NYC and all his feelings about her come back. You can actually feel the magnetism between Randi and Adam, I sometimes found myself even thinking, "stupid, don't go meet her you have a wife!" The twists and turns in this book get you hooked and the ending?!? It's shocking. Like I said, definitely a must read.
Old hat in more ways than one...: For some reason, I'm drawn to Belva Plain's books. Probably for the beautiful illustrations on the covers of her books, and also for the plain, simply drawn characters. Unfortunately, I find the language to be outdated and not colloquial enough. You don't hear the verb "shall" too often. Also, the characters of all her books are pretty much the same. They have a crisis, they get through it, everyone meets a new mate immediately with whom they fall madly in love. I don't buy it, and believe me, I don't. I'll borrow it from the library first
Out of touch with reality: I don't understand how the author could think it could be believable that these three "perfect" children could be the product of such selfish, self-centered parents. Neither Margaret, nor Adam ever consider their children when they make decisions. Yet supposedly, while they were married, they were wonderful parents. I work with people every day who have gone through greater loss than either of these two parents and still have thought of their children before themselves. It is a fantasy to believe that these parents were ever good parents. In addition, I think it is a lazy author who instead of dealing with emotion simply gets rid of someone. It isn't worth reading because it goes from bad to worse.
Trite, obvious, overdone potboiler: I recently listened to the cassette abridgement, and hadn't listened to much before I was saying to myself "Wow, this is a bad book." The story is incredibly obvious (I could have predicted most of it after the first few minutes), the dialogue is completely unbelievable (I didn't for a minute think that people actually talked like that), the structure was clumsy, and people seemed to exist only to make a point (e.g. the niece). I didn't much like any of the characters, or believe in them for that matter. I don't know if it's the fault of the abridgement or if the novel is like that, but I think I'll skip her books from now on.
Broken promises: Margaret and Adam Crane have loved one another since high school. They marry when they both have finished college. However, Adam is hiding a secret from his college days and soon the secret will disrupt the 17 year marriage of the couple.This story is a sad look at how divorce and infidelty can ruin everyone's life; the family and the children that are left behind. The other woman who can disrupt a marriage is also depicted through two different threads in the story.Belva Plain captures the essence of a marriage in decline and the chaos that is created when infidelity breaks apart a loving family. This is a great read that kept me reading until late at night.
Israel Inside: It was good, it provides the precursors to what leads to achievement and accomplishment. Rather than focusing on how to avoid problems, it explains how to make things better.
Beware! Product is not what advertised.: The cables I received are not gold plated and do not have ferrite cores as stated on the website. I complained to the company and they insist I received the correct cables. I sent a copy of their ad twice that shows the product features. It is obvious this company knows nothing about customer service and I will never shop with this company again.
DO NOT BUY!!!: I purchases 2 of these cords to hook up one monitor to 2 machines by way of a switch box. Completely USELESS unless you are using an old 800*600 resolution monitor. My crisp clear 1440*900 monitor reverted to a blurry 800*600 resolution and I could not even manually adjust the resolution to the correct spec. It kept reverting to big ugly mode that I had not seen since early 1980s. To verify it was not a problem with the switch box i hooked up up the cable directly still no good. The shipping cost more than the product I will just trash it and try again. Save your time and shipping. You have been warned...I should have heed the 0 reviews.
Works just fine: The cable worked just fine; I purchased it so that I could toggle between a 15" computer monitor and a 40" flat screen TV. The product arrived timely and did exactly what I needed it to do.
Different from picture and does not work: On the picture AND in product description it has a FERRITE Cores. The actual product DOES NOT.I would not have noticed it if the cable actually worked!It does not work! Will return it when a good cable arrives.What a waste of time!!
Came up short.: For some reason, the red component of the signal failed to show up on the monitor when I installed this cord; I must have gotten a defective one. It's also too much of a hassle to bother returning this defective product, shipping & handling costs being what they are. Caveat emptor!
SVGA male to male 3ft.: This item was very good for connecting a VGA switch box to my computer. It was well made and performed well when switching between computer monitors and TV.
Great for a laptop to view on a TV!: I bought this because I have a netbook and I watch much TV and movies online but after a while it strains my eyes, and I am 24 with normally good eyesight. Anyway, this plugged straight into my netbook and to my LCD TV and the picture was perfect. Even at the great price quality is not sacrificed.
defective?: This cord seemed to be working but I noticed that my pc was not recognizing the monitor, and was showing up as a generic that had a lower resolution than was possible. I thought it was the switch I bought at the same time so I could connect my TV to my pc as well as my monitor. I happened to have another monitor cord, connected it and then the pc "saw" my monitor and I was able to set the resolution to max. Since this cord was used to connect from pc to switch, it affected monitor and TV resolution quality. I am guessing a defective conductor or connection. Not worth the hassle to return, so I'm out five bucks.
Excellent Cable: This 3 foot cable works perfectly between our Samsung NC-10 and the Hitachi LED TV. Though somewhat thick, its length is ideal for our installation, and is easily integrated into the bundle of audio and video cables feeding the TV. This cable replaced a similar 6 foot cable. Note the filtering at both ends. I presume that all pins are used, as detection by each piece of equipment is automatic. I highly recommend this cable for this sort of application, especially with the low price. The overall quality is excellent.
Hear and Soul: Johnny music videio is outstanding. He is a great singer and entertainer. His musice does appeal to a wide audience.
Johnny Reid Live: Heart and Soul: This DVD is incredible!!! It is one you can listen to over and over again and never tire......Buy it !!!
Nice Frame - Not so durable: I bought this frame because I had 2 black labs at the time. The frame is really nice but the frisbee in the dogs mouth was not attached when i recieved it. Not a big deal, because we were able to glue it back but for what I paid, I thought it would be better packaged. It would be 5 stars otherwise.
Small: If your Motorcycle has ferrings, get a larger size. I have yet to return the too small one, looks like good quality for a couple of years. Our main goal: protection in rain and sun, and wind --blowing off in the rain is not so good ... cannot check how bottom latches work yet.--Californian
My 8th graders loved these.: I used this for the last days of school...my students kept wanting me to do more of these with them. I only started out doing a few that day but they begged me to continue. It was so much fun seeing the smiles on their faces.
I LOVE THIS BOOK!: This book is full of so many riddles (both easy and challenging) that really make you think. The answers are at the back of the book, so you don't go crazy trying to answer a riddle. The answers are so obvious, it makes you want to laugh for not thinking about it before. Great buy! Great for road trips, plane trips, or just any spare moment!
shallow: I bought this dvd because of some of the reviews and I was sorry. The acting, especially the actress', was shallow and unbelievable. How did they fall so deeply in love from just a few conversations? Anyway, my wife chastised me for crying at the end (maybe I was crying over the waste of money?). Now how am I going to get rid of it. The actress made it sound like she would be able to WALK again, so what's the big detail, more time in rehab? I thought that Matrix had a more star-crossed relationship between Trinity and Neo.
Love affair Irene Dunn: Disappointing original to a much more sensitive portrayal by Deborah Kerr & Cary Grant. A wooden performance by Irene Dunn, who looks haggard in places doesn't help.
This is the best of the three filmed versions: "An Affair to Remember" makes me sick with it's overt sentimentality, but "Love Affair" doesn't. Why? Because Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne keep it from becoming too maudlin. Plus for some reason, it seems simpler and more forthright than the later versions. Probably because it was made before WWII. Whatever the reason, this version is much more satisfying.
A sweet, romantic tear jerker: Get the box of tissues......this movie is one of the most romantic of them all. The original of An Affair to Remember, you will love it just as much....or maybe even more.
Emotionally Involved: Item # B0000A0DTV Love Affair, DVD (Irene Dunn and Charles Boyer)This DVD makes up for the previous release I ordered that wouldn't play. I really wanted this video for the sake of a song included "Go On And Dance My Heart This Is Romance My Heart".I could have the title mistaken, but the big-band melody is sweet. Mom said she thinks Irene Dunn wasn't the actual vocal track, but a lip-synch. So I really don't even know who is singing this song. However, this old movie is charming to watch.Without giving away the plot, I'll volunteer that the crisis in this movie is such a tear-jerker it even had me a little misty-eyed before it was over. It's interesting to contemplate what a sorry world it really would be if we all abandoned our choice to believe in each other. Potentially tragic indeed.
Awful version: Awful! Out of the three versions..... "An Affair To Remember" Grant/Kerr is THE ONLY ONE. Dunne is much too gay all the time (the role is best played when Terry is apprehensive and decision torn). Boyer is diminutive (particularly his head) next to her. The most important nuance of the entire film is completely blown when Michel/Boyer speaks in such a way as not to admit that he was waiting for Terry/Dunne (Empire State Building)and her reaction instead of poignant (as Kerr's) was sought of an odd knowing smile when it should have been the look of a question mark... as Michel had not as yet disclosed that he was actually there. Obviously,the director corrected this reaction and Terry/Dunne's annoying never ending gayety in "Affair to Remember."
Bad Quality DVD!: I have to agree that these are bad prints. I bought 5 of these Madacy DVDs and will return all of them. I am not usually very picky about quality. A good VHS tape is just wonderful to me. These DO NOT COME CLOSE TO VHS!The sound quality is so bad, I couldn't get through the film. The hiss is not only audible, it drowns out the soundtrack. The picture has weird artifacts that I have never seen before. I could have tolerated them, but the audio hiss gave me a headache. My guess is that the publisher bought a $2.99 VHS tape of these movies and transferred the tape to DVD. No noise reduction whatsoever. Its like listening to a cheap cassette on a $5.00 walkman--I kid you not! You could do just as good a job in your basement with a VHS tape player and a DVD writer. Come on Madacy, you could have at least suppressed that hiss!
Great movie, poor digital quality: This is a great movie but I couldnt get past how poor the digital quality was. Well you get what you pay for.
A Horrible DVD of a Great MMovie: This is an abominably engineered DVD of a great movie. It isn't worth one cent of its bargain-basement price. Don't buy it -- get this title on VHS instead. Overall, both picture and sound are worse than the VHS version. It appears to have been produced by simply copying a tape version onto a disc. The picture is frequently blurred, and the soundtrack contains what appear to be fragments of conversations and music in the studio where it was recorded. The soundtrack also is done in a "pseudo-surround" format, consisting of distributing the entire track (voices and music) equally over all five speakers. The dialogue is also frequently hard to make out. I would be doubtful about any DVD from this distributor, MADACY entertainment.
Poetic and absolutely loverly: I'm not one to write lengthy reviews. So here's mine. Buy it. It's worth it.Once I finished the book and put it back on the table.. my heart skipped a beat.
Courtney Crumrin and the Coven of Mystics: A brother in law recommended this book. What he didn't tell us was it was a comic book, not a novel. The art is bad and the story is even worse. Based on his opinion, we bought one and, frankly, threw it in the garbage.
More wonderful tales.: Ted Naifeh has done it again, proving he is one of the most amazing voices working in comics today. The tales here are a bit darker than his previous Courtney Crumrin series, but character has grown a bit since first discovering the world of magick, so it works well. Beautiful art, a compelling storyline, and a heroine who anyone who's ever felt alone can relate to. Wonderful work, Ted!
My favorite little smartmouthed brat returns!: Ted Naifeh, Courtney Crumrin and the Coven of Mystics (Oni, 2003)Courtney Crumrin's back and better than ever. In her second miniseries, we find that in the small town of Hillsborough, Courtney and her uncle Aloysius are far from the only two magicians in residence. In fact, there's an entire coven of mystics. (You may have guessed that from the title.) One of them is intent on mischief, and it falls to Courtney to uncover the villain. Doing that involves all sorts of experiences she's never had before--such as doing her own homework. Absolutely wonderful, this. Courtney is a fine creation. If you're not familiar with her yet, you should be. ****
Muy bien por Charlie Cruz: Saludos desde Mxico!!!. Compr este Cd por la cancin "dos cosas" de Charlie Cruz, ya que no la encontr en ningn otro CD, y la verdad que el resto de sus canciones tambin son buenas (aunque la cancin dame un chance viene en otros CDs): primer amor, pasin escolar, etc. Respecto a Ley Alejandro puedo comentar que sus canciones me aburrieron: maneja una estructura bastante repetitiva y con mal ritmo para mi gusto. Si solo le di 4 cruces fue por esto ultimo. Muy bien por Charlie Cruz!!!
Reivew of Chorinicles of Narnia The Lion, etc.: I liked the game for the few minutes I could play it. i got a bad copy and although I got a refunded I never bought the game again so that soured my experience.
CRAPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!: I don't see what the other reviewers see in this game. The graphics are o.k., but it's crap! I played a level where Peter helps free Edmund from the White Witch, and stabbing the Cyclops' and Minotaurs doesn't hurt them, but picking Edmund up by the neck and swinging him around like a club OBVIOUSLY hurts them! CRAP! And also, the characters mouths don't move when they talk! Either they're very good ventriloquists, or the creators of this game were too lazy! I would only recommend die-hard Narnia fans rent it, and see if it's any good. And trust me, this game isn't scary! ( I mean, (...) but only 7,8,or 9 year olds could be scared by this, this,this, CRAP!)
Make-believe Anarchism for revolutionary wannabees: All the information in this book is either bogus or suitable only for puerile kiddie games for the weird types who like to sit around and play like make-believe revolutionaries. None of the instructions are adequate to make the infernal devices described (blasting caps, pipe bombs, grenade launchers, Claymore mines, rocket launchers) and most require access to conventional explosives (from unspecified sources). There are no discussions about how to prepare actual explosive mixtures (any 19th century handbook or innumerable Websites will give much, much more reliable information), and the one explosives recipe (for "plastic explosives") is a joke and would not work (although grinding potassium chlorate crystals into a fine powder as recommended could cause autodetonation and serious injury to the would-be bomb-maker.....).This short (64 pp) book is poorly printed and full of typos. I deeply regret having wasted my (money) on it.
U got to be kiddin: books like this are not a relaible source if you want to make explosives because they would probaly blow up in your face.If you want good books, try Poor man's James bond, princples of improvised explosive device (Switches) and Home workshop explosives (on Amazon) because you can make the stuff, if you wanted to but.Also don't get caught with books because of September 11Do not show them off to your friends or family
error?: I believe there is a bit of problem in this biography. It gives Gene Fowler (1931- ) credit for the book GOODNIGHT, SWEET PRINCE, a bio of John Barrymore. But, that book was first published in 1943, meaning that this Fowler would have been 12 at the time.I believe that the writer has confused Fowler the poet with Gene Fowler the newspaper columnist -- who lived from 1890 to 1960.
Changing with the modern sound of today, great job: I am muscian/producer I own eight CDs by Djavan (my wife is Brazilian) so I ve had the opportunity to listen to him muitos vezs over the last 15 years. I like his ablity to modernize his sound but still write very strong hook lines (melody) Great production (Mix) very pleaseing to the ear.
Nowhere near the versitile tool it's advertised to be: Very disappointed in this opener. The bottle opener doesn't fit anything I've tried to use it on so far; the pull tab opener doesn't easily slide under the tab without a lot of work. The person I purchased this for has limited hand strength and I thought this would be perfect; it is far from it. You'd do as well using a spoon to open pull tabs rather than purchase this pricey gadget.
Fails to open most plastic lid bottles: This unit looks nice, the pop top works of course but try to open a deer park bottle or other similar and it slips on the plastic top.Bought for someone with arthritis, do not purchase for it will not work even out of the box after a couple times.
Junk: Doesn't work or anything. Opening water bottles is a joke! You have to press it down so hard on the bottle top that the water squirts all over the place. The soda can opener part is too thick to get under the pop top. Don't waste your money.
not for the weak of hand: Have great difficulty and weakness in my hands. Need too much strength to accomplish the tasks I wanted this for.Very disappointing.
! SUPERB !: BIG DEAL. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST VALUE PURCHASES I HAVE MADE. THIS BOOK IS THE BIBLE FOR THE IRON WORKERS AND ONLY FOR 4.99. INCREDIBLE.
Almost Great: I first must stress that I am already pretty tired of Call of Duty type (WWII FPS) games. I prefer 3rd Person SOCOM type games but this one is different because of the Wii controls. You've never been able to feel more in the game than you can now. The non-stop action will never get you bored especially because you have to stay focused with the Wii Remote. If you have checked my review of this game for PS3 and are wondering why they are so different, let me quickly explain. I rented it and returned it within a couple days because it bored the hell out of me. The main question is... would you rather feel (Wii Gameplay & Controls) like you're in the real WAR environment, or would you rather it look (PS3 & Xbox Graphics) like you're in the real WAR environment. For this reason, as in for other games like Madden, DBZ, etc... is why I choose Wii.
Lots of action: This game keeps moving. It's easy to get lost in the action and lose track of time. You don't get killed at every corner you turn so it's not frustrating in that respect. Controls take a while to get used to. Couple of cons, occasionally waste time trying to figure out how to get out of a blown up house, 2nd the mounted machine gun is non-intuitive. When you lift UP on the butt end the gun nozzle (front) should point down. It's backwards in the game, you basically have to ignore the gun and concentrate on the cursor. It's a little weird having the Sarge tell you to lead the charge when you haven't got any ammo left. Large selection of weapons to shoot from single shot scoped rifles to machine guns, occassional hand to hand, binoculars, calling in tank rounds, etc. Overall lots of fun, I may even let my son play it sometime :)
#1 Best Game on the Wii Launch (Except Zelda): Call of Duty is the best game that you can get for the Wii with its launch titles. Except for Zelda TP, of course. The story line is incredibly well developed as you lead the ally forces in their liberation of France. The game utilizes all aspects of the systems capabilities as you use the unique motion sensing capabilities to drive a jeep, plant charges, aim a mortor, and even fire your own weapon. The graphics are not quite comparable to those of the PS3's or the 360's, but it never becomes an issure. This game is incredibly fun and I would strongly reccomend it anyone.
Fun singleplayer, NO multiplayer: This game is actually a lot better then I thought it would be. However, be warned that there is NO multiplayer whatsoever, off or online. I keep seeing companies advertise it as having multiplayer but it really doens't. It would be nice if the game actually did include it, but the developer said it will not be added in the future. I wish companies would stop saying it includes it when it doesn't, because it's false advertisement and I bought it under false pretense because of such.
Unfortunate Sequel: I would blame this game sucking on the Wii, it is unfortunate that the sequel to COD2 had to be this game. I played it on the X-Box 360 and it wasn't good there either. I was only able to stand playing the game for about an hour. After that I couldn't bring myself to touch it again.
Terrible Play Control: This game is horrible, if you have XBox360, purchase it for that system, as you will find the Wii controls way too cumbersome. The slightest shift of your hand results in the view on screen changing completely. Don't buy this game.
Great for starters: Bought this for my husband for Christmas so that he could get on the wii and play some games....kept him very busy! LOLOL
Great Fun Game for Boys. Some violence.: My 11 year old son loves all Call of Duty products, and I was a little worried about this game. However, it actually has him using the remotes to do hand to hand combat, where he gets off the couch and gets active. It provides some pretend driving fun, tanks, jeeps etc. It's not only fun, but it also has built some confidence in him in a more defensive capacity. Aside from the more mature violent content, I really was surprised by the fun of the game.
Wii controls make shooter game more natural: Call of Duty 3 is a fun game. I myself have never been good a first person shooter games and was doubtful on whether I would like this game. However, the ability to aim with the remote made it seem much more natural and fun for me. I was able to start feeling like a pro after the first couple missions.The game has some rough spots. Its frustrating to use the reomote motions to do things such as plant explosices as the game doesn't seem to pick up the motions very well, in those situations. I found myself frustrated having to repeat motions alot. The game is also shorter than I expected as I had just finished Zelda and was expecting more gameplay but the couple weeks of fun I got out of it (one mission or so a day) was worth it over all.
Awesome game!: This game is awesome! I bought this game at Game Stop. I recommend this to anyone who can't play the newer version of Call of Duty because of the rating. -Stephen, age 9
The Call of Duty 3: My grandson loves it and plays it all the time on his Wii. I just hope it's not too violent for him.
Did not work: Do not buy from this company (Activision/EZ corp). I purchase this game for my son for Christmas and it did not work. They contacted me with a nice email apologizing and promising to refund my money and sen me a new game. They have done neither.
Unplayable - can't get past first hand-to-hand: I'm amazed anyone else here could write a review at all for this game on the Wii. No one at my house has been able to get past the first hand-to-hand combat with the German soldier. We tried dozens of times, different strategies, different controllers - nada. The game even prompts you with instructions during the melee, but nothing seems to work - fast, slow or otherwise.
Great FPS: Having just upgraded from the XBOX 1 to Wii, I was greatly impressed with this game. I read some reviews that panned the graphics etc and I must say its really a perspective thing. If you're coming from the XBOX 1 you won't be disappointed at all. The controller gun is great. I am using the NERF gun,,, **Gamestop is selling Call of Duty 3 for 19.99..
Not worthy of the title "Call of Duty": This game is nothing like the Call of Duty series that I'm a big fan of on the PC (created by a different game design studio). There is no multiplayer mode so all you have is the single player campaign which has nothing even close to the depth of Call of Duty for the PC. On top of that the graphics are poor. I found it hard to tell the difference between a brick wall and an enemy soldier. Maybe I'm spoiled from the excellent graphics of my desktop PC but if you want to play Call of Duty on a budget, do yourself a favor and grab a $40.00 AGP (Radeon 9250 or Geforce FX) 128MB video card and the original Call of Duty PC game. I promise it will be way more fun (with better graphics and exciting multiplayer game play) for around the price of this Call of Duty 3 Wii game alone. For FPS games stick to the PC but for something fun and well suited to the Wii try Rayman Raving Rabbids - it's fun and really shows off what the Wii is all about.
Worst game for Wii: I bought this game, thinking that it would be fun(regardless of the multiplayer, which, by the way is unacceptable). The truth is, the "coolness" factor wears off extremely fast, and then it just collects dust. Out of all the Wii games I've played, this is, by far, the worst.
disappointed: While playing the game there were some problems with remote and game. Didn't always connect making it hard to play.
I can't give less than one star?: Little did I know, but it turns out that a number of women I know have read and promoted this book for many years - and now they (most notably my own mother) sit and wonder why their husbands don't respect them or even give them the time of day and, for some, their marriages are falling apart by the seams.This book promotes the dumbing-down of women and their roles in society and family. For centuries women have worked alongside men (granted, getting less credit, but working just the same) and only the privileged few could stand idly by while the 'menfolk' talked 'business'. Even my own grandmother worked a full-time job (from which she just retired at the age of 74!), managed to successfully raise three great children and is still happily married after 50+ years.
Highly recommend: These are an excellent product. You can get less expensive ones, but I don't recommend it. These wear like the day I bought them wash after wash and very comfortable. One of the better running socks. Highly recommended.
Nice surprise: Bought them in time for my sister to try them out before her marathon in a few weeks. She says its like walking on clouds and is excited to make adjustments to improve her running experience.
Not for a Man's Size Foot: I have worn Thorlo Running Rolltop Socks for at least 20 years with no problem. I am extremely disappointed in this last purchase in that the elastic at the top is very tight. The opening itself is small and evidently made for a little girl's foot.
ring: although the ring is very intrical the sizing is smaller than it claims to be--maybe due to the artwork/design. i suggest you could wear this on the midsection of your finger <as opposed to the traditional third section of your finger or closest to your palm>
It Will Keep You In Suspense From Beginning To End: Roarshock is one of these books that will have you wondering what is going to happen next and at times, it's not what you think it is. If you like a good scary story with suspense and well developed characters, read Roarshock today. You won't be sorry you did.Hey Kurt, when is the movie version coming out?
Disappointing: The book is outdated. Does not apply to a wide variety of students. Was absolutely no help to either of my children whatsoever.
Fell apart as soon as opened!: I purchased 3 of this product for a school play. As soon as we pulled 2 of them out of the bag the feathers fell off! We will not be able to use them at all unless we figure out a way to fix them ourselves. I emailed the company and never recieved a response. The children our disappointed and I wasted my money.
Not a toy, so hard to rate properly. They were nice.: They were nice wings. They fit a costume for a nine year old well. They seem like they will last a while, time will tell.
Wings not as represented: We have already sent you a complaint about this product. The item was not as advertized so was of no use to us.
Gobbledy gook: I found nothing of value in here. This guy is from Harvard so I thought there would be some poignant, new, insightful analysis here. Instead I found pop-psychology stuff that is entirely unhelpful and nothing concrete in which the reader can put into practice. Not only that, it doesnt provide any improvement or insight into the investment psychology literature. I read 1/2, couldnt bare the rest.
Head Job: The real value in this book is taking the time to read and reflect on the many skills an investor should have developed. It is not a "fun" read. It is not a book you cannot put down! It should be read over time (like a textbook) and not digested quickly. Some insights may be helpful, like knowing why you hold on to securities that turn out to be losers. It is unlikely to help you decide precisely when to sell but it may free your thinking to know there is a time and you should deal with it. I suggest taking the time to read the book. Expect what you usually get from a book on Psychology.
Insightful, well-organized, and engaging: This book is about the advice that local public officials receive -- when and why is is good and useful, when and why it is more often not useful and not used. The book is an absolute model of its kind. The author, Peter Szanton, knows his subject very well, has organized his conclusions well, and writes with grace. Superb.
The Road To Auschwitz: I really enjoyed this book. Its about a girl named Hedi Fried. Her family was a normal family. But there was one problem. She was a Jew. One day her family was intruded at their house. Every person was ordered to stand outside for hours on their street. They were later taken to a ghetto where they were transported by train to a death camp called Auschwitz. They had to follow strict rules and watch people get taken from their families and put into gas chambers, getting shot and thrown into mass graves. They smelt the smoke and decay of the dead being burned. Hedi's parents were killed along with her many friends. Hedi and her sister Livi were the only ones who survived in her family. Later in life Hedi got married and had children. Livi died a couple of years later along with Hedi's husband.
Works fine: I was looking for something that might protect the lense better, but it works fine. It provides a little cushion for impact when I have dropped and protects it when it is dangling from my climbing harness 1000 ft up on some face.
Disappointed: I bought the GPS attachment to the telescope and was quite disappointed with it. It failed to work properly so I returned it. It did not establish my location, was slow to operate, etc.
Informative book, and useful: I expected more from this book. A lot of the things mentioned I already knew, basically because I had already read the books he was making references to. But it has good advice for life.
A Must Have!!: This was one of the first LP's I ever bought and it is still an essential part of my music collection. They were signed to Atlantic Records right out of the NYC club scene and brought all that energy from playing night after night into the studio for their debut recording which was produced by Arif Mardin and engineered by Tom Dowd. I believe they were the first white group to join the Atlantic roster. Their first big hit "Good Lovin" is here along with classic renditions of "In The Midnight Hour" and "Mustang Sally". The Collector's Choice reissue is the whole album in stereo and mono. A must have for any fan of sixties rock & soul.
Rascals: The Young Rascals was one of the best bands to emerge from the 60's.I love the Hammond organ and Felix's voice.
AWESOME!: I feel the same about this CD as I do the other Rascals CD that I purchased. Timeless for those who have been there!
Beautiful Tableware: I have a complete set for twelve, so the Covered Sugar Bowl and Creamer were a natural selection. Pfaltzgraff's Villa della Luna is a beautiful pattern. I would encourage anyone who would like to have something beautiful and very different to consider this pattern.
get them from the store: i paid over $20 for 12 items that were pre-priced at .99 cents each. and on top of that they are kinda stale. i would have been better off buying another brand from my local store.
Good product if they are not stale!: I've ordered these snacks twice. It was the second time around that I was very disappointed. Over half the bags were stale. I called the seller and they informed me that they did not accept returns. They had no real explanation for the stale product other than it's made weekly. They offered to send me a variety box of some of their other snacks in exchange. I had to follow-up with them 2-wks later when nothing showed. As indicated in title, the pork rinds are great if they are fresh. Be forewarned, there is a 50/50 chance the quality will not be as expected.
They do it again!: Tell me, can these guys make a bad album? So far I've been blown away by every album I've picked up by this band & there seems to be no sign of them slowing down. 'Worlds Apart' is Silent Force's third album, & it continues to show how this band brilliantly takes power metal to another level. OK, so "brilliant" might be a bit of an exaggeration, but in a world full of power metal bands it's nice to be able to identify bands that stand out on their own & not sound completely like all of the other well known bands that are on the scene such as Primal Fear or Metalium, or maybe even the almighty Hammerfall. I still think so far 'Empire of Future' is the best album from Silent Force, but believe me you won't be disappointed with ANY release from this band, & this one is definitely no exception!
Much Better...: Infatuator left me wondering what the hell had happened to DC. I went ahead and "bit" on Worlds Apart and am glad I did. The two albums are completely different. Gone is the monotonous double bass and sound a like songs. This album is one anthem after another. The only drawback is the production. All the sounds run into one another, unlike ARK burn the sun or anything from Sym X. If you are into melodies and driving rythms than get it. Leave infatuator alone.
In step with Karma Collection: If I could, I'd give this 4 1/2; since I can't, I gave a 4. For a large album, it does well. Only a few of the tracks are so-so, and even then, they are tolerable. If you are not familiar with the KC series, think chillout Indian and Middle Eastern style. A lot of sitar, a few songs in Hindi (I think), Arabic, or Farsi, etc... This is the overall feeling of the album. Also throw in a couple of African and Brazilian vibes here and there. I've played it at parties, and while I study or cook. It never disappoints. It's also a great a.m. drive to work album, as the title suggests.If you don't own any KC, get the original KC album first, just because that one is truly five stars!
Great South Asia-inspired club/lounge music: I am so glad to have found this ... for the first CD. In the beginning, there are a couple of good ragas on top of a rhythm section. Other selections are more electronica with the South Asian instruments stuck in for flavor. There are also various Western-style jazz, rock and alternative selections with Middle-Eastern & South Asian samples and melodies. Good variety but it's important to note that it gets less and less South Asian and more California as it goes on. The second CD is mainly California new-agey mood music that would be decent background music, but is otherwise boring.
Not what I wanted: This is primarily a map of central London. I wanted a map showing the whole London area. This map has been designed to be very sturdy and to cover the major London tourist attractions, and it does that. But it plops down a big "tube" map smack on top of the middle of South London so that becomes invisable. I tried to find Portobello Road in Notting Hill, since a number of tourist information sources said that the shopping was good there, but no such road is listed in this map's street index. (I needed a magnifying glass on top of my mild reading glasses to read the index because the print is really, really tiny.) If you have unusually good eyes and want only a map of tourist spots in central London, this may suit you. It did not suit me.
A good buy for those interested in learning about fashion in culture: Excellent well referenced overview of fashion culture. A good, broad introduction to the area. Through the chapter headings you can pick your particular area of interest, or read the whole, as each ties in to the other. Language simple for those new to the area.
Pretty good, not great: Dispenser works pretty well once you get the hang of it. Needs a light touch - no pressure or it will jam. Sometimes it sticks anyway. But competing products aren't any better. Have tried many... Keep coming back to this.
Waste of Money!: I am really disappointed with this product. It doesn't come out of the dispenser very well and the pictures I placed on the page fell off soon after I applied them. Do not waste your money!
cozy warm head covering!: amazing hat! especially covers ears and head! doesn't even leave your hair as if you had a hat on...hat hair!
Good value: This is a book of Turner postcards with perforations -- so that you can send the postcards or keep them as a reference. At around 20 cents each (even less when I bought it) it seems like good value.
disappointment: none of turner's famous works are included in this. also, the color rendition is not so hot. i wish i could return it!
Solid cable: Pro Co S12-25 12 AWG Heavy Duty Cable is worth paying for the price..:PSturdy and thick!Bought it for the church speaker :)
Summertime Blue Eyed Soul: The four lads from NYC outdo themselves on this release. The title cut still stands up 40 years later. The vocals and musicianship provide indication of the sophisticated layered sound the Rascals would produce on future releases. Chuck Rainey provides a low end bass groove that dominates the feel of the tracks, which are lead by the screaming organ and thumping backbeat. Recommended listening to return to an earlier, more innocent time.
I was there: I was in the Dominican Republic at Escuela Caribe from Sept. '82 to Dec. '83. I knew David Scheeres, he lived in my house which was T.K.B. at the time. I don't know about Julia's home life, but I can tell you from first hand experience that she has fabricated a mixture of truth and fantasy in this book concerning the program. We did have boxing matches, but they were strictly between students as a last resort if those students could't get along. In the 16 months that I was in the D.R. I never witnessed a boxing match. I knew alot of the folks that she depicts in her book. My memory is pretty sharp, and I don't recall any of them acting as she says they did in her book. Although I went through the program, and I am posting here, that doesn't mean that I am a "religious fanatic". I want everyone to know that I haven't been to church in over 20 years, because I don't believe in organized religion. Don't be to quick to judge on this one..
If you are convinced that you are 100% correct about religion:: I just finished reading Julia Scheeres' beautifully written memoir. Her story reinforced my belief that parents who believe they are 100% right about any ideology can destroy their children. Every couple who plans to have or adopt a child should read JESUS LAND first.Scheeres' memoir about being raised in a fundamentalist Christian home parallels the struggles of any child raised with absolute values and beliefs. When there is no space for questioning or original thought a child with a good mind is going to suffer. Scheeres had a good mind.
Wonderful Read: Julia is a gifted writer who translates raw emotions and pain into a beautifully writen tale of love between siblings against all odds. I'm eager to see where her career takes her and hope to read more of her writing.
Hearbreakingly funny and vividly rendered memoir: This book was written for the author's adopted black brother David, who stole her heart from the day her white parents brought him home, and the story it tells will steal your heart, too.Jesusland is about Julia and David's steadfast loyalty to and love for each other. Scheeres' writing is simultaneously funny and sad as she narrates the outrageous fortunes she and David suffered growing up in rural Indiana in a mixed race family. Blatant racism, shameful violence, and religious zealotry threatened to wedge them apart but never succeeded.Jesusland is a page-turner, the kind of book you can't put down because you come to care so deeply for the characters and the troubles they're having. I found myself rooting for David and Julia, and even when tragedy strikes, ultimately consoled by the saving grace of their love for each other.
Darkly Comic: GQ was right when it called this memoir darkly comic. I chortled my way through much of it. The whole scene with the clueless preacher trying to dissuade teens from masturbating was priceless. "Jack of with Jesus," anyone? OMG!! I just think about that scene and fight the giggles.(...)Can't wait to see what she writes next....
Required reading for all Americans: This is a beautiful, riveting memoir about a brother and sister battling the odds. I literally could not put it down and found myself paging through it at work and at stoplights in the car. My world view was completely changed in reading it.I consider it required reading for Americans because racism and Christian Evangelicism continue to drag this country down, and Scheeres' experience with both is a one in a million story. Her account reveals the workings of extreme Christian fanaticism, how teenagers are abused and brainwashed. It is a call to look into the serious human rights violations of these "reform schools."Second, it is an amazing story about two siblings, white and black, who are forced to be each others only family; in the end, the power of sibling love transcends everything.
**One Exclent Book**: This book is a collection of historical mysteries. They are fun to read and make you think. The only flaw of this book is that the stories are sometimes based on events you never heard of. Otherwise this is a stupendous book.
Great extras: Apart from the translation of the Ecclesiastical History this book comes also with letters and Canons of Nicaea (no not alternative Biblical canons if theres any conspiracy theorist reading this).This book also commends itself with a fantastic "Introduction" "Annotations" as well as "A Historical View of the Council of Nicea".
A wonderful intro into the mysteries of emacs: The book is well paced and easy to read. The concepts build naturally upon one another. Glickstein provides real world examples to introduce new features. I highly recommend it!
Unable to use it: I ordered this to use with a Celestron C 90 which was in the same order and is nonfunctional so far. As well there were no instructions to explain how to use it.
not impressed: I order this one over the metal one to save five bucks. I figured I didn't need a great one to look at the moon. But; wish I would have paid the few bucks extra. The plastic threads are uneven, and its very difficult to screw in the the eyepiece evenly. It feels like the whole plastic body was deformed from heat.Just pay the extra five bucks and get the metal one.
Rightly Dividing the Word of Truth: This book is essential for those who have a serious interest in studying the Word of God.Basic principles must be understood before proceeding with the detailed study of Biblical doctrine.This book is an excellent source of information for the one who is new to studying or for the one who has been at it many years. A most profitable book for all.I would recommend this book readily.John
Not worth the money: The tools are very poorly made. The heads on the hammers are loose. The avil has a nick on the side. The clamp doesn't close completely. These tools are junk. Not worth even half the purchase price. Unfortunately, I will not be returning them due to the cost of return shipping and not having all the required paperwork. Very disappointed.
Hopeful this will save time.: I haven't used this yet, but I hope it will save time and help with painting straight lines around round objects.
Awesom pump: Great pump, needed to replace our pump after 20 years, and this one looks like it will last another 20. Great pricing and easy shipment.
Expected a new unit, recieved used and abused.: There is a large straight slot screw on the top of the pump that looks like a drain plug. This screw has been tampered with and damaged by overtightening. The rubber seal under the screw head has been ruined as well. There a traces of red silicone sealer on the the damaged seal where someone attempted to kludge it. My guess is the motor is wet inside and will fail due to internal corrosion. Aside from that, it looks like it was a really nice pump before some clown abused it. I will try to get a replacement in new condition.'
Great pump for the money: We recently purchased and new home and immediately learned we needed to replace our pump. We purchased this model and was very pleased with how well it worked. I would recommend this to everyone!
Crap!: Cast iron? The grid on bottem to filter out objects is plastic. Mine came re-packaged, with the cheap plastic grid in pieces. Amazon was prompt on my refund and I went with a better "well known" model that really is cast iron.
A unique and insightful contribution.: Much is written on Nazi Germany, but few works offer much new. This is a very well-written and well-researched account of life for the average (read: not imprisoned) civilian citizen under the Third Reich. Focusing on real-life stories, the author draws insightful conclusions about the limits of Nazi governance in several selected towns. That this is out of print is inexplicable... grab a used copy if one becomes available!
$91 for 1000g of salt?: Go to the grocery store and buy some sea salt. You'll get the same quantity of salt for at leat 20 times less than what they're charging here.
Do not do business with this seller: It has been over 45 days and no product, Will neevr do business with this company again. Have sent multiple emails and had one resonse of well we guess its lost and we will send again.
This book is as useless as the first edition: This author previously wrote a book called secrets of methamphetamine manufacture, which has so many errors in it that nothing will work as stated. See erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/eleusis/eleusis.vs.fester.html for a thorough analysis of the mistakes in this book. This new edition is equally as useless. The author obviously has no real knowledge of chemistry and He should be the last person on earth to write a book on this subject. It is a complete waste of money. You can find much more accurate information free on the internet.
Advanced Techniques of Clandestine Psychedelic & Amphetamine: This is a must-have for those interested in the processes of mind-altering potions! Who else, but the master himself, Uncle Fester, explores the methods for exploring one's own mind!
0 STARS - TERRIBLE: This is honestly the kind of stuff that gives metal and hardcore a bad name. Not only is this album overtly violent, cliched, and cheesy, but the songwriting lacks any sort of real talent and the songs mostly rely on their use of audio clips from movies and other such sources. Quite frankly, the cover art and song titles alone would and should be enough to justify and solidify my review of this piece of trash. I am surprised Tribunal even bothered with releasing two albums from this band when they have released much better albums and ep's in times past. If you want something new and good off this label, pick up the He Is Legend EP and if you just want something new and heavy, check out Unearth, Himsa, As I Lay Dying, or Glass Casket, but whatever you do, avoid this garbage.
Loosen Up Guys: Killwhitneydead is a source of comical relief in a world that's too serious. "Avoid this garbage"? "These guys give a bad name to hardcore"? Its kind of embarrassing that anyone can take this album that seriously. The songs are short, fun, witty, with influences drawing from neo classical metal to grindcore. THere is everything there: breakowns, blast beats, bitchin' solos, and dirty ass rock 'n' roll. There is also an abundance of movie samples that make the songs interesting. Listen to these guys with an open mind and remember, KILLWHITNEY DEAD HATE EVERYONE.
A LOT of samples...: but it seprates them from other bands, as well. It's like classic metal guitars, with solos everywhere, death metal vocals that you can understand because they're not gurgled, drums like a machine, and bass that will break a stereo. Very unique.
Works great: The wii's internal fan has a habit of burning out over time making gaming sessions over an hour impossible. This stand keeps the system cool and has a few extra features for good measure.
Run Away: Received the Dreamgear 4 in 1 cooling stand with high hopes only to have them crushed 5 minutes later as the fan quits working. Although the blue light still works it is completely esthetic and serves no useful purpose. I obviously do not recommend this productRun Away .................................................Fast!
Not impressed.: This item is poorly constructed. I was not at all impressed with the quality of the item for the price.
This doe NOT include an AC adapter!: I ordered this product specifically because I needed a replacement AC adapter for my Wii and the cooling station was a bonus. This item has a misleading title and I will be returning it.
I hate that the item was not what was advertized on the site. I wish o return it.: The site said that it was a wii charger-cooler, and it was just a stand with a fan I did not see the batteries that the pictures showed.
Wii Cooling stand: Before I purchased this our Wii would overheat & shut down frequently, making it too frustrating to play. This device works very well, the Wii has not shut down since I purchase it. I know that others have complained about the lighted base, (it is bright) but it lets you know that you have left it on. The battery charger is nice too. Very economical way to get more enjoyment out of the Wii, I recommend this item.
Good Stuff....: I just bought this and i found that it is very quiet and looks real cool with the blue light, fan could have been much bigger but then again what more can i ask, it does what is says and also has another usb port available in it, people you really can't complain good product great price!!!
Greatly Depressing.: I bought this book at a tag sale for 50 cents and if I remembered the address I'd return it. Alcoholism is sad and serious; however, Lewis is a self-indulgent egomaniacal narcissist who thinks he is the most important person to ever recover from the disease. He offers superficial reflections on his disease and recovery, and is barely able to conceal what this book is truly about: his obsession with himself, his career, and friends he repeatedly refers to as "famous" but never names. No idea who gave this man a book deal, or who edited it for that matter - it could be cut down to four pages and it would offer the same amount of value. Depressing.
The Other Great Depression: It's a dull book written by an ego starved comic wanna be. I was looking for humor but generally found it to be a tedious read.
Save Your Time (and money): What an absolute waste this is, and that comes from someone who's enjoyed Lewis's humor for more than twenty years. It's repetitious as hell, directionless, and not even clever or humorous. It seems to have gone straight from the tape recorder to the printer without the guiding touch of an editor who could have made this book a guide for those without addictions. Such a work could have been as informative as it was entertaining, but this work is neither, the total antithesis of what I expected from one as gifted as Lewis. A ponderous read to begin with, it crawls to a plodding pace as his health ostensibly improves. If the point of the book is to illustrate how a harrowing addiction drives away those who like you, then this book has succeeded.
depressing: I love Richard Lewis, but this book was actually ... depressing. I had to stop reading and just skim the rest. It was repetitious. I never really understood what pain of his childhood he was trying to escape by drinking. I think some editor should have fixed the tone to make it either funnier or more-serious-and-readable. It was too shticky to be meaningful, but too serious to be funny.
WHAT A WASTE OF KNOWLEDGE: This book may have a lot to say to people either in recovery or needing recovery but I was greatly put off by the foul language that appears to command Mr. Lewis' language skills. I hope he moves on to recovery of his communication skills next. What a shame to have a message to share and not be able to do it in a way that people who don't use profanity can relate to. Am I to believe that all people needing recovery from substance abuse are also consumed with disgusting expressions of the English language? I don't think so!! There is a better form of communication than what offensive language offers. Profanity is not a meausre of honesty.
My kids love these!: The C-Plus Cold Tablets are a godsend! My kids, now 3 and 4, have started taking these at 1 and 2, from the first sign of a cold all the way to the end. There have been times when I ran out and the difference is clear. The colds seem to be of shorter duration and not as severe. Plus, my kids LOVE them and always ask for them when they start sniffling with a runny nose. They were SO excited when at 3, they were allowed to take 3 tabs instead of 2!These work. I don't think you have to be adamant about giving them to your child every hour like the directions say, though. I keep them in my purse and at home and give it to them whenever I remember, which averages out to about every 3 hours or so, and they've still worked fine.I don't like medicating my children at such an early age, so I'm glad that these are all natural. Take with the Hyland's Cough and Cold and your child will be symptom free in no time!
Great!: These things work like a charm for simple colds, if caught early. I've been using them for two years and my son has been fighting off colds successfully. Greatly recommend it.
Ummm, no.: Tried these. I pretty sure this is a joke. I thought this was an herbal remedy, but it is a HOMEOPATHIC remedy, which I have learned the hard way are not the same thing. Educate yourself on the difference, because I did not and now I feel stupid. Herbal remedies contain herbs, which under research can be an active ingredient. These contain what? 1 billionth of a billionth of a few real herbs plus lactose sugar. That is why you can basically give these to newborns, because all it really is is milk sugar. My little boy stopped crying because he thought I was giving him candy, not because this treated him. I know there are those who swear by this....it is a pure placebo effect my friends. Again, your kids are getting a sweet, so of course they stop crying for a while. Ice those gums and give 'em a good teether, don't get sucked into this.
Excellent DVD Edition: Fantastic 2-disc set with all sorts of fun goodies! Especially great are clips from the opening premiere and "deconstructing" musical numbers like "Jolly Holiday" in which you see how the magic was made in the chalk drawing segment. A must-have for your movie collection!
classic!: a good movie i liked it better when i was little but it's still good the songs are rather fun, andrews and dyke were a cute couple that's to about it for this movie, have a SUPERCALIFRAJELISTICEXPEALALIIDOSES day (if that's how you spell correctly)
fabulous classic: Great family video beloved by every age group in our family. The new "pop-up video" feature is well done, informative, and entertaining. Worth the money to replace your old VHS version!
I could not get the video to play.: Every minute or so, it would stop and have to buffer. I tried pausing and it did not help. I tried starting from the beginning and it did not help at all
Shame on Disney for Ruining P.L. Travers' Books!: P.L. Travers rightfully objected to the way Disney's team ruined Mary Poppins' character. It was bad enough to turn it into a musical--the "real" Mary Poppins never sang--but adding cartoons?? Anyone of any age who has read the books **before** seeing the movie has found this very sappy, saccharine movie very hard to digest. I know I did when I was about 8 or 9 years old. I agree with another reviewer--this is one of Disney's worst movies ever. [...]
boring and annoying: It's always nice to look at Andrews, but here she doesn't have much personality, she's more like one of those colorful loud dolls in Disneyland who wave and enthusiastically sing "It's a Small World." Van Dyke's grimmacing is annoying. This film was so boring that I could never watch much of it.
HAHAHAHA! GIVE ME A BREAK: This is one of the worst films to hit the Disney masterpiece collection. It's an overrated movie for ages 5 and younger. The characters didn't interest me at all and The "CHIM CHIMITY" song was awful and so where were the other songs. If Disney dosent get their act together they will fall and DreamWorks will rise.
Mary Poppins Anniversary Edition: The product is fine, in good condition. And I apreciate the sender including a nice note - shows that she cares about what she does and her product. Thank you.
Surprised little ones Love it!: I saw this movie many moons ago when I was in grade school. I thought it was a magical, entertaining story. I bought it for my 2 and 3 year old as something I thought they'd enjoy when they got to grade school. I was surprised to see them riveted to it for most of the program. I was doubly surprised they wanted to watch it over and over again! I'm pretty sure it was the singing and dancing that held their attention. This is definitely a classic that even little ones will enjoy now!
60's classic: based off the British novel. full of magic and adventure. this movie was like Julie Andrews first movie. great for kids.
movie purchase: This movie is a timeless classic. I had no issues with delivery and the movie was in great condition. This is a movie to share with future generations.
Disney's absolute stellar best: This is, without a doubt, Disney's crowning acheivement in film. Even though there are many wonderful Disney films, this particular selection far surpasses most children's and many adult films I have ever seen. Julie Andrew's performance with a superbly chosen supporting cast could not be a more perfect accoutrement to P.L. Traver's book. In many cases, movies made from books are a disappointment; not in this case. I am a younger 'old-school' Disney fan, and like very few of the Disney movies made after the 60's and 70's because I grew up watching films like Dumbo, Bambi, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty. Children and adults of all ages will marvel and awe at the remarkable story presented here, and find themselves singing the amazing, well-written songs for years to come.
Now THIS is what I call a movie!: It doesn't matter if you're 7 or 70. This movie pleases everyone. It's got a great soundtrack (don't know if it's still available but I inherited my mom's old LP record!), great acting (anything with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke has to be good), and has some scenes where live action and animation are combined. This was all done without the technology of today, yet another reason to appreciate the work in this film. The remastered DVD editions are great. Not sure what extras come with the newest one but the one I saw in 2001 had a good section about the making of the film.I recommend this to anyone, and it will come as a blessing if you're sick of the garbage that Hollywood is making today.
I forgot how much I loved this movie!: Introducing this film to my kids was amazing -- I'm not sure how much they got out of it, but it's a rip-roaring good time, and they seemed happy with it. Certainly me and my wife appreciated seeing it again.
I love Amazon Prime: Amazon Prime makes things so easy. I love how easy it was to rent this movie. An old classic like this was great to share with my grandgirls.
Mary Poppins DVD: I am unable to play this Mary Poppins DVD as it is not for my region and will not play. My grandchildren were extremely disappointed and I felt I had been duped. I think Amazon should send me a replacement that will play in Australia. I have bought before and always been happy, but will hesitate before I buy from Amazon again.
they fixed what went wrong: when i got the movie it was broken they called me when i left a review and asked what was wrong and they fixed the problum they are a good compiny!
Classic book: The price was fair. Works fine and arrived on time. I'm happy with it.This is extra text to meet the stupid minimum requirements from Amazon.
Still Fresh!: I bought this as a birthday gift but now I wish that I had kept it for myself! Oh, Well!! Mary Poppins is truly a classic... and so am I!!!
Supercalifragilisticexpealidociously Fantabulous!: I have loved this movie since as far back as I can remember,and I never tire of watching Mary's wonderful magic, the mischeivous Jane and Michael, the humor of Bert, and just enjoying everything this movie has to offer. There are no boring parts, and I think the more you watch it, the better it gets. If you have never before seen this movie, I strongly reccommend that you do!
Mary Poppins in a classic that never gets old!: My family and I love this movie and I am going to get this for my mom for christmas because she has seen it since fourth grade and still loves this timeless classic. The content is for all ages, including helarious, beautiful, and exciting action. It's just the best!
Quite a bit of sticking and stalling: There is no question about the quality of the movie. It is an exceptonal production. My ONLY issue is with the quality of the disc. Why does it continually stick while running? I know the simple answer is "Check your dvd player" I ran other discs with no problems so I must assume it is a faulty disc. Is there perhaps some way that it can be safely cleaned? Incidentally, disc #2 ran with no problems.
It's a classic!: Mary Poppins is a classic Disney movie. This particular edition has some nice bonus features (nothing extraordinary), but for those who are interested in a regular DVD edition of a classic movie, you can't go wrong.
timeless classic: The extras on this version are wonderful. The best bonus on it is the backstage look at the making of the movie. Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews, among others, share stories about Walt and their experiences while making the movie. There are some especially touching stories about Walt Disney, and the elderly lady appearing in the song "feed the birds," which happened to be one of Walt's favorite songs.Another thing I enjoyed on the dvd, is footage from the 1964 gala premiere with some color footage even. There are numerous little facts and stories all throughout the bonus features that are sure to interest fans. Watching this dvd has made me like the movie even more, from realizing all the work that went into making this film. From the live action and animation combinations, to the choreography- Mary Poppins is one fine Disney classic and this is a very well put together dvd.
An Oldie for an Oldie: Saw this many years ago and saw something that reminded me about this great Movie sooooo!
The music did it: This was the first Disney movie released after I was born. The music did it for me & the musical numbers. Not the best, other wise the movie was too long.
Shared generational Entertainment: This classic movie was wonderful when my children were young and can still capture the attention of my grandchildren!It's entertaining and leaves all with a feeling of wellbeing!
Great movie!: Great to show as a treat for students who have done well for a quarter! Music, dancing and story line are a quality that today's children don't get to see often - they are tapping their toes and singing along!
Great family movie: I bought this movie for my children because I remember loving it when I was younger. It's a classic and fun for the whole family, as long as the children are old enough to understand what they're saying. I found that my four year old had a REALLY difficult time without help from me beacuse of the accents, rate of speech, and word choices. I guess I'll put it on the shelf for a couple more years then revisit the magic. :)
Fabulous: What a fabulous DVD. An age old story that I love to share over and over again with my granddaughter. It is truly wonderful and so nice to be able to put it on whenever she wants to watch it.
Brings in the family: My son finds it hillarious that this was one of my favorite movies when I was his age. Recently we have both started to try to find things that we both liked at different times. like a common ground. Although, when he first watched it he just wanted to watch Dick VanDyke make funny faces and we continually had to keep rewinding to those scenes, now he enjoys the entire movie and even collects Mary Poppins stuff, which is hard to find. But we are all in on it and it makes it like a scavenger hunt, who can find what. He even got a signature from Dick VanDyke himself. We both feel that he did not get enough credit for his rolls, but this is still truley a classic and a bringing together for all ages.
*The most beautiful way to watch Mary Poppins!!*: I knew from the moment it was released that it was going to be a beautiful dvd! I now know for myself! It is amazing! the picture quality and sound is mind-blowing! The screen format lets you see what you never saw before!
VCR or DVD as nanny...: Ok,so everyone parks the kids in front of the tube now and again. Nothing wrong with that when you can pop in one of the most cheerful children's classics ever. (Even grownups love the music--ok, admit it, you do.) The songs are brilliant, Julie Andrews sings like an angel, and Dick Van Dyke was a stroke of genius as Bert the chimney sweep--as lucky as can be!Other than the risk of hearing "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" to excess around the house after playing this film, what's not to like? The funny thing is that the movie is not exactly true to the more acerbic style Poppins of the P. L. Travers novels (she was NOT all sweetness and light, just read it.) But who cares, this is one kids' film that everyone loves. Up there with the Wizard of Oz.
How Lucky Jane and Michael Banks Were!!!!: I am a huge fan of Disney movies, and this is, by far, my favorite. Every time I watch it, I get a wonderful, happy, child-like, magical, goose-pimply feeling. Wouldn't it be wonderful to have a nanny like Mary Poppins!! Now that I have a child of my own, I CANNOT WAIT to introduce this movie to him. I'm a firm believer in reading to your children. My son is not 2 yet, and I have constantly read to him since he was an infant, but...this is one time where he'll see the movie before having the book(s) read to him. I've introduced this move to a nephew and a cousin and they were mesmerized. It made me enjoy the movie even more, watching it through their eyes. The songs are EXCELLENT. Dick Van Dyke is AMAZING (also check him out in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang) and Julie Andrews is at her BEST (along w/The Sound of Music). This is the magic of Disney at its best. (Other greats: Cinderella, Aladdin, Toy Story I & II).
BET YOU HUM the SONGS after VIEWING!: Take two unruley children in a banker's home and add a superb BRITISH NANNY (Julie Andrews) who seems to reveal a very bizarre personality when the children are out of their parent's range. One could say that Mary Poppins has a magical right-brain personality. Delightful adventure, catchy songs, terrific dancing, colorful scenes. Add Dick Van Dyke, David Tomslinson, Glynis Johns, Hermione Baddley, Reta Shaw, Arthur Treacher, and Reginald Owen who are just some of the many wonderful performers in this dynamic, early-Disney musical.
Great music, great fun!: As my 2.5 year old son loves this movie, I have had to watch it at least 20 times. Yet I still enjoy it. The music and lyrics are great fun, and I find myself humming the tunes hours after each viewing. The acting is excellent, and the charachters are charming.
Purely Magnificent!: This is the greatest Disney film of all time. Story, songs, effects, and endless attention to detail are a true wonder. The performances are the icing on this cake, with Julie Andrews well deserving of her Oscar. It's so easy to see why everyone fell in love with her.
The perfect children's movie: I have numerous happy memories of seeing Mary Poppins since the first time (on its re-release in 1980). I go back to it time and again and have never been bored yet! Highlights - the horse race and the dancing cartoon waiter penguins; Chim Chim Chiree and the acrobatic chimney sweeps; Mrs Banks (Glynis Johns) and her 'Votes for Women'; Reginald Owen's Admiral (with a ship on the roof of his house!); the gorgeous 'Feed the Birds'; the special effects in 'A Spoonful of Sugar'; Ed Wynn as the giggling Uncle Albert; and of course the brilliant performances from Julie Andrews as Mary, Dick van Dyke as Bert/Mr Dawes senior, Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber as the children Jane and Michael, Hermoine Baddeley as the maid, and David Tomlinson as Mr Banks. Absolutely brilliant and definitely makes you remember being a child with a big smile on your face. Those who don't like it possibly came to it too late in life, but I can't fault it.
An end of an era.: Probably one of the greatest works of the late Walt Disney himself. After this film the Disney studio completely lost their touch in creating a great film."Mary Poppins" is everything that is fun and is wonderfully acted by Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. The colors, the music score, the story, costumes, set design is all a wonderful tribute to the greatest creative artist of all times, Walt Disney. The likes of him will never be seen again. The DVD version is also wonderful, the quality is excellent and is still one of my favorite films of all times. This is truly a classic for both young and old.
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever"...: Another quote from the movie that accurately describes this classic. The music, dancing, and singing all make a great film. The DVD includes the best extras, like the making of featurette as well as film from the movie's premiere. This is a top-notch Disney musical that belongs in any DVD collection.
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!: Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke did outstanding jobs inthis timeless Disney classic!Andrews is wonderful as thekind-hearted yet strict nanny,and Van Dyke's performanceof Burt is very good;Van Dyke's Cockney accent is very well-performed and convincing!The scenery is colorful and verywell-done,and the performers are superb!David Tomlisin isperfect as the no-nonsense banker George Banks,and ReginaldOwen is wonderful as the elderly Admiral Boom!And whocan forget songs like the touching"Feed the Birds"or thelively "Step in Time"?Young and old alike will be entertainedby this film.A must-have for any Disney collection!
You Have to See This Movie: Walt Disney's "Mary Poppins" is a glorious family film. Though I have only seen it on DVD (I wasn't born in 1964 when it opened at Radio City Music Hall), I was quite impressed by the special effects of the time including the "Jolly Holiday" sequence with dancing penquins, singing ducks and so on. Andrews is a class act. Dick Van Dyke is wonderful as Bert. And the songs are the kind of showtunes you'll sing again and again.
Completely Amazing!: Perfect for the 7 year old, a bit out of reach for the 5 year old and totally not for the 3 year old but so fantastic all round that I cannot stop singing the songs. I think the kids will want to watch this every Sunday - forever! There is one scary scene when the kids run away from their father and encounter some stragglers on the streets but generally it is a pure, safe, and wonderful family dvd!
Great movie, poor DVD: The movie is great, but not the DVD.Some times DVDs have this annoying "Coming soon" thing where you have to press the "menu" button to get to what you've paid for. Guess what, on this DVD... menu button is disabled, forcing you to >>| to the part that you care about.
best: best kids movie of all time julie andrews and dick do a great job with the kids jumping in to drowings and having tea way up in the air
Wonderful, Wonderful MOVIE!: I would recommend this movie to everyone! This movie never gets old. I remember watching it when I was a little girl and now, sharing it with my grandchildren. They LOVE it and have been going around the house, singing the familiar tunes!
Best Disney musical ever: During the 90's Disney flicks were lame, drippy musicals. This is not the case with Mary Poppins. The songs are still fresh and vibrant. As a whole this is the most re-watchable musical flick ever, so I'm happy to have it in DVD. Highly recommended to adults, even those that were put off Disney by "The Little Mermaid" and the rest of the Eisner era dreck-to-theater.However, I have to admit that from a technical point of view, Mary Poppins shows its age. The blend between humans and cartoons is not that good, so you have to try harder to keep your disbelief suspended.Anyway, it has great nostalgic value for me. Perhaps kids might like it, too... I'll show it to my little nephews and tell you later.
FANTASIC 40TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION: A great deluxe treament to an equally great film. Julie Andrews in her first film is just spellbinding as "Mary Poppins". The DVD has a great transfer and a load of interesting extras. One of Disneys finest moments.
I Love This Movie: As a ten year old boy at the theater I was mesmerized buy this wonderful movie. I remember feeling so excited and thinking this is the greatest film of all time. As an adult, I reconnect with that child's enthusiasm every time I see Mary Poppins, although the attraction I felt for Julie Andrews is better understood. There are not enough adjectives to describe it but enchanting stands out. Unforgettable and a touch of true magic from Disney. Julie Andrews will always be frozen in time for me and what a fantastic treasure she is.
A feel good Disney Movie: Is there no better movie out there than Mary Poppins. With stars Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, you are assured of great acting and music. Dick Van Dyke for me is one of the greates actors of all times, especially when you're talking his earlier works like this and 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'. His songs and acting are all fun and exciting.The special effects on this is definitely outdated by our standards but were cutting edge way back when.If you have kids, this will be worth your time. They love the way at the end when the kids take over the castle and put the 'Child Catcher' in the big net. He always disturbed me as a child, just something about the way way his face was made up. He has the same effect on my daughter as the Oompa Loompas of the orignal Wonka movie.
My Kid Loves It: This is more like a play, we don't need much settings. We have fewers characters and a simpler plot than The Sound of Music.Having said that, this is still a marvelous movie. I like the chimney sweeper and one man band. I like the part of Mary Poppins or even Mr Bank and his woman-liberalizing wife and even the captain next door-- he reminds me of Captain Shotover of Bernard Shaw. Now that Harry Potter, The Worst Witch are so popular, winds are certainly blowing Mary Poppins' way too. I rank this right next to The Sound of Music.
Family classic: My 4 year old son, 2 1/2 year old son and 1 year old daughter all enjoy this film. They mainly enjoy the singing but my 4 year old is able to get some of the jokes. A nice video for family movie night since it is not scary or too fast paced.
Won't buy until there's Blu-Ray: Simple as that! Disney is squeezing the final teet here and milking the masses for another, "Gotta Own" DVD. I won't buy this until the Blu-Ray comes out.
The years have not been kind to this one: Like all of us, our granddaughter loves movies. She's watched classics like the Wizard of Oz (a fave!), Black Beauty, and Dumbo countless times. While these films do show their age, they have nonetheless held up well over time and we've all viewed them over and over. I had never actually seen Mary Poppins until recently, and found this film to be quite disappointing--as did the grandchild, who was ready to hit the road before the kids even appeared. Everything about this movie is annoying, from the made-for-TV type effects, to the accents, to the very predictable story itself. It's neither fun, nor satisfying, and definitely not engaging for kids. Get the anniversary edition of Wizard of Oz instead--it's a far, far better film!
Wonderful movie!: I grew up watching Mary Poppins and loved it. So I wanted to share this movie with my 3 & 5 yr old daughters! They loved it too!!! A great movie we can share together!
Great movie for the whole family: This is a really nice movie. My 5 year daughter and 3 year old son love to watch this movie over and over again. This is a true classic that anyone should have in his kids DVD collection.
Poor quality online viewing: The online streamed version of this movie is NOT widescreen. It is pan & scan and looks like a low-quality YouTube video circa 2003. I did a bandwidth speedtest showing 10 Mbps download but Amazon's video connect shows 1 of 5 bars, so their video server cannot handle decent quality video. Refund please.
Mediocre Movie: "Mary Poppins" is a movie that I'm just going to say I never enjoyed, even as a kid. Yeah yeah, I have no soul or heart, but I just don't like this film one bit. I can't stand it when musicals come up with a musical number every five minutes. Musicals that do really annoy me, and this is an example. There's always talk that this movie was famous for combing live action and animation. but that's only for what--ten to fifteen minutes? There's no adventure, no heartwarming, it''s just people singing pointlessly. I remember getting bored with this utterly ridiculous movie. I'm not much a fan of the Sherman Brothers, or at least not in THIS movie. Mary Poppins herself is not an interesting character, correcting poor Michael when he's not perfect, just acting firm most of the time. I am definetly never going to buy this movie.
how?: How comes? You send me a dvd that you are very sure that it will not work in The United States ? You should have a king of alert, letting us know , before send,
Shame on Disney: It seems every time you turn around another "Special must have edition" comes out on any movie. With the ecnomy the way it is I would hope that the studio executive's would take that into consideration and not get us to buy another copy of a DVD we already own.I for one am not going to buy the 45th Anniversary Edition since I already own the 40th Anniversary Edition. If everyone waits 5 years you can probably buy the 50th Anniversary Edition.
boooh: I wander what they will put on the upcoming 50th anniversary edition.This is just money-making. nuff said
Practically perfect in every way: Everyone has seen Mary Poppins. Let's cut the mustard and talk about the DVD.Sound 3/5 - Using ProLogic receiver, the songs are blatantly pasted in. The difference in the sound quality during the transition from dialogue to song is horrible. On the bright side, the songs sound great, and the dialogue sound isn't that bad considering that the movie is 25 years old.Picture Quality 4.5/5 -Excellent.Extra Features 0/5 -There are none, so don't bother looking.
Mary Poppins- A Disney Original Classic: Disney's Mary Poppins is an amazing movie. Back in its day, no one had ever really seen animated characters dancing alongside real humans, and Disney made this possible. Mary Poppins has stood the test of time, making it a Disney Classic, and for many years to come. This movie is excellent for the young, and young at heart. The tunes get your feet tapping and you sing the songs, and when it's over, you want to watch it all over again(or buy the CD)! This is a great movie for the whole family, brought to you by Disney.
What can you say?: Mary Poppins, what else needs to be said. My children, who claim to be too cool for this old film, thoroughly enjoyed it.
special fun: This special edition was most enjoyable. The added video of the musical play adaptation was delightful. It was fun seeing this magical musical classic again after seeing it in the movies when I was a kid. It keeps the young in me. Mary Poppins just keeps the medicine as sweet as ever.
Childhood Revisited: It's 1964 again and I'm 10 years old. This 45th Anniversary edition of Mary Poppins is wonderful. I love it just as much now as I did when I saw it at the movie theatre. I would recommend this DVD to everyone.
Mary Poppins: This will always be enjoyed by generations to come. Julie Andrews was the perfect choice for Maria. Loved the extras with the film.
Mary Poppins (40th Anniversary Edition): Mary Poppins (40th Anniversary Edition)Excellent video; my granddaughter just LOVES it; she has been watching it repeatedly since she received it. Highly recommend this movie for 3 years and up.
Mary Poppins: The kids love this classic movie. They sing and dance to it all the time. My husband was tired of it after the 7 time in one week.
Very good: It is a very good movie! A classic and my kids love to watch it! Fun for the whole family!
Great movie: Excellent price for an excellent movie. Definitely recommended for anyone looking for a good movie to watch with the family.
JULIE ANDREWS`FIRST MIRACLE FILM: MARY POPPINS(1964) is (with MGM`s The Wizard Of Oz) the best children`s film ever. And what a joy that it doesn`t seem to date; it`s so much fun to show our childhood favorite to our children and see that THEY enjoy it as well. It`s a Disney product and of course Disney has no peer.
love this movie: Watched it a lot when my kids were little. it was just as great to see it again. We'd keep on watching it!
Even Better than Remembered: It is amazing that a movie that I have seen so many times can still bring such joy. It was especially fun since I was able to share it with my 16 year old daughter. We loved it . . . again!
Where's the Blu-ray version?: I understand this version is nearly identical to the last release from five years ago which celebrated the 40th anniversary of this charming film. This time they have included nearly an hours worth of additional material documenting the wildly successful broadway production. I have enjoyed this movie for years and now my family runs when I put it on (smile) but I LOVE it! So my BIG question is...where is the Blu-ray version??? (thus the one star deduction for a five star movie). In the meantime I'll hold onto the 40th Anniversary edition. Unless you own one the original DVD releases I see no reason to upgrade at this time.
Marry poppins: A delightful movie the whole family will enjoy. July Andrews sure did earn her Academy award.
the best!: I was about maybe? 10, when I went to the first movie I saw in a theater, and it was Mary Poppins! and I loved it, and when i got home, and told my parents , I wanted the record,they got it, for xmas, and my own record player! I never saw a color,movie before, in a theater,just black and white tv then! it was so great! and now, I want my daughter, and 3 grandkids, to see , Mary poppins! :o)))))) its been about, 40, yrs since I saw that movie, I was 6 then, but I know my daughter and grandkids, will love it! :o))))) I love to laugh!!!! hahahahaa! and chim ,chimeny,chimchimy,chim, to rue! LMAO!Only you oldies , will appreciate, what I mean! LOL!
Mary Poppins...'Nuff Sed!!: MARY POPPINS is classic Disney fare, and one of the best and timeless movie musicals in the history of film. It's great all around, and Julie Andrews deserved her Oscar. What this reviewer would like to reiterate is the performance of Dick Van Dyke. A solid performance with a British cockney accent, singing, and excellent physical dance routines (i.e. dancing with animated penguins!) to rival Gene Kelly. Not bad for someone who really isn't a trained dancer. Dick Van Dyke's starring role equaled that of Julie Andrews and probably was the highpoint of his career next to his tv show. If given a lifetime award, it would be for this performance. If someone else had the part of Bert, the film would not be the classic it is today. Kudos to Dick Van Dyke and to MARY POPPINS.
Sure to get your children dancing!: My 2 year old LOVES this movie!!! I bought this hoping we could share it, and it has been a HUGE hit! The music, actors, and animation are perfect for adults and children. But be warned, my daughter was so excited dancing with the movie, she danced right into a wall. She's fine now, and still loves it, and just can't help but get up and dance around the house whenever it's on. It's a little long at 139 minutes, but when everyone is happy, it goes by quickly.
This item worthless: I made the big mistake of buying this peace of junk.The PC link to this thing doesn't work at all, it timesout before anything can synch.The directions that come with it are useless. The help inside the sync program is even more useless.Too bad it would have been nice if it did work.
Less than worthless: Anyone reading this, please don't waste your time and your money. The design is attractive, the price is incredible ... but then it is an absolute piece of junk, so its far too expensive. DON'T bother buying it. We got one, thought it was faulty because it does NOTHING, returned it and the replacement was exactly the same. We are now claiming our money back! Amazon should be embarassed selling it and Franklin Rolodex, such a fine name, should remove it from the market at once and stop taking people for a ride! Shame on them! It gets ZERO rating!! I had to put 1 star because they don't have zero!
Dancing in the Rain...: ...is the only way to describe how this book makes me feel. When I open the cover I am hit with Gibran's beautiful aphorisms which run through my body like electricity. With each reading the book changes. Some will explode out of the page one time and the next hide in the shadows. Some that I carry with me always are:~Rememberance is a form of meeting.~Forgetfulness is a form of freedom.~How can I lose faith in the justice of life, when the dreams of those who sleep upon feathers are not more beautiful than the dreams of those who sleep upon the earth?It is a wonderful book in every way. I can't say enough about the beauty contained within.
Phunky Phunky ...: I had a blast at their video taping of Bounce and had the opportunity to hear some of their other stuff! Love it! I'm having a hard time finding this one. Please re-release it! Phunk Junkeez are phantastic!
A Great Fun CD: This cd is just a blast to listen to. I have had it for over 3 years now and still love to listen to it. If you are easily offended you should not buy this cd though. This cd is totally a party cd or a cd that will help to put you in a good mood after a hard day. Just sit back listen and go crazy.
lacks the funk: not as good as injected and fear of a wack planet but it is ok but not all that good. i think phunk junkeez got there sound rocking on injected but in this cd there sound isn't all that rockin. so buy injected first then buy this cd.
the cassette adapter: this product was the best. we had some old cassette movies we could not watch anymore so i ordered this cassette adapter and we can enjoy our old movies again. a great product.
Low priced handy device. Get it!: I had to transfer all my childhood memories from VHS-C to DVD. Once I had this device I managed to play the old video cassettes on a regular VHS VCR, and recorded all of the tapes to DVD. From there I also uploaded the films to Google Video. Now I can access my childhood films anywhere, and preserve them, without risking loosing it. If you have old tapes at home, don't be lazy, get this adapter and copy the memories. You won't regret it!
This item is worthless.: The product is cheaply made and doesn't work. The door for sliding in the VHS-c tape jams, sticks, and is very difficult to use. This is a TDK brand and I actually have TDK brand vhs-c cassettes. Funny thing is - the TDK vhs-c tapes don't fit properly in the TDK brand adaptor. I had a previous vhs-c adaptor where the door slid open with a battery. That worked much better. I'm unable to use this to view my tapes. Buy another brand. This one is worthless.
NOT MOTORIZED: This is a manual adapter and there are much cheaper ones on the market out there. I personally had a dysfucntion...... and thought it was motorized buy the motorized one. This one is ok.
"On the Trail of the Wild": Mr. Ben-Shahar does a great job at presenting his research and personal experiences in various Southafrican bush areas. In addition to his interesting narratives, Ben-Shahar provides us with the opportunity to enjoy some of his outstanding photographs. A must read if planning a trip to a Southafrican destination.
JEET KUNE DO -- THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE PRESENTED: "JEET KUNE DO: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way" is THE definitive book on Bruce Lee's martial art. John Little has done a superlative job of locating, formatting, editing and presenting Bruce Lee's writings in a manner that is comprehensible, informative and inspiring. In many ways this book far surpasses "The Tao of Jeet Kune Do" which, in comparison, looks to be so many of Bruce's notes simply tossed into a stew. This book presents Bruce Lee's writings and sketches on his art of Jeet Kune Do in an organized and comprehensive manner -- much like Bruce Lee presented it himself when he created his art in 1967. This book is, quite simply, the best book on Jeet Kune Do ever written. But then, that shouldn't be suprising -- it was written by Bruce Lee.
A great read: I don't like reading too much, but I read this over and over. Either get this one or the Tao of Jeet Kune Do. There is much overlap, and you can probably do almost as well with one or the other. The difference is that Tao of JKD is written by Lee, and this was compiled from Lee's notes. In addition I recommend Art of Expressing the Human Body, which I think is volume 4 in this series. While this book gives you the techniques themselves, The Art of Expressing... tells you how to train your strength and power and speed, etc. in order to make the techniques more effective.
Great book, I've read it 4 times!!!!: I've read this book 4 times and each time I get something new out of it. I really think that this will help the serious martial artist out there or anyone that is thinking about joining a martial art.
Tao of Jeet Kune Do: This has to be the definitive book on Bruce Lee's martial art. If you own this you do not need "The Tao of Jeet Kune Do". John Little has done a great job of locating, formatting, editing and presenting Bruce Lee's writings in a manner that is easy to read, espcially when compared to "The Tao of Jeet Kune Do" which, in comparison, looks to be so many of Bruce's notes just randomly written. This book presents Bruce Lee's writings and sketches on his art of Jeet Kune Do in an organized and comprehensive manner.This book is, quite simply, the best book on Jeet Kune Do ever written.
Great insight on Lee's art of Jeet Kune Do: Great book on Lee's martial art of Jeet Kune Do (JKD). The book has drawings that were taken from his original notes as well as his thoughts, theories, fighting strategies, excercises, etc. Similar to "The Tao Of Jeet Kune Do", this book is really like a good look into Lee's own personal notes.
it's a good book but a confusing read.: I found this book to contain decent information regarding Bruce's method(s) for effective fighting. The thoughts contained are not complete, often they resemble simple lists or phrases without thurough explanation. The way in which this book is organized is very similar to the Tao of Jeet Kune Do, by Bruce himself. It sould be stated that the information in this book is decent information; it just needs to be weeded out. Plan on spending a little more time studying this book than you would on a "typical" martial arts book.
Very Good Addition to the Tao of JKD: This book is a great addition to the original Tao of JKD book. It has even more thoughts of Bruce Lee compiled in this good sized book. You can never stop learning from all his books. There seems to be something new every time! It's just up to us to take what he has written and transform it to our own way...our own JKD...which is what the total product is of "honestly expressing yourself"...which I think can take a man 100 years or more. So read up, learn, and train hard!Be Water, My Friend. - Bruce Lee
Best Watch Ever?: The Casio F91W1 is perhaps the greatest time piece ever created since Harrison invented the first reliable watch in Greenwich England. It is classy, sleek, reliable and the battery lasts 7 years. While most people strive to constantly score bigger, brighter, clunkier and more expensive watches, I'll stick with the basics - thank you very much.
The all-time digital classic: I bought a watch like this in the early 80s, and since then I've bought many watches, but for some reason, I always return to this classic digital watch as my favorite piece to wear on my wrist. It's light and almost unnoticeable. It doesn't have that many thrills, it's barely water resistant, but it has the simple classic look the digital watches I remember from my childhood. Yes, you can buy a bulky G-Shock or whatever, but this watch is one of its kind. It will not stand out and blend in nicely with any attire, even business suits. Wear it and be proud!
Practical, reliable, durable, political.: It's an excellent little watch. It's light, waterproof enough for swimming, keeps accurate time, has a light to read the time it in the dark, and it's cheap enough that it's not a big deal if you lose it. It's also the watch listed in the Combat Status Review Tribunal transcripts of 18 Guantanamo detainees and given as a reason for their continued detention. (Wikipedia: "Casio F91W") It's a unique conversation piece, a political statement, and a practical purchase all rolled into one.
poor alternative to Casio W-71: the features on this watch are very minimal and not well laid out.you can get a very similar looking watch with a LOT more useful features, the Casio W-71not only that, but this watch is featured twice on Amazon; search 'F-91W' and the same watch comes up at $11.48 w/ free S.S. shipping. Even at that price, I suggest not getting it.No month or year on displayNo count-down timeretc.(see my other review on the other offering of this watch for more details)Spend a little more and get the W-71-1V for $18.45.
Perfect watch!: This watch has everything I want and nothing I don't. I wanted a light, stopwatch, alarm, day and date displayed, water-resistance, small face, cheap price, easy to use, and reliable. I set it to US official time and checked it a month later, it was only 7 seconds fast. Casio has kept making this time-tested, user-friendly design for a long time, and I hope to be able to buy another one when this one breaks in 20 years.
The author just doesn't understand: I read the book and agreed with some points and threw the book down indisgust at other points.As a woman who adores high heels, makeup, perfume, fancy clothes, a fewpiercings, and a tattoo on my ...umm never mind, I must admit it isenjoyable and empowering to be able to dress and express myself this way.I do not dress for men, but for myself.The author does not seem to realize the vast majority of women enjoydressing and being feminine.By the way, high heels only hurt if you are not accustomed to them. Theydon't damage your feet if you purchase the right size and shape.
Sacred and Scary Reflections on Neo-Biologicial Civilization: First published in 1991, this is a gem that should be one of the first readings of anyone contemplated the sacred and the scary aspects of how humans, machines, and software are being changed by emerging information technologies. While there is a lot of focus on "cool tools" and all the paraphenalia of "virtual reality" qua artificial sensation and perception, the rock bottom foundation of this book can be found in Howard reflections on what it all means for the transformation of humans, business, and society in general.
Careful! Only charges ONE remote: The name is very misleading! "Dual Charger" means there are 2 different ways to charge ONE remote. You can buy a true "Double Charger" for the same money.
Never worked: I orderedWii Charge 'N Play Dual Chargeras a Christmas present for my granddaughter. By the time I found out that it didn't work, the 30 day return period for Beach Audio had passed and they were unwilling to help me with a replacement. They gave me a 877 number for the manufacturer and I'm still waiting for a call back. I'm very disappointed.
Not worth it!: The cartridge that came with the vicks humidifier only lasted about 10 fillings (they claim 30-40). I think it would be just as cost effective (and easier) to just buy distilled water to use in the humidifier, and skip the filter cartridge.
Took out lots of gunk: Our filter lasted for an entire season, used only on very dry days which is all we needed. It took out lots of mineral gunk, although it would take special equipment to see how much was left in. Certainly cheap enough at Amazon.DC-51 Kaz Replacement Demineralization Cartridge
fell apart: used the cartridge and it deteriorated. my wife ended up buying these little drop in units that sit in the tank.
Unfortunately, one size does not fit all.: I had ordered the Sunbeam Model 6589 Ultrasonic Demineralization Cartridge but was sent the DC-51 as a replacement because the 6589 is no longer being manufactured. Unfortunately, the DC-51 is about 1/2" thicker than the original 6589 and that extra thickness prevented the tank for my Sunbeam Model 701 Ultrasonic Humidifier from being able to seat properly. I am unable to use purified water with my Sunbeam, so the dreaded "white dust" problem made it necessary to return the entire humidifier because there is no usable demineralization cartridge available for it.A very poor job of coordinating specifications for a replacement of a discontinued product, in my opinion. I suspect that some other Sunbeam Ultrasonic Humidifiers will have similar problems using the Kaz DC-51 as a replacement for the 6589 because of their similar design.
I hate giving 1 stars: I do hate giving 1 stars but I have to in this case. I think it is better to just buy distilled water (and no filter) for your humidifier.
De-mineralization cartdrige: a goey stuff forms in spite of the filter that clogs the humidifier from creating the mist. Much dissapointed
Never used the item: The Sunbeam 696 really didn't work well so I never used the cartridges. They seemed okay.
Good product: This product works very well but it is expensive and a pain to buy each month. I change mine often because of the chemicals in my water. I like it other than the cost.
Does it's job: I use my Vicks cool mist humidifier in my bird room. The demineralization cartridge helps keep the mineral build up from forming on my unit.
Does its job: I bought this cartridge on here since I can never find it in any of the stores I shop at. It seems to do what it is supposed to...we use tap water in our humidifier and we only have to clean the humidifier sensor/plate (not sure what it's called) about once a month which is better than once a week since we have hard water.
nice sheets: I received these sheets as shower gifts and also received Pottery Barn Kids sheets. I cannot find a difference. They both fit the same and feel to be the same thread count ( and became softer after a couple of washes). For the money, I would recommend these as they seem the same in quality as the more expensive PBK ones.
Atlantis: Great book for my second grader. He was fascinated. The cover is misleading. It makes it look like the book is about sea creatures. It's not. It's filled with interesting facts about the lost city. Worth buying.
Let me save you some money.: I have scratches on my urethane treated oak floor. I opened the product box and was directed to put drops of water on the scratches. If the floor turned black, the instructions said not to use the product, indicating that the scratches are too deep. Do this before ordering the product. I don't know if it works on scratches that are not deep, but for what it's worth, I did not consider mine to be deep.
Book Review: Probably the single worst book I have ever read. It took weeks to read it because I would think I was just going to give up on it. I finally made myself finish thinking it would get better but it did not. Very depressing book.
APPROPRIATELY AWESOME! A Magnificent score restored!: Here, at last, is the legendary Miklos Rozsa's COMPLETE score to the 1961 biblical epic KING OF KINGS, beautifully restored and presented by the people at Turner and Rhino. Those of us who love this score were subjected to an LP in the 1960s that only contained a fraction of the score. When KING OF KINGS finally arrived on CD, there was more of the score available, but it all sounded dreadful. Now, the errors of the past have been rectified, and all the beauty and nuance of Rozsa's music is here, and thensome! There are cues included here that weren't even in the film itself (as released). This is a true treasure for anyone who loves great film music, with incredible sound (hard to believe this was recorded 40+ years ago) and a beautiful package that lovingly re-creates the original souvenir program that accompanied the old roadshow presentations of this epic masterpiece. Grab this one, and you won't be able to stop playing it!
Thank goodness for meastering!: I think was probably one of the last people to purchase the original deluxe edition of this disc in vinyl before MGM stopped making it. I paid about as much for it as I did for this wonderful new release.I even had the souvenier program that came with it. Only problem with the one in the new set is the very small print. Anyway, the newly remastered disc is a true masterpiece. I didnt realize how much music had been eliminated from the original recording,even though I purchased the video several years ago. I particularly liked some of the background information,which pretty much summed up my feelings about the movie being underappreciated for years. The same can certainly be said for this wonderous CD!Bravo!
The Mother of Soundtracks: This is simply one of the most beautiful scores ever written! You can even hear that todays composers, like John Williams, are influenced by Miklos Rozsa's music. A fitting soundtrack to one of the best Bible adaptations for the big screen. This is a MUST for every collector!
poor quality: These sheets are too big for our queen sized bed and wrinkle up. They also have pills all over which don't feel good on my skin. I am disappointed in the quality.
The sheets are great.: Bought some for my queen and king size beds and are very pleased with them. Plan to buy more.
pretty good gun: This gun is pretty good. It is kind of powerful but not as powerful as a spring. The laser isnt accurate and after a few days my trigger got stuck. It takes forever to load if you dont have a speed loader but it comes with the gun. It has a semi and automatic switch. It is pretty big. Overall it is a pretty good gun
Great Value: You won't regret this purchase. Accurate, easy to handle. Sights are a bit crude, but with its fps and rate of fire you don't need 'em.
poor customer service: We ordered a gun and received it Oct 30th. It was broken by Nov 4th. We are still waiting for a replacement and it is now Feb. We have emailed the company several times. This has been the worst customer service ever. Do not buy from DNS. I wish we would have paid attention to the bad reviews.
not too good.: not too good of a gun. for the price it isnt really worth it. The gun does shoot pretty well though, it does hurt at 15feet but anything beyond 20 it just feels like a mosquito bite. If u use the fake silencer the bullets fly everywhere. and my semi and full auto switch broke really easily. i do recommend this gun if u just wanna mess with ur friends, but if u actually wanna play dont buy this gun.
DONT WASTE MONEY AND TIME: (im 16 didnt feel like messing with the other form)This gun looks really good but 2 of my friends bought this gun the same day and got it the same day and i went with them and used it the first night with a full battary and it was shotting pretty good but the next day we went to play and both guns didnt work. I would recomend if your going to want to play alot of airsoft to buy a big name brand and not get f'd over like i saw 2 people.
Motherboard died after inmediately 2 years of use: This computer is the first and last Sony laptop I will buy. Immediately after 2 years, the computer cannot be used for more than one hour. I took it to a Sony repair specialist who determined the mother board had died. Estimated repairs were quoted at +$800 which nowadays can buy a Centrino Duo notebook (New). I am very dissapointed with SONY, this item was purchased at nearly $1,600.00 two years ago, now it's gone. I do not recommend SONY notebooks because of their poor quality control, this is not an isolated case: I know of three other customers with identical quality control problems in one city alone. Toshiba, DELL, and Gateway are best buys. I have never had any problems with those brands. Serial number for my machine is 281792309321022 should anyone at SONY wish to contact me.
Bad Bad Bad product watch out: For all of you out there do not fall to this cheap product.I bought a sony notebook PCG-K13 last year and paid a lot of money thinking I am getting a SONY quality and it turned out it has a major problem that all notebooks of sony have. It overheats very fast and finally the hard drive died and even after buying a new hard drive the problem persisted. SO for those who are lucky enough to check this DO NOt buy this product. I am sad :(
Not all bad but wouldnt buy again: -My battery died within 6 mos-The internal wireless card went bad after about 2 yrs. Unfortunately it also causes Windows to crash if I even switch it on. Luckily it doesnt bother Linux.-The HDD has just died at a little under 3 yrs.These failures are common in laptops that travel often and used roughly. However I used this as a desktop comp with very little travelling.OTH I very much like the LCD. And I will be upgrading the memory and the HDD to extend its life, as well as pull the wlan and upgrade cooling as it always ran hot.
CLASSIC DESIGN, GREAT DEAL: GREAT FOR OUR FAMILY OF 5. WITH THREE SMALL CHILDREN AGES 4 AND UNDER THIS SET IS GREAT FOR ALL HANDS YOUNG AND OLD. SOME FLATWARE IS TO HEAVY FOR THE KIDS BUT THIS ONE IS JUST RIGHT. FOR THE PRICE YOU CAN'T BEAT IT (GOT MINE ON SALE FOR $30 HERE ON AMAZON). I'LL PROBABLY BE ORDERING ANOTHER SET SOON!
Rough edges: The set arrived in about 4 days, which was very fast. The material is of high quality 18/10, heavy weight, continental size(which means larger than the standard place settings), and quite a nice polish. The problem I have is the side edges have a rough finish, almost like they forgot to buff out the square edges. Other than the serving pieces, all the forks and spoons have this rough edge, which does not match the high quality of the set. I don't know if this is the Riveria style, but I highly doubt it. I compared it to the pieces from Oneida at LNT, as well as the 2 styles from Costco, and they have nice rounded edges, unlike these. I don't know if others notice this, or I just received a bad set. I'm returning these for exchange or refund.
Great Silverware, outstanding value: I was epecting this silverware to be plane jane, run of the mill stuff. In fact, it is nice and heavy and the finish is excellent. They go through the dishwasher and come out with no spots or stains on them at all, as they should. This seems like a top quality set of flatware. Would definitely recommend.
It's OK, I Guess :-(: Well I have been a fanof the Tony Hawk seriespro skater 1 came out.Downhill jam isn't as greatas I thought it would be.It get's boring after the first 15 races andit seems like you're just playingthe same race every time just on a new course.This game was a BIG dissapointment
It doesn't use the skateboard for the wii: When I checked out this game it kept showing that everyone bought the skateboard with it. I didn't find anywhere that the board wasn't used. We got our 5 year old this game and the skateboard for his birthday. He loved them both. Too bad they don't get used together. The game is fun but we are still very disappointed that Amazon keeps showing this game often sold with the board. It is very misleading.
My 4 & 6 year old love it!: We did research on this game, and found many "professional" gamers dislike for the simplicity. Let me tell you that for $[...] this game is a steal. My two boys play it all the time, and jump around while steering their skateboard, and trying tricks that no human could ever pull off or survive from. Some of the background music choices aren't my favorites by any stretch of the imagination, but if you can get over that then this game is great for young gamers. Toys R Us was selling this game for $[...] this past fall.
well worth the price: Granted I got this during a gold deal...but it is a great game even at regular price. Good graphics. It was a little tricky to master at first, as there are a number of special moves you have to do to get lots of points. However once you learn them it is fantastic. Highly recommended!
Inspiring: If you reed this book and do what it say, you may Inspire Any Audience. Of course there are things that are more common in the American Market but it's not difficult to customize it to any country. I did it for Brazilian Market.
Practical: If you desire to motivate or keep your audience interested, this is a practical, helpful book.
Dangerous Depths: Third in a great series. This book, in particular, will take you for a ride both above and underwater with enough twists and surprises to satisfy any reader. I have a love of diving and a healthy respect for the Sea. It is obvious Kathy Brandt does too. Through her facinating main character, Hannah Sampson, she tells a heck of a yarn, but in so doing gives us all a tast of beauty, danger, romance and the need to respect our "one earth" and its endangered species.
Dangerous Depths: An Underwater Investigation: This book contained very indepth information about the British Virgin Islands (BVI)including not only information about the island groupings and their names but also detailed descriptions of the underwater world around the islands; the coral varieties, fish, sharks, etc. The novel easily kept you enthralled with mystery, intrigue, suspense, with a bit of romance thrown in on the side.Before purchasig this item it would be helpful to know this book is the 3rd book of a four book series. You could read it as a stand alone, but trust me, you'll enjoy it so much more if you read the previous two books first. There is also a fourth book in the series which end leaves the reader in suspense, hoping there will be subsequent books in this series.
Part of a great series: And this is a great book in that series. An easy and enjoyable read, very entertaining, and wonderfully written.
Loved it on YouTube....: Billy Connolly's look at Route 66 proved way more insightful than one might think- at least from what I could see on the Web. We were taken to places rarely visited in your typical 66 documentaries and we met folks rarely interviewed. I was therefore very disappointed when after a long,long wait the Blue-ray discs were either defective, or not for North America. The discs load, one can navigate the menu, but there is no access to the programs.
Region B: I waited 2 months for this Blu Ray. Finally received it and tried to play it. It did not work because I was sent a region B dvd that will not play on dvd players in North America. Thanks for making me wait and sending a dvd that I can't watch.
Good quality, vintage style.: The shirt is comfortable enough to sleep in and did not appear to change size after I washed it. It's pretty much what it claims to be. If you want a retro-looking CBGB shirt, then this one is fine.
#1: This album from yellowman is a must have."Yello the Best" is a great song.This album is worth listening too and production is great.Lots of new material.GET THIS.GET THis ALBUM if you know whats good for you wont be sorry
Birdhouse review: We purchased this product as a gift and were quite please with the quality and workmanship. The recepient loved it and wanted to know where we purchased it so they could buy more.
The Truth is Now: On [...], Patrick Mathieu tells us the ultimate truth in our lives. This truth transcends gender, race, nationality, religion, sexual orientation and education. It boils down to one word....NOW. "Now is the only time we ever have. Now is the only time you can be happy. Now is the only time you can be free."As a medical provider who has worked with hundreds of people dying, be it immediate or drawn out...I have heard this truth over and over again. You owe it to yourself to read the book, hear the message, and heed it with all you have. Your life depends on it.Barbara C. Phillips, NP, [...]
Perversions of Science: The Nazis used anything they could to justify their rule and the primacy of the "Aryan" race. They used many aspects of science to prove this point, but twisted and molded these ideas to suit National Socialist dogma. Heather Pringle's book investigates and illustrates how various sciences were used to show that "Aryans" were the superior race. Heinrich Himmler, being the dreamer he was, tried to twist history(prehistory) to show that the Germans were meant to rule the world and that they in fact were responsible for all the greatness of civilization. He enlisted scholars of all sorts to "flesh" this out. Along the way he encountered charaltans and crackpots and even respected acadmeics to his cause. Pringle tells this ghastly story well, well qualified from her earlier book about Mummies. This story will repluse some, but the lessons it teaches are well worth reading, it has exposed another of the inhumane and incredulous facet of the Third Reich.
A liberal, politically correct study: As a librarian and researcher of this topic, I feel that Edward P. Rich's Pazyryk Agenda has more unbiased information to offer than Ms. Pringle's study.Mr Rich's discussion of Ahnenerbe is the more extensive in scope, comparable to the writings of George Lincoln Rockwell. A real understanding of both of these phenomena is not possible without reading it.
Incredible Soundtrack: This is without a doubt, one of my favorite soundtracks I have ever owned! I listen to it constantly and it is the only music that can put me to sleep within 10 minutes if I am laying down. Each track is very diverse and is incredibly well-composed.
"Planet Earth"!: The Planet Earth soundtrack is one of the largest I own, (and I have about 15 including some other documentary soundtracks) and even then they couldn't fit every bit of music onto two discs! This is an amazing soundtrack and it really helped support the incredible visuals from the series.George Fenton is definitely one of the best documentary composers around. Along with Life in the Freezer and The Blue Planet, this is some of his best work, highly recommended!
The spirit of Christmas will always be here! <>< <>< <><: This video is a "must have" for any Touched By An Angel fan. It takes you on a road to the past, yet keeps you looking toward the future. You get a little history lesson on Mark Twain. The message, "Christmas is going to come, no matter what happens in your life."
Two very special episodes: In "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear" while Monica (Roma Downey) waits in a storm with young Joey (Paul Wittenburg), worrying about his brother Wayne (Randy Travis) who is out in a storm, she tells him a tale of another Christmas when Mark Twain suffered a crises of faith. Two-time Tony Award winner John Cullum ("Northern Exposure," "ER") is wonderful as Mark Twain! Helena Carroll, Kate Fuglei and Paul Winfield also guest star.In "There But for the Grace of God" Tess (Della Reese) takes to the streets to help a proud businessman (Gregory Harrision) who has become homeless. Ken Page (Broadway's "Cats"), Marion Ross and Malcolm-Jamal Warner also guest star.
Nice collection of short stories.: and a good introduction to Baxter's Xeelee universe. For hard sci fi fans only.
Outside is fine, but torn pages inside: This review is purely on the condition of the (new) book received. About 10 pages have been bent inward and torn upon receiving the book. Somehow, the outside of the book is in pretty good condition, although not what you would expect from a brand new book. However, the condition of the pages inside (which can clearly be seen as torn and bent from the outside) makes me wonder if the book was in such poor condition prior to shipping. The other book packaged with it was in mint condition.
Brilliant arc of future history: Difficult going at first with so many ideas and situations thrown at you that it seems a bit overwhelming. Stick with it, though. I finished this as I sat in the back of my truck on lunch break at a construction site and the words "wow" and "holy sh*t" came involunarily from my lips. The ten million year history is wrapped up in a sequence of stunning stories concerning the ultimate fate of humanity and the Universe, and it was a rush of sparking imagination with a wonderfully melancholy finish. I may have even wept. The scientific detail can get ridiculously esoteric at times, but the prose is solid as are the dialogue and characters. Excellent all around.
Dull and quite heavy !: When I first read stephen baxter's book "Time Ships", I was very satisfied with it. It has grandiose theme and very intriguing. I expected the same when I bought this "vacuum diagrams". But it seems that the quality of this title is not on the same class with "Time Ships". Baxter is not good on characterization but technically he knows the science well. However, I can only browse half of this book since it is boring and dull, also the science description is long and heavy.
Dreadful: I don't think I'm going to be able to finish this. Perhaps this is some new writing style but I find it tiresome and it makes me long for better use of my time. I've read earlier Baxter that was a lot better, these stories are rambling, incoherent, hallucinatory. There's a gee-whiz wowzo quality that makes me wonder if what I'm reading is intended to be made into a video game. If I had bought a physical book I would take it to a store and trade for some old Silverberg. Thumbs down.
Uh-uh: I read these glowing reviews, I ordered the book as a gift,and upon reading it first, discovered it wasn't all that insightful or charming. You can do better.
Business MIS not ethics: This text is highly reductionist. From the beginning his only concern is argue for protecting from monitary loss (he describes unethical behavior based on how much money you loose). In summary this is a book designed to develop a background for understanding why we have corporate security on IT/IS systems. The book really should be titled "MIS and Corporate Security the Current Social Backdrop".There is nothing real for the student to grab ahold of from an ethical stand point. Use this as source book for indentifying the current trends but don't expect it to cause your students to think.
Great for the price but purple!: This Bible is great for the price. The only thing that you should be aware of is that the Bible cover is purple. The general picture shows black, but the detailed "front cover" picture shows the purple color. I was surprised when I got the Bible since I thought it would be black. I was able to give it to a girl that was very happy though.
The Type is too Small on the NIV Gift Bible: The only problem we had with the purchase is the type being so much smaller than we expected; it is smaller than most standard gift Bibles we've recently purchased. Otherwise the product is what we expected.
Small print: I wanted to buy bibles for my young daughters for Easter. I picked this bible because it was a 4 for 3 promotion and was inexpensive to begin with. The bad part is that the font is about 8 point, and my daughters wear glasses. I ended up having to buy 2 more bibles. Why didn't the bible warn us not to buy cheap bibles that are on sale? I guess I will give them as gifts to kids who have eagle eyes.
Low Quality Bible: I purchased a leather bound NIV Gift & Award Bible, but was quite disappointed when the Bible I recieved was of poor quality plastic, and had no "study helps." Over all, I recieved a low quality Bible and was extremely disappointed!
It's Lasted 10 Years.: I've had this Bible for about 10 years now. In the last two I haven't used it so much. Mine is very worn but it still has years left on it. It is a good beginner Bible, it was my first.Pros:Long Lasting. Like I said it's 10 years old and still in decent shape.Great for a new believer.Cons:Font is smallNIV translation is horrible. It is one of the most inaccurate translations.There are many other Bibles and translations out there that I would recommend. Personally I like the NASB translation bound in genuine leatherhttp://www.amazon.com/American-Standard-Ultrathin-Reference-Genuine/dp/1581350260/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pdT1_S_nC?ie=UTF8&colid;=2Z09DPQ0H0UK5&coliid;=I1E5FPXMZ517L6It is more expensive but it is bound with genuine leather and the translation is, in my opinion, the best.
Praise for Lux Soap: I have been using this Lux soap for over65 years and I think it is still the best bath soap around. Several years ago, the grocery stores stopped stocking it. At that time I was able to order a case from Lever Brothers. I was getting very low and tried to order some more, but Lever Brothers had stopped making it. Fortunately Amazon came up with it and if you do your numbers, you'll figure out that I probably have enough to last me the rest of my life!
Great value.: I give each new grandchild a sterling cup and I love getting them at a good price. This cup is perfectly beautiful and more than I expected.
"CONSOLATION" gave me goosebumps!: This is such an impressive debut album...so many strong tracks.Each song has a different feel so I never get bored...I just let it keep playing in my car. My favorites are "Consolation", "More than you could know", and #4(formerly known as "kevin byrnes" :)) I'm looking forward to seeing a live show soon!!!
Raul Jose's Review: This recording has a lot to offer - great Brazilian music of several genres, wonderful arrangements of the music, and most importantly, Jane Duboc. Her musical depth (she is a vocalist, guitarist, pianist) shines through in this CD. I also enjoyed the periodic music snapshots in the CD, giving it a solid theme.
agrable: Agrable moment que d'couter ces mlodies au saxophone. Il manque ce genre de programme qu'on ne voit que trs rarement en compilation. A quand Fausto Danieli au saxophone en compilation ou Max Greger dans Sax in Gold.
Superstitious?: This book contains information about superstitions on a wide variety of subjects, listed in alphabetical order. It would take too long to mention everything this book contains, but I was fascinated by it. Some of the superstitions were ones I'd heard before, but much of it was new information. There were a few that puzzled me because they were the opposite of what I'd heard before. For example, the entry under Black Cat said, "Perhaps the most famous of all superstitions is the belief that a black cat crossing your path will ensure good luck." I've always thought that black cats were universally considered bad luck, but the book is British, so perhaps the superstition is different in Europe. Many of the superstitions described in the book are European, although there are also plenty from the U.S. and some from other areas of the world.
Low budget garbage: I purchased this "course" a couple of years ago when I was beginning to learn Swedish.I am now fluent. This "course" is effluent.It consists solely of a CD with 4 short swedish passages in it and little else.A mere 5 minutes on the web would garner more material than is in this CD.I purchased the CD because of the "reviews" on amazon.I can only surmise that these reviewers have a vested interest in giving their grossly misleading reviews. (employees of the producer of this useless course)I would not even buy this course second hand for 1 euro.
A rare find: I have to be up front and say that since historical fiction about early Georgia is so rare, I am heavily biased in favor of all books that deal with this subject. I can only think of three other books that are set in early Georgia: "Rascal's Heaven", "A Lesser Form of Patriotism",Rascals' HeavenA Lesser Form of Patriotismand "The Hornet's Nest". As a matter of fact, it this book very similar to "The Hornet's Nest" in style and content. That said, "Reap the Whirlwind" was a good book. Anyone who is interested in the American Revolution will find it interesting simply because it deals with the southern aspect of the conflict. This side is rarely encountered in historical fiction. Most works about the Revolution tend to be centered around the New England and Middle Colonies.
its ok if you dont have a picky hermit crab: my hermit crab wont eat this i dont know how other crabs like it. i wouldn't get it if your hermit crab aready has a favorit food.
Islam on the operation table: Excellent review of Islam, the philosophy and the practical implications that lead to 9/11.One major consequence - IRAN SHOULD BE DISARMED OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS before we face a horrible consequence, an apocalypse 10,000 more lethal....
Oh brother: Has this guy even studied history? I don't even know where to begin. But I know where to end - the book is awful. I had to give it one star, because zero isn't an option.
Intolerance: Having read excerpts of this ranting tome, I categorically denounce it as little more than intolerance of Islam. The author seems to delight in highlighting and discussing portions of The Koran that put Muhammad and Islam in a bad light, while ignoring the portions that stress spirituality and positive aspects of Islam. Don't buy this book.
Surely ignorance is bliss!: Well what can one say other than that this book is a work of an unprofessional writer, just out cashing in on a subject about which he has absolutely no idea. The title used is for personal gain (money)and his research into this subject is below zero. In todays world I believe a child with a basic knowledge would have done a better job. It tells more about the "hate" the so called author has for this religion and is cashing on the people's bias against this faith. Don't want to spend too much time on this unprofessional work. The only place for this book is file thirteen. Since "0" is no option I have rated it "1". why isn't zero an available option?
A bag of lies: A bag of lies, written with the sole intent of giving Islam a black eye...Certainly not a work of decent art.
A man with courage and forsight: I purchased this book along with a few other books by this author just before returning home. I did not expect much from this book since I thought I learned all there is to know about Islam already. To my surprise this author has put forth a book which is jam packed with real facts and truths about Islam. I admire his courage and I hope he does not end up being hunted by the good Muslims like they did with Salman Rushdie.What you will find is this book will shock you and no matter how harsh the author is in some cases the facts in the book are documented and valid. You will not find another book which exposes yet another evil side of a religion which is far from being peaceful.Bravo Mr. Tulbure!Mellisa Alderman
Check out who the author is first: Do yourself a favor, search the author's name on Google, and follow some of the links.
He downgrades all other books on Islam when he reviews them!: I don't know if it is him or not, but someone claiming to be him has the same comment for every book on the muslim world."This book leaves out much to be desired. You are better off reading "Islam Exposed" by Solomon Tulbure ISBN: 1932303456 "and gives them one star. Is this person a shill for the author or the author himself? Either way, combine this dishonesty with a sensationalized title and book content and you end up with a totally discredited book and author. Stay away!! Teach these people a lesson!
Ignorance and bigotry: I'm afraid this book was published for purely political reasons, by someone attempting to fuel the flames of anti-Islamic bigotry. It's a shame. If you're already a bigot and want your views confirmed, you'll love this book. If you actually know anything about Islam, you will probably be offended. If you don't know anything about Islam, and do not have pre-existing bigotry, please don't read this book as it will poison your mind. I am not a Muslim, and I am still offended someone would expend the energy to write this. Take a look at the ratings given on this site--you'll notice everyone here has given it a "1" or a "5." That should tell you something right there.
5 of the 5-star reviews come from the Author himself!!!: This author is the most unashamed self-serving person that is notorious on the Internet for all of his self-serving schemes. Five of the "reviews" that give this book "5 stars" come from the author himself. He goes by Max, Solomon, and other names. Solomon owns the sites Politicsforum.com, Authorzone.com, and Atheistworld.com. He may have also posted reviews of his own book using other names...which would have been the smart thing to do in the first place.If the author has absolutely no integrity and gives his own book five reviews with 5 stars to get people to buy it, why would you trust a book written by him to better understand a religion that has been under attack in recent years? Please, just ask yourself that question.
Ignorant scoundrel of an author: This book is simply one of Tulbure's cars for getting more money. He has left a wide wake across the Internet in mercilessly spamming both his books and his websites.Then he drops them like a watermelon and leaves the members with the bag.His books are sophomoric at best. His doctorate and educational credentials are a figment of his imagination, and HE CREATED HIS OWN FOLLOWING! People think Amazon members adore him, but his testimonials were by him, and his fans were him with out screen names.I've tried asking him what his credentials are on his various websites, and all that comes of it is a banning. He simply can't stand by what he says.I recommend that before you even THINK about buying this book that you do a Google search for "Solomon Tulbure" and press the "I'm feeling lucky" button. A plethora of information about this internet fraud can be found there.Be wary.
Rip Off: First off the software that I purchased from a rip-off computer store was not what was promised on the box. On the box it states that the software is compatible with Mac OS X and Windows. I installed the software on my computer which runs OS X 10.2. I see this crap is running some print shop suite (not the business card software)and the business card section is extremely minimal. The grahpics are so elementary and I will be complaining to the manufacturer ASAP. It's a shame to advertise falsely. I didn't get what I paid for at all. I ended up using some shareware and the cards look beautiful. Overlook this product. This company SUCKS
The worst software ever: I thought at first it was just me but after turning the software over to one of my co-workers who is exceptionally good at software, he even had an extremely difficult time trying to get it to work. And forget about getting someone on their support phone line, it won't happen. Save yourself money andforget this software.
Absolutely The Worst !: This program is waste of money. Works terrible, is clumsey and has few controls for any creativity. No support from the company. A very poorly written program. I will stay away from IMSI software altogether after this. This was a rip off.
I love Celine but don't waste your money on this cd: I must say that Celine is amazing and too many people make fun of her or say "Oh I hate her music." They evidently haven't listined to her newest work. Well, that said, I would recommend you don't buy this single because you already have two versions on the original CD and the Christian B version is really no different. I was sorely disappointed because I thought I was leaving the store with a dance remix (after I heard it in a dance club in San Diego).Not the case - I guess we'll have to wait for this.
Not enough energy for a pivotable time in Russian History: Mr. Brown takes the reader on a ride through a intense period of time, the 1917 Russian revolution. Even though Brown brings the key people to light (Lenin, Trotsky, Kerensky, etc.) he doesn't present the material in a fashion that keeps the reader wanting to read.
not what I hoped: I purchased these earrings to wear out to dinner a year ago but unfortunately have only worn them once. The first stone was much bigger than I expected, and instead of looking classy they look cheesy and fake.
Almost 30 years older...but not wiser: I read this wonderful book as an undergrad in the seventies. I found out about O'Neill from Stewart Brand's journal of the time, "The Coevolution Quarterly". O'Neill was the outer space guru of the age, just as John Lilly was the inner space pioneer. I assumed, as an enthusiastic youngster, that there would be millions of humans living at L5 by now. Unfortunately, we have a government run space program that, like any government bureaucracy, is inefficient and at the mercy of inferior minds (Congress and the White House). Nevertheless, this book is a good read and shows what one professor and a handful of grad students can come up with. For present day forward thinkers, review the ideas of Bill Stone (Stone Aerospace).
The Classic!: This is the classic proposal for the human expansion into space by the originator of the idea himself, Gerard O'neill. In it, he shows how space settlement could be done using boring 1970's technology.A very good and thought provoking read, it is the ONLY space book that presented a plausible way for the rest of us (not just the "experts" and scientists) could go move into space in style AND the only one to show a semi-convincing way to pay for it all (space-based solar power).

And!?!? So!?!?: If you like Pollack, Miro, and other abstract artists, you may like this. If you like learning about galleries and what motivates material artists generally, you may like this.However, many of us may think this art is a bunch of nothing. Many of us wonder how artists who put a lot into their work go unrecognized but this stuff does.In the same way that a Paul Mooney documentary implied that you're a fuddy-duddy if you don't appreciate his jokes, this work implies that you can't appreciate high-culture art if you don't like his work.But really, I just didn't care for what he presented. It seemed like the Emperor's Clothes in so many ways.I did love that this is a documentary that had foreign language subtitles.
Focus on what is really important in life: Family.: I found this book on my grandmother's shelf and couldn't put it down! The story is a great one, of the joy and happiness of family life and what blessings can come when we are serving those we love. I was inspired by this book and given a new determination to do what is really important in life: raise a good family and love them.

JUST WATCH OUT: AFTER 8 MONTHS OF OWNING THIS TV WITCH STARTED OUT TO BE A GOOD TV THE PICTURE WENT OUT SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER FACTORY WARNTEE 4 MONTHS LATER AND MANY PHONE CALLS TO THE COMPANY THE EXTENED WARNTEE TOOK OVER THEY DON'T HAVE PARTS FOR THEIR TVS SO IT COULDN'T BE FIXED AND YOU DON'T GET ALL YOUR MONEY ABACK IT ENDED UP COSTING $250. FOR A TV THAT DOSEN'T WORK SO GOOD LUCK WITH THIS TV YOU COULD BE GETTING TOOK
WARRNING: Don't buy a Syntax Olevia! I bought one and it died almost to the day the warranty went out. Customer service said I would have to pay to ship it back and pay the parts and labor to fix it and that would cost over half of the TV's cost. They wouldn't offer to help with anything and they said they lost my registration card, the same one they used to call me with to ask me how I liked it a week after I bought the TV. So all I can do is to post this to every blog I can to try to inform others.
Look for a different HDTV!: I purchased this HDTV and it worked OK for the first 10 days. After that I was unable to power the tv on or off using the remote or manually. Read that other Olevia models had experienced the same or similar issues. Called Olevia customer services to complain and was put on hold for at least 20 minutes. Save your money or put it to better use....buy a different HDTV!!!
Big bang for little bucks: I have had this model for 4 months now and am still thrilled. The system, while not cutting edge in the ever moving HD world, has performed better than I expected.I have it as the end of a small, inexpensive HD system, and the picture is amazing. I am getting a DVI to HDMI cable to increase the resolution even a bit more and have just bought a HD Optimizing DVD to tweak it even better.I highly reccomend this TV, especially in light of the price/value.
The paperback edition is almost unreadable: The paperback book used print on demand technology and is so full or errors that it is nearly unreadable. In one case a footnote that is spread out over the bottom of three pages in the original book is presented as a continuation of the text on each page. As a result, on these pages you are first reading text, then footnote, then the continuation of the text, then the next part of the footnote, etc. If you are hoping to do a close reading of these essays, you will need to find another option.
It helped got me a great job!!: I found this training course to be from the highest standard. I used all lessons within this bookset and I was able to finish my Microsoft Certification. And go on to a better job. Hopefully the Windows 98 will be as good.
The Photo is Right on Target: I like this piece, but I don't love it. The photo is very accurate. Both the peridot and amethyst stones are as deep in color as they appear. "In person", the peridot stones are a little deeper than I personally like. I like the style of this necklace and was hoping the peridot stones would be lighter than the photo....that amethyst drop stone in this necklace, is a thing of beauty! Peridot comes in many hues, some of the best quality peridot is very deep green, but it really isn't one of my favorites, however; it is my birthstone, so I like to wear it, sometimes. I have purchased three other pieces of peridot from Peora that I love. That said, it's a well made, quality necklace I will definitely wear. It's also, comfortable on the neck and stays in place.
Perspective is everything...: What a joyous, fun book! A book that can be read over and over, without losing it's humor or appeal, which is good, because I'd predict it's constant demand. George is such an affable character, and the pictures, well, just make you want to smile throught out. We love George at our house!
Great Poster - Ridiculous Shipping Charges: The Poster was $9.99. A little high for a 11x17" poster but so what. What got me was their shipping charges ALSO $9.99. The package arrived in a timely fashion but was packaged TWICE. The poster was rolled in a large heavy duty tube which would have been perfect for shipping if it had heavy duty shrink wrap. But NO. These people put THAT in a large Box that had room for about 8 Poster Rolls. Then they shipped it. I am sorry I forget the carrier but something tells me they are in on this together. The Poster rates 5 stars but the ridiculous shipping charges reduce my rating to 1.
Painless Algebra is cool: My son has had difficulties in doing his Algebra lessons and I can't help because I never understood math....this book made each Algebra equation easy enough for even me to understand....very good book.
Great book, but ...: This is undoubtedly a great book written in a simple manner and comprehensive language. But it lacks many important points. Especially, for someone who is clueless in algebra. For example, in the section Solving Equations the author explains very well what you have to do step by step to simplify the equations. But the author never mentions reodering the terms. Without doing it, a person may get completely lost when he is faced with a more challenging equation. I would still give this book a big credit! But it lacks important points.
What does letters have to do with MATH??: I am 41 yrs old and have only ever been taught Business Math. When my girls were young, I started to college part time but avoided Algebra b/c I knew I had no clue what it was. I stopped college, then just decided to go back and finish my degree. I knew I needed knowledge of Algebra. I went to our local Educational store and found this book as well as another to "cram" for placement testing. I have never used the other book. This book is so easy to read and understand. I'm no dummy, my GPA is 3.7 in college. However, I struggled with algebra. No more. I went through 3/4 of the book in 2 weeks and retained every bit of info I read. I recommend this book for the young and older. It is worth every penny! You will not be unhappy with this book.
Looks promising, but Kindle edition is riddled with errors: I received this as a gift, and unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to return a Kindle gift, or I would. On the surface, this looks like a wonderful tool for learning or brushing up on algebra, but DON'T GET THE CURRENT KINDLE VERSION! There are formatting errors that make several of the equations un-solvable. It looks as if the Kindle edition was formatted by someone who doesn't know algebra...symbols are missing, exponents are attached to the wrong variable...this sort of thing. As it is advertised, and indeed written as useful to beginners, this will likely lead to confusion and frustration.
Now I Get It!: Time to go back to college. Math was never my strongest subject. In fact it was my weakest. I had forgotten almost everything I learned in Algebra.I tried two books that claimed to make algebra a breeze. Promises. Promises.Then I bought PAINLESS ALGEBRA for a mere $8.95 and was pleased to find clear step by step explainations. Explanations that didn't require three readings before they made sense.I think the best way to approach the book is by reviewing the previous chapter before you begin a new chapter.A minor complaint: Too few exercises, as is the case with most of these types of books. But you can always find a workbook that will have problems for you to work out and the answers.Being mathematically challenged I recommend this book.
This book Is Really VERY good at teaching you algebra.: Ok, I have got to tell you up front that I have NEVER been a Math wiz, but after reading this book I can do algebra. I have never really gotten the hang of algebra. However I will be starting College in the fall, and I knew that if I was to have a chance of making it Past the first few weeks, I'd better Learn Algebra, and fast! So, I found this book, and I was sceptical, but after only 10 pages or so, I started to get a grasp of how Algebra Really works. Now I have read the book, and now I have a good understanding of how Algebra works. (I CAN DO IT NOW!) I would recomend this book to anyone struggling in algebra. However I must warn you This book does OVER simplify things in a few cases. Just don't get confused, or sidetracked. That is the only reason I could not give this book a 5 star rating.In conclusion this book works.
Concepts clearly presented but too many disconcerting errors.: The lay-out and range of topics are very attractive and useful for people who want to refresh their beginning algebra knowledge. However, in a quick read-through and working of about a third of the exercises, I found at least 5 errors in the text. Unfortunately, they were not obvious typos. Rather, they were errors that made me wonder whether I was mistaken in my understanding. As a mid-career, lateral-entry middle school math teacher who was already questioning her sanity, I lost a bit of sleep over some of these points until I could recheck my knowledge base in the morning.Maybe Barron's will do better with the 3rd edition.
It's Really Painless!: If you ever had to have a "mercy C" in math to graduate from high school, then, this book is for you. If just the thought of multiplying "x" by "3" and knowing what to do with that squiggly "x," the little numbers up by the top of the big number, or those weird fractions, don't wait another minute.Nothing, but nothing about school intimidated me like algebra. English, Literature, Science, etc., were a breeze for me. But math was so scary I simply couldn't decipher any of it."Painless" has changed all that, and when I finish this book, I'm going on to "Painless Geometry." (Which I have already ordered.)Oh. I'm almost seventy.
Painless Algebra: I am using this book to help my Special Education son understand his Pre-Algebra class. It has clarified the teaching process for me by putting everything in simple terms. It has been 40+ years since I was in an Algebra class, so it is great to have this tool to bring it all back in a concise way that I can explain to my son.
Painless Algebra: Lynette Long, does a great job of turning Alebra into a simple understanding subject, no big words, or terms. Easy reading, with problems to reinforce the uncomplecated terms.
Mistakes And Not-So-Painless Problems: I would like this book a lot more, except: There are mistakes. For example, when asked to graph the coordinate (-4, -2), you go to -4 on the x axis first, then down to -2 on the y axis. She had it backwards. If you don't know what you're doing, and you're taught incorrectly, how are you to learn?Also, she will present simple information and then give some difficult, and I dare say impossible, problems to solve. If I were learning multiplication, and the teacher threw in fractions, integers, and other things I hadn't learned, I would, of course, get lost. Then my confidence would suffer.I'm gleaning what I can from this book, but there must be far better ones out there. I don't recommend this.
Good refresher: This book is a good refresher, much like Cliff Notes. It could be a bit more explanatory in areas, but overall it is a great book to thumb through for the basics.
test problems not covered in tutorial part of lesson.: I've encountered problems with this book, a lot of the types test problems at the end of each lesson are much more complicated than the problems given as examples in the tutorial part of the lesson, and I'm having a difficult time trying to figure out the correct answer or how the creator of the book came to the answer given to some of the problems at the end of the chapter.
1st diagram I saw was incorrect: I am homeschooling my son, so I bought this book as a way to make Algebra easier for him. He's only in third grade, so I don't need it yet. However, I was explaining something to him regarding a calculation and wanted to see how the book would describe it. I thumbed thru the book and the first diagram I saw was on page 31. It was of the different number systems. It incorrectly showed that irrational numbers are a subset of rational numbers. I was a math major in college and know otherwise. Also, the book describes it otherwise. Because of this - the first thing I saw, now I'm questioning the whole series. Sad.
Memorize Shortcuts - Comprehend Nothing: The author reduces algebra to a bunch of simplistic formulas to memorize. While this may get a student through the test tomorrow it does nothing to further true mastery or comprehension of the material that will allow them to grow with mathematics or apply the material when presented differently than the author of this books presents it.The thought that this book was suggested by my son's pre-algebra teacher makes me nauseated.
BAD AFTER SALES SERVICE: I bought the AL2021MS in March 2006 and in November 2006 it started to malfunction (kept turning itself off). I called Acer support as it was still on Guarantee and was told they would replace it in 2 days. 3 days later I called them again and was abused by their help desk, told I had got it all wrong and that it would take 2-3 weeks. I am still waiting for a replacement screen. Apparently they are out of stock if it breaks under guarantee but will sell you a new one as they have enough stock to make a sale!How did I write this review: I am using my old 1999 15inch DELL monitor that still works.IF YOU WANT REALLY BAD AFTER SALES SERVICE AND A LCD SCREEN THAT ONLY WORKS FOR 6 MONTHS BUY ACER!!!!!
Marxists Participating in Capitalism: Neither the author, nor evidently the publisher, are in favor of free market Capitalism.In fact, both parties are communists who are against Capitalism, which they deem to be one with imperialism.Hence, the publisher should refrain from participating in the benefits of our system, which they are doing by selling this book for money.As communists, they should give the book away free, correct?Moreover, why all the restrictions on how to read the Kindle text?
Interesting look at a debacle: This is a superior narrative history of the fall of France in 1940. Horne examines the political and social changes in France following the end of WW I, and how these affected the French military and their ability to resist the German invasion in 1940. Horne examines the diplomatic and political attempts to resist, in addition to the ineffective military response by the French army and air force. Horne utilized an amazing number of sources and his narrative reads as a novel. I was completely absorbed by this book, and what I found particularly interesting was his examination of all aspects of the Maginot Line. I highly recommend this book, as well as his other work, The Price of Glory: Verdun, 1916.
a must if you love dogs: What a great book.It moved me to tears in some places and laughter in others.If you love dogs you`ll love this book.If you are looking for literature to share with your children,young and old,you`ll love this book.It is refreshing to read the english language as it is meant to be ,without any profanity.This book deals with real life issues of true importance in such a subtle gentle way.Issues of kindness,friendship,loyalty,generosity and spirit.I was left not with a sense of preaching or concrete ,right or wrong answers,but rather a sense of responsibility to my fellow man.Long after I read the book I found myself wondering how I line up in my treatment and judgement of those around me.One more thing,after reading the book you become very careful of what you say around your dog.
What dogs would say if they could write!: Linda Stubbs captures the personality of a West Highland white terrier without sounding silly or trite. The short chapters make for great bedtime reading, even by or to children. And Cody's encounters lend themselves nicely to family discussions about friendship, trust, and caring for the less fortunate. Cody's tale is imaginative, engaging, and lively -- fun reading for book and dog lovers of all ages.
Quite the Tail!!!! HaHa!!!: I must say, this was quite a bit better than the Bible......I can only hope that Linda Stubbs is working on a sequel to this amazing work. Some say John Steinbeck wasn't very deserving of his Nobel Prize for his literature, but Mrs. Stubbs, you leave no question as to who will be hoisting that trophy shorty....
A Fun Read!: This is a fun book! It made me laugh out loud, it made me cry. The dog never does anything that any ordinary dog wouldn't do, yet the author takes us right into the mind of the dog and gives us a viewpoint that most people don't think of. That's what makes it so funny - yet so real! I actually look at my dog differently now! The book is written in short sections which makes it easy to pick up for short periods of time. Of course, I didn't always want to put it down after a short period of time! I read it quickly because it was so enjoyable. I intend to read it aloud to my kids (age 6 and 7) next.
Attn: dog lovers: This is a tale of Cody, a smart little dog & all the people he meets & helps. It's a feel-good story but Cody is saved from being a canine Pollyanna by his spunk & hilarious view of humans through his dog's eyes. The story could be written for older children, but anyone who has ever loved a dog will enjoy this book. I can see it as a Disney movie. I rarely rate books 5 stars but this one deserves it.
Pricey: I tried them on at a shoe store and they were not comfortable enough to warrant the price. Expected more comfort for the price.
Very Uncomfortable: These things are about the most uncomfortable thing I have ever put om my feet. For the cost of therse things you can buy 2 pairs of Dockers.
Worth the price: I've worn Birkenstock sandals for years. When the time came to buy some new ones, I couldn't find the Birks that I like in my size. I bought some El-cheapo sandals at a chain shoe store, and after wearing them for just a couple of days, my feet were killing me. Needing something else, I decided to get my first pair of ECCO Yucatan sandals.Let me tell you, they are worth every penny. The arch support is amazing. The material used to make the treads doesn't slip, even on my back porch after it rains. The leather straps are first rate. My feet don't hurt, even after walking a mile on my neighborhood streets.I may ultimately go back to my hippy-style, slip on Birks, but for now, I love my ECCOs
Great sandal: I've been wearing the Ecco Yucatan sandal for over 4 years now and they continue to offer superb support and comfort. I get a new pair every year, as I really put them through the paces and they always hold up.
These are absolutely fabulous sandals: I practically live in sandals, wearing them outside for 3 seasons of the year, every day. These are exceptionally well made and extremely comfortable. I've walked many miles at a time, yet my feet don't hurt at all. These are actually more comfortable than my expensive pair of sneakers.
sandals: Very comfortable and durable sandal. Well constructed and very good quality.Took a few times to break the sandals in but once they were broken in they have been fine ever since.
No break in required: Great sandal, seems to fit most any casual occasion in Santa Barbara and just feels great the first time you put them on. Nothing 0 to even mention.
Don't skimp when it comes to your feet: Through the years, I have tried my share of sandals - absolutely nothing compares to Ecco - forget about the Tevas, Berks, etc... and even better, you can get them for half retail a lot on line. There is adequate arch support, and they are VERY durable. Could you find less expensive sandals? Sure, but they would not be as good for your feet, and they wouldn't last as long.
Ecco sandals: These Ecco Yucatan sandals are the best I've ever found. This is my second pair and I was pleased to find them available thru Amazon when they're growing scarcer in department stores. I have a bit of arthritis in my feet and these sandals are the only ones that I have found that are just as comfortable and good for my feet as the best available walking shoes. And the materials and workmanship are top notch. I can't recommend them too highly. They're more expensive but worth every penny.
Great sandals: I like everything about these sandals. I have bad feet and wanted something with arch support and these fit the bill. I would certainly buy them again.
Nice sandals: this is my third pair of these sandals and apparently I like them. I have problem feet and Ecco makes shoes and sandals which fit very well, although not perfect (have yet to wear perfect). Plus, even these leather sandals stand up very well to repeated salt water immersion Not generally a selling feature but great for me
Second pair of these sandals I've owned: I bought a pair originally while on vacation in Oahu. The sandals I was wearing at the time were killing my feet, so I happened by a mall and tried these on. Normally I don't pay anywhere near what I paid for these sandals, but after trying them out I decided to buy a pair. The original pair lasted almost 3 years while wearing them a few times a week. The second pair I got just in time for vacation to Belize, and though I wished I hadn't got them wet and sandy, they protected my diabetic feet from harm with better than average padding.
It's the only sandal my husband wears.: My husband's feet hurt all the time from sports injuries etc, Yucatan has the arch support and comfort he needs.This sandal is the only one he's worn for 10 years or so since he discovered it. He wears it walking even on the treadmill, since we live in Florida, sandals are our daily footwear.A few years ago ECCO had a demin color, like a navy blue, he would prefer that color.However, comfort first, color 2nd!
Replacement: My old ones were worn out and needed new ones.Best sandles I ever had so got new pair different color
Another great Ecco product: I own a quite a few of Ecco shoes and these sandals are probably the most comfortable pair of Ecco footwear I've tried on. But you may want to consider ordering a size up. I normally wear an 11 1/2 but when they arrived, my toes were almost at the edge and when I walk, they slide past the top. I ordered the 46's and will return the 45's. Overall wonderful comfort. There's no stitching or rough spots that rub against your feet. Great cushioning too. Buy these with confidence! But don't forget if you wear an 11 1/2, go with a 46. If you wear an 11, go with the 45 (and so on).
What a difference!!: I've been wearing a pair of Timberland sandals for years and have been very pleased with them. They were beginning to look pretty shabby and I decided to replace them. I mostly buy Ecco shoes because they're so comfortable and decided to give their sandals a try. I wasn't prepared for how comfortable these Ecco sandals are.If my Timberlands still looked good, I would have been perfectly happy wearing them for years to come. Now I'm actually glad they wore out because the Ecco sandals are in a class by themselves! You won't believe how comfortable a pair of sandals can be until you try on a pair of these.It's been mentioned several times here that they're expensive. Granted, they are, but as the old saying goes; 'you get what you pay for, and that has never had as much meaning to me as it did when I bought these sandals.
Comfortable sandle: Comfortable, well built sandal. Not sure what the difference is between ECCO USA Yucatan and the regular ECCO Yucatan which costs about twice as much.
Comfortable and sturdy: My wife has been raving about her Eccos for years and I finally decided to get a pair. I should've bought them years ago because she is right. These are the most comfortable and sturdy sandals I have ever had. I've been walking around in these for miles every day since I bought them and haven't had a rub point let alone a blister. I'm visiting San Miguel de Allende where the streets are all cobblestones and these sandals provide excellent stability and traction even in the rain. Highly recommended.
Excellent: I just received the ECCO Yucatan Sandal in the mail today. It has to be the most comfortable sandal I have ever owned. It has great arch support and the sole feels a lot like that of a running/cross training shoe. I actually found the sandal to be true to size and am glad that I did not go up another size...although I go from a 10 to a 10.5 and got the 10-10.5 sandal. People are also complaining that the front strap is not adjustable...well it is, but it only works to make it a little tighter on the toe...not looser. For me, it was perfect as I needed to adjust the front toe to be a little bit tighter. It feels like a sandal I could walk in for a long time.
very high quality: the ecco sandals are a very comfortable and high quality product, first time buying shoes on amazon, great experience.ECCO Men's Yucatan Sandal
Awsome: Whent camping with famley at Baxter State Park in Maine. Hiked some trailes in the area with my 8 month daughter on my back my feet never botherd me once. Sandals are awsome will buy them again when have to.
great shoe: This is the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. Worth the price. well made. I have worn similarly made shoes, but there is no comparison.
Who decided to make this a movie?: A lumbering read, alot of talk about the ground. Three characters, one is monosybolic, one is TOTALLY commited and the first person account whines all the time. He wants to hook-up with his cousin. Hmmm. A read to say you have read it.
Not so great...: This book was the equivalent of a 3D movie in the 1800's, meaning it had virtually no plot, but lots of visual effects. Jules Verne was exploring the scientific intrigue at the time, as science fiction became more popular. While some people like this kind of writing, I certainly didn't.
Not worth your money: Last year, our science teacher had us read this book when we were studying the Earth's interior. I eagerly went out and bought it, only to find that it was a dissappointment. My favorite thing to do is read, and in my entire life, this is the only book my parents have had to make me read. It was detailed, which is usually good, but add too much detail as Verne did in this novel and you begin to lose interest while waiting for something to happen. I wouldnt reccomend this to anyone.
Horrible: I hate this book with a passion. I had to read it for an English class and I absolutely hated it.
A fantastic book of adventure and philosophy: A wonderful read for those who love early science fiction by the classic authors. I read it with the enthusiasm of my youth, which made me feel young once again!
Great Jules Vern Story: How could I not give a Jules Vern story 5 stars. Very enjoyable as all his stories. A great read.
Always: Download all the great classics possible. They are usually free and can be a nice change to our current library.
Classic literature: MY son loves journey to the center of the earth, as well as most Verne in general, so this is a chance to sit and read to him.
Jules Verns greatest book: Adventure, suspense, bravery, sea monsters, underground caverns, unbearable heat these are just a few of the wonderful subjects this book has to offer. The story begins when Professor Hardwigg finds a very old book with a piece of parchment in it. On the parchment was a form of writing in some secret code. When the Professor and his nephew, Harry, discovered its meaning they were both shocked to find out it was the instructions for a journey no man thought possible, the journey to the center of the earth! Almost immediately they went on the journey picking up a man by the name of Hans to be there guide. There were many hard times in this adventure. For example, the Professor thought that they would find water in an abundance only to find that there was none till Hans made the discovery by drilling through a wall. Who knows how they will ever survive. I would give this book a very strong four out of five stars because of its ability to keep you wondering what is next.
Love it: Jules Verne is a great writer, transports me to places and makes me believe that they are posible to exist!
Bad Translation: After reading about half a dozen chapters I had to give it up because this translation just doesn't do Vern justice. This translation is more of a re-write, and sadly the translator can't write. Find a different version if you really want to read it.That being said, it's a great story and well worth the read if you can find the version by Penguin Books.
It's pretty good: It didn't blow my mind or anything, but I really respect how Verne always tries to explain the science behind his writing. It's a nice light read.
Awesome, descriptive, intriguing: I love Jules Verne! His descriptive, flowing style is fun to read. The "page-turner" books are the best.This is definitely one! It is interesting and entertaining.
Amazing book badly translated: This is a wonderful book by Jules Verne but this is just a terrible translation. Just read the first page of the preview and you will see. e.g. "Our good Martha could not but think she was very much behind-hand with the dinner" Is that even English? Seek out William Butcher's wonderful translation of this great story by Verne.
Not the same book as the original "Journey to the Centre of the Earth.": This is some sort of re-write, perhaps for American audiences? It's not nearly as good writing as the original. Get the original for free at [...]. The version I am reading was published in 1906.
I really liked this book!: This story is about a journey to the center of the earth through a volcano and inside of the center of the earth there are three people. They get down there without food or water or guns. Uncle and Harry are finding Arns Saknussemm's initials "A.S. and they are going up through a volcano in a hot hole and find gas pouring out. They shoot from the mouth of a cannon. They landed on a mountain slope. I like the book so much because of lots of adventures.
Classic: This is one of my favorite classic Jules Verne novels. I read this over and over again. Much better than the movies, although with the movies you have a visual component.
Great read: Must read for any geology day dreamer! although you can't let the little scientific inconsistencies bother you, and remember it's 19th century
Great classic novel: This is a great classic novel. It is a fun read and much better than the movies based on it. Give yourself a treat and read this book regardless of what you might have thought of the Hollywood versions.
tedious story, poorly narrated: Yea, yea, I know this one is a "classic". But sheesh, it's just not a good story imho. So much of it spent in the bickering between the professor and his nephew, and the "science" part of the science fiction really seems to be missing in most places. And I just flat out didn't like the reader for the audiobook. I go through a lot of audiobooks, and I consider this to be one of the worst I've listened to.
Confusing and uninteresting: The book Journey the the Centre of the Earth was not as good as I had expected it to be considering that the other novels that Jules Verne has written have been better. In my view, I would have to say that there was too much science terms and in doing so it made things extremely confusing. I would definetly never reccomend this book to anyone unless they really like science novels. I think that the book described things a little fully and at a point I was bored. I only found about three pages that actually engrossed me into the book. There was a beginning middle and an end but the middle was very long. There was no lesson learned in the story therefore not alot of meaning. It seemed as if the book just went on and on.
ending was a dissapointment: I'm a dissapointed ten year old rating this book. Up until the end itWas probably one of the best books I've ever read. It was full of adventure and excitement, but then I got to the end. The book did not live up to it's name. It would be more appropriately called "Journey Almost to the Centre of the Earth. I recommend this book only to people who like major dissapointments.
I love everything about volcanoes!: As a person living in a country with about 130 active volcanoes, I like the story about them. I myself like to have a journey to the crater of a volcano. One of the exciting story about volcanoes is this book. Though it is somewhat surealistic, Jules Verne was able to present a life-like story that is able to draw the readers' minds, as if as they were in the story themselves. Through his words, we can feel the beauty of the scenery in Iceland, the suspense and thrill of the characters' adventure, the imagination of the living creatures inside the earth, and the joy of the characters after their success in 'go down to the centre of the earth and back in three pieces (the Professor, Harry, and Hans)'. After all, this book is pleasant to read, especially if you like an adventure story!
Btw lol asap GET THIS BOOK: JULES VERNE BOOKS ARE AWESOME WHEN I READ THEM IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M REALLY THERE EVEN THE MOVIES
books: no much comments, classic fiction novel. help me understand more in my literature class but I do not remember where I put it now...
how ifeel about this book: this was the first book i bought using my kindle and i am happy to say the i made a fine choice by buying this book. it made me feel like i would want to do that for a job.
Enjoyable: Over the decades, I have read "Journey ..." a few times. Despite the years since it was written, it holds up quite well as a fantasy / Adventure! It is an enjoyable book and I think today's teenagers would like it.
A classic of nineteenth century French literature: This is one of Verne's best works. The characters wonderfully believable and the plot is absolutely brilliant. Okay, so you're not going to find many people that believe in the hollow earth theory these days, but who cares? It's easy to suspend your beliefs and just get caught up in the story. Admittedly, the discourses on geology can drag a little for some readers, while others may find it part of the 19th charm, it all comes down to preference. Personally, I love the 19th century "info dumps" it's an insight into how people saw the world at that time. Verne had a reputation for writing fast paced adventures full of unexpected twists and turns and Journey to the Centre of the Earth is no exception.
Is this really what you want!?: One problem about ordering books on-line, is that you only have as much or as little imformation as the seller gives you. I was looking for a decent hard back copy of Journey to the Center of the Earth. This seemed to be what I was looking for. However, what the seller does not tell you, and something you can't see in the photo, is that this is a Barnes and Noble "Children's Classic." I don't think it is unreasonable to expect that this type of relevant information is included in the description. On top of it all, the particular seller I used listed the book as "New", which it clearly was not.
cool book!: The Great Illustrated classics are great (no pun intended) Journey To The Center Of The Earth is so cool. I love this book. on a scale from 1 to 10 I give it an 11. You can't put it down. I like the pic's they were made very good. This book is so cool. and if you like the word hot then this book is so hot. This book is good for all ages. I love it and you will too. Get it and injoy it. READ IT!
Booooooring.: A business that has been around for centuries, had their hands in everything, and even owned the Roman empire for a brief time period!!! It just doesn't get any better than that, this book could have been very, very exciting. Instead it is one of the slowest books I have ever read.When the "action" does begin in the last two chapters...you really don't care one way or the other, nor do you understand the majority of the problem, because it has been so poorly developed.Bought this book for $1 at the bargain bargain table at my local book store hoping for a gem. I figured it was just so cheap because it was by a British author and no Americans knew his work. Anyway, I was wrong...it was just $1 because it was incredibly boring.I don't reccommend this book...however, if you would like to read it...I've got one that I'll sell you for $1.50. :-)ukmatt78@aol.com
Bland...check his other titles instead.: Without simply regurgitating what other reviews have said, for me it basically comes down to this: the book was boring. Sure, there can be slow parts for pacing of a storyline but the "slow part" lasted through the first half or more.I REALLY like this author, but check the classic Wasp Factory or Song of Stone...those books are engaging and interesting.
Lousy: I found this book to be far too predictable and, to be honest, quite boring. Though Mr. Banks is undoudtedly a fine writer, it seems as though he 'phoned it in' on this outing. At times it feels as if the story is heading in the right direction -particularly near the end - but then it hits a brick wall. I found the ending of the story very bland. What happened to Kathryn? What about Hazleton? All in all, a let down.
Disappointing.: I am an avid fan of all of Iain Banks' work but this book I found to be a big letdown. At times I had to force myself to keep reading because unfortunately the plot wasn't enough to retain my interest for the duration. The only reason I read it in it's entirety was because Iain Banks wrote it and I am too big a fan to give up. The base idea was fine but I got the impression that this was a book only in the draft stage ergo released before it's potential was reached.
This is a good book!: The story is entertaining. The commentary is alternately scathing and profound. There's a salient and relevant lesson in the end. You should read this.
Where's the reaL ending?: What happened here iain - did you get board or just loose the plot?Have to say I realy like this guys work (for the most part), but this book has so much promise, but just completely fails to deliver. It's as if the author got bored of the story and decided to most end it ASAP.Not is best by a long shot!
Audiobook version is superb!: I read this book when it came out, and liked it well enough. However, I just "read" it again via the unabridged audio version narrated by Barbara Rosenblat, and it really came to life. A lot of the book is told through dialogue, and her skilled portrayal of the many character voices brought out the humor and finally the humanity of the main characters especially well. The plot does meander a bit, but the reward is worth your patience. Fans of audiobooks should make an effort to track down this version.
Do not buy this to replace your VHS tape versions ...: I had been looking forward to a DVD version of the Red Skelton TV specials, yet I'm disappointed that these are the shortened (edited for commercial & announcement time) versions which have several sections of each program removed, making them about 15 mins. shorter than the full (live performance) VHS tape releases. The quality of the video is acceptable, however, and is well worth getting if you don't already own the VHS tapes of the TV specials ... (just can't understand why the publisher didn't put the full versions in the collection ... probably cheaper this way ...)
The War of the Worlds: I was somewhat let down when completing The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells. The way Wells wrote in Old English, required me to often reread the text to fully understand the concept. Secondly, I was surprised how limited the number of fighting situations there were compared to action films that I've previously seen. Instead, there was a lot of hiding and survival situations. I think Well's writing style showed that he was very specific during the first few chapters as he described the setting and characters. However, Wells did not necessarily allow more of the characters to develop, thus decresing the interest of Wells's writing. In conclusion, I would only recommend this novel to a reader who enjoys Old English writing and has fun with Wells's style.
Not my favorite read: Gee, I know its a "classic" but I could't wait to be done with this book. I was completely put-off and annoyed by the writers "backwards" description of events. Hard for me to describe here, but as events were unfolding, writer describes them after-the-fact... I dunno, just not to my liking I guess
Doesn't have vocab info in Kindle version: I picked up the kindle version when it was offered for free and it doesn't have the SAT words in bold with the definitions on the next page. I looked at the preview for the paperback version and the kindle version is not the same. I also could not find the footnotes.
Did not read so don't know: Didn't read deleted shortly after downloading. Just wanted to try out a 'kindle' book on the iPad and the resolution is so awful I removed it and the kindle app promptly. They (kindle books) are no where near as nice, clean, crisp as iBooks :( Kindle books might be ok for some people that are ok reading fuzzy blurry words with terrible graphics, but I'm already spoiled on the brilliance and crisp clear resolution of the iBooks and Kindle books feel like your going back 10yrs in technology every time you look at one on the screen. If your an iPad owner, don't bother, if you want this book find it on iBooks.
This is a Sci-Fi story written by one of the greatest masters of the genre!: This book is over 115 years old and yet the technology and the invasion by an alien race is almost prophetic in its very nature. It is a wonderfully written story told by one of the masters of Sci-Fi whose visions of the future were amazing.The story of the invasion is eerily realistic and describes how an invading race of aliens who cannot tolerate our atmosphere and gravity use advanced technology to crawl out of there craters they have created and take on the military might of England.I don't want to spoil this very good story but I recommend to you that you read it for yourself and enjoy it. The book is worth reading and it is entertaining. One of the messages I got was that mankind, who thought themselves to be superior to all of the earth's creatures were at the total mercy of the alien invading force. The aliens were indeed brought down to defeat by the lowliest life forms on earth.A great story, even 115 years late

Always loved this book: I was very pleased to find this book listed among the freebies on your websites. Had this book as a child and enjoyed re-reading it again. H.G. Wells novel should a must read to all you sci-fi fans out there.
Almost Perfect!: This book was great! I would absolutley recommend this book to you. I couldn't stop reading it! It was really cool the way the martians came in capsules. H.G. Wells did an excellent job writing this book. It really made me think. It was action-packed the whole way through. However, there were quite a few hard words. It is a good book, but not the best. Sci-fi fans, you'll definately want to check this one out.
JUST ENJOY A FANTASTIC STORY: I have read a number of reviews that seem to deal with the "underlying reasons" or "metaphors" that Mr Wells was using as a framework for this story..I first read it as a child and have read it many times since..Forget the movies (both of them) forget any "secret" meanings or "social lessons" that are to be "learned" within these pages and just enjoy another work of imagination by Mr. Wells..One of my favorite scenes is when the story teller is trapped within a partially collapsed house with the Curate..(interesting how both movies dealt with this scene)..Certainly there are lessons that can be learned or imagined in a great number of books, but this one has way to much going for it in the way of excitement.. Just let the story carry you into another time and place--just enjoy a FANTASTIC story..an easy Five stars from me..
Reading with Tequila: Sadly, I just couldn't get into The War of the Worlds. It dragged from word one. It was short and didn't take a long time to read, but it seemed like forever. I've been recently coming to appreciate some alien stories, but this one fell flat. The ending struck me as an easy way to end the novel and left me feeling unfulfilled.
The War of the Worlds: H. G. Wells's book "The War of the Worlds" has been interpreted by many people like Steven Spielberg, Byron Haskin, and Orson Welles. I have seen and heard all of them, but there is nothing that can prepare you for this book. I would recommendthis book to any sci-fi lover.This book takes place on the island of Great Britain. It is in the 1890s when few cars existed and most travel is done by train or horse and buggy. So in the story the main character is an astronomer who saw some kind of jet of gas on Mars. Later you find that it was a gun that shot pods with Martians in them. The Martians looked like gigantic heads on three little legs. They didn't eat what they did was inject human blood into them. They used machines to distory the humans.I realy like this and I think you would too.
Classic sci-fi at its best: This was a great book. I've seen the old movie and heard the radio version, but the book is much better. Anyone who claims that it is a bad book because it is 'boring' or because it takes place in England is a fool. The book was written 50 years before we even thought of exploring outer space. Now that's good...
It has obviously stood the test of time. An excellent story: The first time I heard it on audio casette,I was astounded and since then I have re-listened to it dozens of times. Well worth buying as a casette or a book.
I could not put it down.: The book cover itself deserves 5 stars. If i could ever get to read it again it would be today.The book got me an A+ on my report.
Free SF Reader: Humans are not alone in the universe, let alone in the solar system itself. Large tripod-like machines land, and they are most definitelynot friendly. It is discovered that they are from Mars, information which is not particularly useful. With advanced weaponry and materialsthey set about a mission of destruction and conquest.In the end, it appears that the biological sciences were not their strong suit, bringing about their downfall.
H.G. at his best: I like H.G. Wells' science fiction works (most of his other work was just nonsense). This is the best of the best, I think. If you like this novel try to get a copy of Sherlock Holmes's War of the Worlds (by Manly Wade Wellman and Wade Wellman). It tells about Sherlock Holmes's adventures during the Martian invasion and the authors have tried to stay loyal to H.G.'s tale.
entertaining even after all these years.: Book was so great. I got it free which makes it even better. It's hard at times to follow, but it's worth the trouble
Oddly Prophetic: Written near the dawn of the 20th Century, Wells captured much of the troubled new century's essence. No, we weren't invaded by Martians, but we did use exotic new technologies similar to the ones used by the aliens in the book to kill each other in record numbers, which is actually much scarier than Wells' imaginative scenario.
Like you've never read it before: I've always loved the movie version of this book so when our school library obtained a copy I immediately began to read it. I find it a truly wonderful story of a "doomed" Earth trying to fight off a very advanced race of Martians. None of their weapons or means will work. The Martains are unstopable,... or are they?
Decent text - sub-par images: I bought this book primarily for the Correa illustrations that are included in the book. The illustrations in the book are reasonable reproductions but are definetly not as good as I was hoping for. If you're buying this book for the illustrations be aware they are about the quality you would find in a 1950s text book.If anyone knows of any other places to get decent reproductions of the Correa images please let me know.
Science Fiction Fun: The War of the Worlds is the best of Wells' science fiction. Not only does it create a frightening vision of what might happen if an advanced society were to invade earth (though this "vision" was more political satire than anything and continues to have relevance in today's world), but it is well written (not true of all Wells' works) and contains very real human drama that by itself is an engaging story. Though it came alive on the big screen and I occassionally had a hard time picturing the Martians and some of the details of the story without seeing Spielberg's version, this is certainly worth reading for all science fiction fans or people who want a little background when they watch the film.
Review: I haven't had time to review the book yet but looking at some of recipe was interesting. I can't wait until I do get the time to read it.
O.k but way to out dated: O.k this book was written at the begging 0f 1900's but it's wat to outdated. The characters are not fun to read they are very boring and not that much happends through out the whole book till the end. the ending is maybe the best part of the book becouse all the action happends. At times the book states some good questions like if there is life out there. the book was the first of it's kind which is why it's a classic.
This book is HORRIBLE: I have recentely been assigned this novel as and English project in school. If this grade did not make up 25% of my quarterly grade...I would not be writing this review now. If you have not begun to read this book now, DO NOT...may I repeat, DO NOT read this wretched book. As for my star rating, I would have given this book half a star if this was an option on the review page. Ciao
Sensationalist drivel for the masses: This book was boring and depressing at the same time. A shallow plot that is supposed to bring fear but fails completely. This book might have been good when it first came out decades ago, but it fails to grab attention now. As a plus, it probably broke new ground in science fiction literature at the time, but this matters very little to me personally. I read this book as it was part of the Masterpieces of Science Fiction Collection from Easton Press, and I did not want to throw down $40-$50 on a title I did not enjoy or value thoroughly. Instead, for this genre, I recommend Orson Scott Card's "Ender's Game", "Dune", by Frank Herbert, "Stranger in a Strange Land", by Heinlein, or "Flowers for Algernon", by Daniel Keyes.
The War of the Worlds: This book was ok.... Not my favorite of all books. For one the style of writing, for two i thought it was kind of dumb. But anyway... I chose it cause i thought it was interesting and I had heard about the radio show by Orson Welles, so I wanted to read it. I was really disappointed. It is about martians who pretty much try to take over the world. I would not recommend this book to anyone except those who like weird fantasy and Old English writing. Sorry this isn't a good review.
Boring: I had to read this book over the summer for school. Since I love fantasy, I chose books that were fantasy or science fiction. I adored The Hobbit which was fantasy, but found The War of the Worlds to be too much science fiction for me. Even though it was a short book, I found myself constantly counting how many pages I had left to read. It was extremely boring. Normally I find reading fun and invigorating, but reading this book was like a chore. It had a good plot, but had too many events leading up to the climax and too many leading to the resolution.
Fantastic, terrifying, intelligent, thoughtful, REAL!: Not bad for 1892! A defining book, and in my top three faves. I first read this when I was twelve, and I have not been without a dog-eared copy since. The images it conjurs in the mind are terrifying, walking through the English countryside I often imagine those giant, pitiless war machines, striding over smashed artilery, burnt out houses, and men and horses suffocated by the unbeatable black smoke.I thought this book would be better received. I'm glad the book is not set in the US as although it is a great place to set a story in, we English need our own Apocalypse. The book is far from dull, and Well's narates it like a documentary, making you believe that it has actually happened. Do not hesitate, buy it. I cannot be sure that you will like it, but it is worth the risk for a book that could haunt your mind for the rest of your life. Uuulah!
The original alien invasion masterpiece: This is the original alien invasion classic. I love the way H. G. Wells writes. His style flows well and I found that I was able to become totally immersed in the story. Wells keeps his stories short and sweet, my kind of reading!I also recommend the musical version:Jeff Wayne's Musical Version Of The War Of The Worlds
Much more than I expected: Upon completing this book, I was amazed that this was published when it was (1898?). I was expecting a sugar-coated portrayal of Martians invading England - "Oh, I say, we're under attack!", or some such nonsense. What I got was a very enjoyable book that didn't pull any punches when depicting the chaos, destruction, and death that results from this invasion. His portrayal of the Martians and their technology beats anything that I've read in contemporary science fiction.The only problem I had with the book was Wells' narrative. The story provides far too much detail at points, giving exact times and locations for minor events which I'd think someone who survived a disaster would have a hard time recollecting. With the overwhelming number of locations for events presented to the reader, you'll need a map of the London area in order to stay on top of things.Additionally, Asimov's afterword is very insightful, and the cover by Roger Dean is great.
ggreat book: Was looking for a version a little shorter for my son to read, and other versions were too long, so he felt discouraged. This was perfect!
Classic: The book is exactly as I remember it. Still scares the beejeebers out of me. Can't beat the price, either.
Come on!: First of all, this book should NOT have been set in the USA. There are far too many books set here anyway. Give the author a break, if he wants to write something set in the country he knows something about, let him do that. He's been dead for quite a while here, and it would be sacrilege to "update" this book, and americanize it. It makes me sick to watch the entire US population think the rest of the world should be just like them. As for the person who said that he didn't like this book, and rarely read anything, well that's your problem. Of course you aren't going to be able to read a classic and understand it if you only read at a 1st grade level! But overall, this is a good book, well-written and a fantastic read.
Alien invasion!: I recommend this book to someone who is interested in aliens. This is a very exciting book with aliens attacking Earth. It is a bit long with many difficult words, but if you like aliens, it is worth it!
Great: I had not read this book since I was 17 (59 now), and it was great to revisit this classic after so many years on Amazon's Kindle. You also cannot beat the price: free. I plan to buy some other old classics for my Kindle.Amazon and its products are very high-quality across the board, and, no, I do not work for Amazon or own any of its stock; I simply appreciate the company's customer-focus.
A Terrifying Story: Wells is a master storyteller. He is good at developing a thick plot and providing you with enough information to suck you into the story. While his futuristic depictions are dated, his themes are not. His style is very cinematographic - he describes the actions frame by frame filling in the details of what stands in the foreground, background, and the sides. It's not unique but he's one of the best at it. If you are in for a quality story, check this one!
Wells wrote one heck of a book: Wells wrote a great story that has been redone so many times now. It wasn't written in the 50's as many people might think. It was actually written in the 1890's. And Wells creates a story about Alien Invasion that is so scary and well put together. It has Martian's coming to corral the humans. And the humans at first have no way to beat them. They keep getting beat and it almost seems as if we are going to be killed at any moment only for the humans to come out on top. A great Victorian style novel that stands the test of time (a la Independence Day). Though this book is ten times better than Independence Day. A great sci-fi book that will forever be the blueprint for Alien Invasion novels or movies.
Spectacular...simply amazing!!!: The war of the Wolrds, written by H,G. Wells, was one of the best books I have ever read. No other book I've read has said so much detail in a way that still made the story enjoyable and not completely boring. Reading the book, I felt as if I was with the narrator and with him through all the action. The story's plot is intricate and compelling with no pauses or dull moments. I rarely wanted to put the book down becuase I always wanted to know what would happen next. Many times, when the suspense was at its pinacle, I would have to sit at the edge of my seat. This is an amazing book written by a genius author. This is one of the greatest martian books of all time. I defenently recomend this to all who read this resoponse. If you are into alians and sci-fi stories, I garuntee you will not be disappointed.
Great Series, Not-so-great segment: This audiobook by Winifred Phillips left me disappointed. My enthusiasm for "The Masque of the Read Death" left me hoping for far more of "War of the Worlds". I'd recommend purchasing the musical version of "War of the Worlds" instead.
The World Full of Wars: This book is a mix of science fiction and drama.The author also plays the role of the main character.The action starts in the second chapter when a large cylinder falls from outer space.An astronomer who is also the narrator happens to be in the right place at the right time.He watches the first cylinder fall and while he is inspecting it he discovers some sort of life.At this time the action begins.He's basically stuck roaming to and fro trying to dodge the mysterious aliens.This story is very suspensful and at times difficult to follow.However I did enjoy reading it.

It was Okay.: The book was okay if you like incredibly boring details. If he (the author) would have put in a little more action, it might be a 3 or 4 star book. Otherwise, it was okay, although a little farfetched.
The book wasn't too exciting but it was interesting: I finished reading the book last week and to tell the truth, I was glad to be done with it. I didn't find the book appealing at all. It was boring and kind of graphic at some points. I recommend this book for people who are into the sci-fi type of books.
overrated: i was really excited to read this book but ended up being really disappointed. i don't understand what everyone else sees in it. it wasn't very exciting at all and i really don't think h.g. wells was that great of a writer. it was really a pain to have to get through (so it was good that it's short) but was somewhat entertaining at times.
I read 10 pgs. into the book and thought it was BORING!: I had high expectations for this book but found it horribly boring as did many other people I gave the book to . None of us were able to finish it for fear of falling a sleep.
I thought the book was boring: I didn't think H.G. Wells put her best work in this book. No doubt about it he's a great writer and all; i just don't think this was her best work. What i do complement him on though, is how this book in stores. Think about it this book is 101 years old. So all-in-all i really didn't like it, but, some people might have another opnion and we ahev to respect that.
Dull and boring. Don't waste your time!: This book may be a classic, but it is a chore to read. Very little happens in the way of action or character development. The plot is well known thanks to the famous radio broadcast and movie adaptation. You'd think the book would give you some insight as to the characters or a more involved plot line. Well it doesn't. This book may be one of the first ever Science Fiction novels written, but first does not equal best. Especially in this case. Do yourself a favor and read something a little more current. If you are looking for a good Science Fiction classic, check out "Dune" or "John Carter of Mars".
How did he go wrong?: Dull, dull, dull. Yes. I am talking about the novel The War of the Worlds about an alien invasion from Mars. And it's boring! So very, very boring. Wells writes like a passionless, uncaring observer, so when the Martians start roasting us, who really cares? I sure don't. Call me gauche, but I would rather read a sf book that was entertaining, than this so called "classic" that bored the daylights out of me.
War of the Snores!!!!!: Overall War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells, was a horrible book and unless your fasinated with old English, I recomend you do not touch the book. It is also extremely BORING and the one exiting part in the book lasts one page! There fore War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells is a good way to destroy a saturday afternoon or decimate your free time.
This book was Terrible: This book was the worst book i ever read I had read The Invisible Man and hated that also but I heard from people that H.G. Wells was a good author so i said i would give him another chance. What a waste of time. Both these books were terrible i would reccomend them to anyone they were the worst books i ever read and it was a waste of time
Sorry: Sorry to rate such a famous book with 1 star... I got the Kindle edition but i'm gonna post the review here since i'm reviewing the content. I'll try to keep this short. Unless you're attracted to this novel for some reason or you have to read it, i wouldn't recommend it for random reading. I might be too accustomed to a cinematic style, fast action, intriguing stuff, but there is simply too much description in this novel, not written in the most recent English :) I kind of feel disappointed that in such a huge sci-fi mythos it seems like sci-fi action was only a pretext in the originating book.
Not enough action: I personally thought this book was horrible. It was very boring and not once was I on the edge of my seat. I was never excited to keep on reading. The only thing that I liked about this book was how H.G. Wells described the Martians. I think he did a very good job at that but besides that the book needs a lot more action that will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next.
Boring: I had to read it for IS AT practice and it was not good at all I chose the rating since it was boring
so-so: This book is very nicely written, but it just didn't catch me. I usually an read a book in 2-3 days, but this one didn't really get my attention, and it took me 5 days(Actually I was halfway through, and I gave up on it)to read it. I might have been reading a different version of it, but I'm pretty sure it was this book, because on this website I 'looked inside this book,' and it started out the same way. I personally think this book isn't as good as I thought it would be.
Surpisingly Fresh and New: I though I knew this story. I had heard the radio show and seen the movie - so I was just planning to read a classic in the original words but wasn't expecting anything new or interesting in the content. I was very surprised. Setting this back in Victorian Times when it was originally written totally changes the story. The speed at which the disaster is communicated is different. The speed at which the participants can flee from the Martians is different. The tools that the humans can bring to bear against the Martian invaders is different. All of these things make the story surprisingly new. I really enjoyed it.
A new sci-fi reader...: I am not a sci fi reader but I was making a point to read genres I would normally pass over. Afer reading this book I will clearly start browsing the Sci-fi section. This book was vividly written and full of emotion. I will definitely read another H.G. Wells book.
A classic read!: I've wanted to read this for years! This book is quite a classic, definitely worth taking the time to read.
Could not get into book: I just could not get into this book . It was to hard for me to read or want to think about after I read it.
Yawn: Interminable. Perhaps in his day, Wells' writing would have seemed interesting, but today...All that happens in the book is the narrator scurrying from town to town without direction or purpose. He hardly even describes anything or anyone, so it's impossible to connect with any of the characters. And what he says of the Martians, which arguably are the only interesting things in this book, is fleeting and vague.No character development, no plot, no real conflict, no motivations. Damned waste of time, really.
Lacks plot!: The author, H. C. Wells, takes one of the most interesting concepts and creates one of the most boring books imaginable. The book is short on worthwhile ideas. Yet, it exhibits an abundance of long, runaway sentences. I found myself hoping that H. C. Wells might, at some point in the story, start to exhibit some of the interesting flare of his later counterpart ... Orson Wells.
how cool... NOT!!!!!: My 6th grade "advanced" class read this. EVERY SINGLE PERSON HATED IT!! do not read it. in some parts, it is soooo long because of unnesscery details, and then he doesn't gives enough detail in other parts. the book was like a very long sentence. hg wells may be one of the best writers in history, but not in my book! martians invade, martians take over, somehow, the martians are not defeated by fighting, they are defeated by a bacteria! HEY! DING DONG THE MARTIANS ARE DEAD! THEY'VE GONE WHERE THE GOBLINS GO! BELOW! BELOW! BELOW! NOT! do not read this book. maybe the martians could have beamed down here and taken hg wells!!
war of the worlds: it was not want what i wanted . it was not the hole book it was only the first half. so you would have to buy the other half to find out how it ended that is not right.
This book was'nt any good if you like roles: Some time in the past. There was a war that raged in two worlds. Villages and towns were destroyed by akueb foot soldiers. These people were either captured or killed. The lucky ones fled out of the area of fire or even some of them formed rebel armies. For thousands of years this war raged, people died. Also alien technology grew even more deadly until they devised a heat ray to destroy the remaining villages. A lot of people died at the hands of the aliens. Many of them were lucky to escape from the heat ray's range. Those who were captured were never seen or heard of again. The survivors created legends about them.
it deserves one thumb up !: this book was okay but extended too long so it got boring at times. it should have been in the U.S. It should have considered making it in NewYork. Then it could have been more exiting. Then we could have understood it much better because most of the words were in british. It would have been a lot better. they should make a remake of it in a english background. they should also update the book.
It made no sence at all .: I am not the best reader in the world , and I hardly ever pick up a book , read , and relax , but it doesn't take a scientist to figure out Wells was on medication when he wrote this. I'm even a big science fiction fan , but this book was to odd to like. I am even one of the biggest fans of the hit T.V. show "The X-Files". To even understand a little of this book , I had to go over everything just I already red. It was the worst book I've ever laid eyes apon.
It's not a *novel*: This is not a novel. The people in it aren't even characters; they're archetypes, with no names (The Policeman, The Laborer, that sort of thing). Think of The Canterbury Tales; it's like that. It's more like a medieval morality play than an actual story.And, frankly, the moral it's trying to drive home is pretty dated by this point. Yes, it's possible for even the greatest nation to be toppled when it hits an Out Of Context Problem. But that's been driven home repeatedly over the past couple of centuries--most recently on 11 Sep. 2001. If you really want to read on this theme, pick some more recent author.
The War of the Worlds: The War of the Worlds is a science fiction novel and I didn't think it was very interesting. It is about a couple in London, England in the late 1900's. This couple was always interested in the stars and the sky, so when they saw red beams of light they got suspicious. So when people said that a flying suacer had crashed they were not suprised. The Martians started to invade the Earth as soon as the saucer landed. During the fighting this couple got split up. The main conflict is that he tries to fing his wife. I didn't like this book very much because there was not much action. The story would have been better if it was more exciting. I would recommend this book to 14 year olds and over, but more to kids who like science fiction.
The War of the World: I was very dissapointed after reading the book, "The War of the Worlds," and found that it did not meet my expectations considering all the publicity (other people's reviews). A lot of chapters were very repitive if the fact that half of the time the book just talked about him wandering around. In addition there were too many references to Old English towns that made the book extremely confusing. Also I couldn't tell if the main character's brother survived or where he went. I was also displeased by the fact that the main character was merely an observer to the martian's defeat and the fact that his only real accomplishment was just surviving and didn't do anything to stop the martians.
The War of the Worlds: Not only was this story as good as I remember as a child, but the quality of the paper an print images was great. The paper book cover is now of much better material than I ever remember. I truly relived the summer and the many places I sat down and read this story over and over again. Thanks very much.
Great Book: Very Classic Book and should be read before seeing the movie as it provides a totally unique story. HG Wells is the man.
The best WotW version: With apologies to Orson Wells, George Pal and Steven Speilberg, the Classics Illustrated version of H.G. Wells' "The War of the Worlds" was, is, and ever will be the best visual version of this classic book. The artwork by Lou Cameron is simply superb and Harry Miller's written adaptation faithfully captures the book without sacraficing any of the action. Although some may consider the appearnce of the tripods to be a bit dated by today's standards (they resemble Cold War era tank turrets mounted on water tower legs with vacuum cleaner hoses for "arms") they still retain a menacing appearance within the context of the story. The story itself thankfully remains grounded in the late 19th century when Wells wrote it. A pity that Speilberg decided to ruin the story by making it about a dysfunctional 21st century family. The image on the cover of the tripods attacking a World War I era artillery crew is not just classic; it's poetic.
A classic: It's war of the worlds. It's legible. There are an array of nifty appendices in the back. What more could you want?
I loved it, and you will too! :): This book pulled me in right away. It was so indulging and interesting. I also enjoyed many of H.G. Wells's other books: The time machine, Island of Doctor Moreau, the invisible man. All great books. you must read them NOW!!
One of the classics that started it all: Along with "The Time Machine" this is one of those classics that helped shape the future of the science fiction genre, and is therefore worth the read. I have to warn you however that those who are used to a more contemporary writing style might find this book a bit slow. But if you enjoy classics, then this is one worth having in your library. The first of all the alien invasion stories.
One good Book the one and only: Pretty good I also watched the movie the movie is pretty awesome love the movie so bad I want to watch it again
War of the Worlds: The original book was far better than the recent movie. It made for easy, simple reading, and was very enjoyable.
satisfying: I eat a Clif Bar every morning for breakfast before I exercise. They stop the cravings and fuel me for the duration of my work out. Good balance of protein to carbs with no refined sugar and NO corn syrup. Lots of added vitamins and minerals make it a great meal replacement also when I'm too busy to eat a meal. My favorite flavor is the chocolate almond fudge--it's chocolately enough without being sickly sweet. Perfect!
great flavor of a great brand: This flavor really impressed me because I don't normally like nuts in my foods. I like that Clif Bars doesn't make their product overly sweet and leaving you with the feeling that your teeth are probably rotting as you chew. I often eat this bar with an apple or banana at breakfast or lunch and have plenty of energy for hours. It really fills you up, but not that bloated full that you get after having a burger with fries.
This batch was bad: I had ordered this previously for my daughter who absolutely loved it. The next time I ordered it it was off flavored and tangy. My daughter wouldn't eat it and I donated it to the food bank
Glue too stiff: Most of the glue in the tube was very stiff, had to remove from tube and mix with small amount of water before applying.
valuable diet supplement: This is a great additive to your diet for a supplement. I add it to my smoothies in the morning and am off and running, it helps with getting nutrients and allows to aid in loss of tummy fat.
Will not buy again!: This product will not stay in place no matter what! Slides right down the leg. I tried several ways of keeping it in place. Save your money.
Very nice game: I find this game just right for my 7 year old boy. Is not too hard nor too easy for him. Color and sounds are great.
Not fun if you don't like bad graphics: I didn't really like this game because it had bad graphics and it didn't really relate to the story. If you really want to buy thisfor someone make sure they are old enough to know what to do because I'm 11 and I'm really good at video games and I thought it was pretty hard.
Very nice quality and great value: True, these studs are large and I was a little surprised when I opened the box and saw them for the first time because I didn't expect them to be so large, but I decided to keep them because they are very pretty. Despite the larger than average size, they have a beautiful color, faceting and setting. If you like a large stud, you will love!
Keep the Band Name: Even though Mike Viola's name has been taken off the marquee, this so-called group remains a vehicle for his songs, singing, and sonic ideas. And this time he has come up with a much more solid and consistent piece of work than his/their last album. Still rejoicing that the British invaded us back in the Sixties and several times since, Viola has put together a satisfying mix of up-tempo rockers and particularly strong ballads. Viola's hook-laden ditties are filled with clever word play and presented in his attractively raspy voice. There are still a couple of tracks that don't try hard enough and a couple that try too hard, but there's enough good stuff here to make us go back and re-evaluate that first album.
Home video: I would rate this video very poorly. It is more like a home video and not a very good one. Amateur footage, lack of information, and zero excitement.
Joo Donato as Great a Master as Jobim: Simply put, Joo Donato is one of the Bossa Nova masters as a composer and as an original pianist -no more or no lesser than Jobim. This is a piano-bass-drums trio program with Eloir on drums. Donato's original and master command on piano is the featured item on this CD. Highly recommendable.
Review John Adams: Product was advertised with jacket covers for each book. See Picture. Books came without jacket covers. They appeared to be old library books with there library designation painted on the outside of book.
Louis' 2nd-best story collection- still good readin'!: L'Amour's best story collection was 1975's WAR PARTY, but this 1980 follow-up has some great moments as well.Most of all I want to comment on the story "Bluff Creek Station," a powerful re-write of an earlier pulp story called "The Blood of Ryan." I believe this story is one of L'Amour's finest moments, right up there with FLINT, REILLY'S LUCK, THE DAYBREAKERS, and the story "The Gift of Cochise" (collected in WAR PARTY.) It is the story of a stagecoach stationmaster's last moments of life. Unforgettable. It is alone worth whatever you pay for this book-- my favorite western short story next to O.Henry's "Pimienta Pancakes."All in all, a great anthology. Buy it.
Not what I expected.: Perhaps I should have read the description better, but these DVDs aren't what I expected. I expected to recieve DVDs containing the entire Spurs playoff series, instead these DVDs merely provide highlights of the Championship series. Good material, but not what I was looking for.
The best Chocolate Ever: I first saw these in Dubai. It was the best Chocolate I ever had. I bought a bunch to bring home but didn't have a whole lot of luck finding it here in the States. Then I saw this on Amazon. I ordered it as a surprise for my husband. It's a little pricey but worth every dime.
Ancestors of deliverance: What a striking novel. Heard of it from childhood and finally read it. As Laughable as it seemed, there were people very much like the one's in the story. Go deep south in the 40's or 50's and you would have seen them. They were there. They may still be there, or one's like them. Behind all the things that are funny to us lays dire hoplesness,selfishness, ignorance, and failure. But the main idea to the plot is they really didn't know or care. Their lives went on till they died and that was that. Again what a story.
funny and bizarre: in the hills before the beverly hillbillies there were hillbillies. this book tells the story of the mountain folk. there was a movie made in about 1940 based on this book. the movie is hard to find, but closely follows the book one of the characters, dude, or dudeboy, as his father called him was the inspiration for the cartoon character: dewdboy, a modern day, half baked character..that follows in the tradition.. although now employed as a forklift driver for a toiletpaper factory, a lofty position in the day of his ancestors. Great book, I hope the movie is also released soon.
My Mother Made Me Read This: When I was young, and still ashamed of being a Southerner, my mother made me read this book. She told me it would enlighten me as to stereotypes believed about Southerners by people from other regions. I thought she was out of her mind, until a woman from Toledo told me, "Oh, your Southern accent is so *cute*, so _Tobacco Road_!" I sat bolt upright and shot back, icily, "No, madam, it is most certainly NOT _Tobacco Road_, and had you read it, you would understand WHY." This was the 1980's, I was eighteen, and had graduated from high school the week before...and it was in that moment that I realized how little others know about Southerners. It's not great literature, and certainly not the best of its genre, but I think all Southerners should read it in order to grasp the way outsiders see us.
AWESOME: TOBACCO ROAD WAS A REAL EYE OPENER. SOMETIMES IT IS EASY TO FORGET THAT WE ARE THE MOST SPOILED GENERATION THAT HAS EVER LIVED. ESPECIALLY HERE IN AMERICA WE REALLY TAKE THINGS FOR GRANTED. IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE NOT KNOWING WHERE YOUR NEXT MEAL IS COMING FROM. THIS BOOK REALLY MADE ME SEE WHAT MY PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WERE TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY TOLD STORIES OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION.
Tobacco Road: I'm not easily offended, but found Tobacco Road obscene. Not for the sex, for the protrayal of poor, white Southerners without compassion, or, in my opinion, any real understanding. Is making the same joke about physical deformities again and again and again satire or even good dark comedy? Not in my book. In well-drawn humor we are able to see our own wekanesses reflected and recognize the human link between ourselves and the most foolish. But Caldwell's characters are so devoid of humanity that poking fun of them just seems juvenile and cruel. Additionally, I found whole passages of the book poorly written and repetitious. I confess to being a Southerner and from poor stock and perhaps that colors my view. But I love Faulkner and O'Conner. I think Caldwell is best forgotten.
My best friend: What a great book, you can read it in an hourThe behavior of lazy people has not changed since when this book was written, I gave it to a lifelong friend who is living on his farm & acting just like Jeter
Disappointed: I am intrigued with the depression era and the people - the description of this book made me think the story would give insight to what people thought and felt during that period. This story was about people who were not right in the head.
As discribed: The book arrived ahead of schedule. It is in excelent shape. I was expecting a little more wear so I was pleasantly surprised.
It was good.: Not the greatest book I've ever read, but a good read with a satisfying conclusion.It did justice of how things were during that time period.
Tobacco Road by Erskine Caldwell: I chose this book because I had heard about it and knew that it was written a long time ago. I am not sure that I will even finish reading it as it is difficult ;to read and repetitive in many areas in the first 4 chapters that I have completed. As I read further I may change my mind, but have reservations.
Doom, Despair, and Agony on Me: For a condescending view of rural poverty and a heapin' helpin' of good old-fashioned god-fearing racism, "Tobacco Road" is unrivaled. By all rights, the Nobel Prize should indeed have been awarded to Erskine Caldwell - and to the scriptwriters for "The Beverly Hillbillies" and "Hee-Haw".The most redeeming feature of this picaresque novel is its brevity. You can easily finish it at one sitting, take a shower, and appreciate the fact that you will never have to read it again.
Southerners.: A touching, moving drama about the perseverance of the human spirit and the brotherhood of man. Not!Are Southerners fated to be so self destructive? Read "The Jungle" instead - there's something more sypathetic about people who actually try, but fail than about people who fail because they don't even try.
older book: a 1947 version of the book was sent with very brown pages and a cracked binding. i do appreciate the date of thebook, but the condition was misrepresented.
Tabacco Road: I would like to have my money returned for this book I purchased. I could not read it. It is trashy.I tried to read it, however, I never got past 20 pagesMaybe I can have a credit for this book ?Let me know, please.I thank you. I am enjoying my Kindle very much.I read classics. ..and read authors, such as, Henry James' The American.Thank You,sincerely,Iris Bird.
One star is generous in this case.: This book is perhaps the most disgusting display of blatant prejudice I have ever witnessed in a work of fiction. I don't believe Mr. Caldwell could possibly have interacted on any personal level with any of the people whom he so cruelly and stereotypically portrays. As a resident of the South, I have had literally thousands of narratives of the Great Depression passed down to me through family and friends. None ever reflected anything in the realm of this book. "Tobacco Road" reflects a view that poverty equals inhumanity, and this could not be farther from the truth. As social parody this book is almost entertaining--but taken as seriously as the tone of the writing encourages, it is ludicrous.
Tobacco Road hits too close to home.: Tobacco Road is an important, if not uplifting story that should have broad appeal. Being from the rural south, I struggle with the image stereotypical poor southerner, but, the Lesters make for a compelling composite of the worst elements of southern poverty. Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth" makes for a compelling comparison and contrast to "Tobacco Road". Personally, I prefer "The Good Earth".
I'VE GOT A GIRLFRIEND THAT'S BETTER THAN THAT!: O! my. So many allusions and so little point. And despite its surface sheen and highly affected, postmod technical slips this film will undoubtedly be found as but a paragraph in the still early chapters of the 1,000 Volume Edition of "Style: Its Grinding Victories Against Substance". Go with "The Third Man" instead...
The Bad German: What a disappointment this movie was...from the gratuitous sex scene with Spiderman to the perjured Casablanca type ending. Almost made me sick. Worst World War II movie I ever saw. This had such potential and they really blew it.
Nice to look at, but that's the only good thing I can say about it...: It's beautifully filmed. Cate Blanchette in B&W;, filmed in profile, is classic. Aside from that, the film is a horror. Wooden acting. One-dimensional characters. Boring and predictable plot. Utterly unbelievable story (Jewish woman married to S.S. man and NOT sent to the camps?! Uh-huh... Whatever...). Toby Macguire trying to be threatening is just toooo comical, as are the numerous scenes where George Clooney gets the heck beaten out of him.As someone fascinated by the era in which this film is ostensibly set, I was too disappointed for words by how rotten this movie was. You'd think that a story like this would have at least a little bit of emotional impact, or would be somewhat interesting, or would maybe at worst be suspenseful fluff, but this movie really had nothing to recommend it except for being pretty to look at. It might be better as an art exibit, viewed with the sound turned off, purely for visual effect.
Cheap Imitation of Classic war/noir movies: This is one of the worst post world war II noir movies I have ever seen. It is a cheap imitation of the classics such as Casablanca or Judgement at Neuorenberg. Apart from Kate Blanchate, all the major actors especially George Clooney did a very inferior and non convincing job portraing the key character. The theme of this film as with the majority of todays Hollywood movies is a message of anti-US sentiment. Furhtermore the director of this movie did a very poor job of the interplay between real post war Germany film footage and the actual movie itself.
The Bad Idea: They must have thought this was great in the studio producers' suite when they saw the bleached, scratchy, black and white film and the big name 'stars' hamming it up for all they're worth in a 'film noir' wartime thriller. Another artistic intelligent classic, eh, guys... one for the Oscars!But when you watch it and you realise the only thing going for this dreary and stultifyingly dull slice of old tat IS the grainy black and white film, you know you're in deep trouble. Mind, chances are you'll be fast asleep long before you give up caring what's going on, i.e. after about 10 minutes.Get Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid with Steve Martin instead - at least that's REALLY clever AND funny, and you have some fun watching the big screen stars of yesteryear grafted into it with some genuine style and panache.
A huge disappointment.: The worst screenplay adapted from a novel I have ever seen. The plot clarity and witty dialogue from the book are completely missing. The murder of an American soldier that the book and movie center around is committed by a different character in the movie than in the book, and much less plausibly so. A Jewish (minor) character in the book has identified other Jews to the Nazis to save her own neck. In the movie, this collaboration is confessed by the heroine, which is totally out of character. In the book the Nazi rocket scientist goes to American with his wife at the end; in the movie his is killed. And Lena, the heroine, who in the book is a conflicted and sympathetic character, turns out in the movie to be capable of murder and collaboration. I rated the book 4 and the movie 1.
The Book Was Much Better: I loved the black and white format of this film, but found the acting wooden and the plot tired. The book was much better. This film, albeit an interesting and creative technical piece, sorely lacked the nuance and brilliance of the book. One star for effort and one star for the black-and-white.
A Real Stinker: Steven Soderbergh unfortunately is a hit, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss director. Kafka still remains, to this day, my favorite of his films and it is not even on DVD.This film was terrible.Awful.
A decent film.: I was relieved to know Toby Maguire's whiny tough guy character wasn't going to be through the whole film. That has to be one of the worst mis-castings I've seen in a long while!Clooney and Blanchett are really good, but the plot twists are too predictable in following the WWII film noir structure. There was no "punch" in the script.
Poor Adaptation: Soderburgh's attempt at noir failed and seemed more like an excuse to use footage from war-ravaged Berlin than a real embrace of the genre. Soderburgh's noir attempt also fell flat because there was too much unneceessary violence and voyeristic embrace of the bizarre (the legless Jew who had been experimented on, but suddenly is running a shop in Berlin a few months after surviving a concentration camp?) whereas genuine noir is understated. Noir aside, the real problem with this film is a disastrous screenplay. The novel's rich texture of minor characters (and even major figures like Gunter) disappear and, as has been mentioned other reviews, Lena's character is completely transformed and ruined. The "surprise" at the end of the film was a poor attempt of making a profound statement about morality and survival in the Third Reich.
adjustment on the lighting anyone?: read the novel. it was ok. saw the movie. got the director's intention. but some big problems. blanchett as dietrich/garbo. not a good idea. she's great, just poorly directed. too bad. clooney? he'll do. the problem is he is not a facially or emotionally conveying, expressive ennough actor to pull off a 'presentational' acting performance. he just comes across as moving stone. the soundtrack, at least on the dvd, is defective: dialouge is barely audible, have to raise the volume, then the music screams out. total imbalance and really irritating. my worst gripe is the lighting. sorry. it's all washed out. loved the black and white choice. obvious in this instance, but film noir did not wash out faces to the extent they are walking lightbulbs against a sheet of black construction paper. so who did the cinematography? i'm not in the film business, but the choices were right, just poorly executed. too bad. this kind of film, on paper, is what i dream of as a moviegoe

Not like the book: On what planet did they make this movie? It is so different from the book, e.g. Lena and Renate are combined into one character which completely changes Lena's relationship with Jake. I thought the book was an excellent read and was so looking forward to seeing it as a movie -- total disappointment! And when George Clooney isn't getting beat up, he looks jowly and worn-out. If you liked the book, don't bother with the movie!
disappointed: The one thing I would have liked to know before purchasing this movie was the use of the "f" word, plus the plot was thin. I was disappointed in this movie for the simple fact of the language and find this word to be soooo offensive. I also find this to be a juvenilistic approach to making a movie. Can't the actors act without using this kind of language. If they had wanted to make a movie in the old style maybe they should have paid attention to some of the old movies. I just watched "Twelve O'Clock High" with Gregory Peck which was great and no offensive language, the actors and the plot stood on their own.
Not the book!: The movie was very disappointing to someone who read the book. The author created a very important message that was diffused by the movie.
The Reviews Here are Longer than the Movie: And i don't know which is worse? Beautifully filmed is about all i can say. its a goofy film and i was glad when i saw the wordsThe End. If you're really bored? Rent it. Don't waste your money on this one.
Looks nice. Can't remember much about the plot...: They all look nice in b/w. But why is this movie so unmemorable? Maybe because I just could not bring myself to care about the story or the characters. I really can't recommend it except for the set design and photography.
Weak script and terrible faux-noir cinematography: Classic film noir has a crisp, high-contrast look. "The Good German" has gauzy, soft-focus cinematography that would be more appropriate in a perfume commercial. The mushy images and consistently overexposed highlights make the film hard on the eyes and a chore to watch.The poor cinematography might be tolerable if the script were worthwhile. Unfortunately, the script is even worse than the photography. The story plods from one uninteresting plot point to another with no sense of momentum. The acting is nothing special, either -- not that anyone could save such an ugly, badly written film.The obvious comparison is to Jacques Tourneur's "Berlin Express," a 1948 noir set in post-war Berlin. Tourneur's film is one of his weaker efforts, but it's a minor masterpiece compared to Soderbergh's failed pseudo-noir.
Find a better German...any German...this isn't it: Other reviewers amplify the film noir, historical accuracy of post-war Berlin, Soderbergh's artistic interpretation...enough. It's been done before and done better, Not even Clooney's charm and wisecracks can save this. As any good American will understand, this one's a huge swing and a miss. Don't let your curiosity get the better of you. Take a pass.
BEWARE THESE ARE CASSETTE TAPES NOT CDS!: It says "audio CDs" but what I received are cassette tapes. Stand by while I try to get my money back from the seller. Amazon does NOT make it easy to contact these 3rd party sellers, so far I can't find a link to pull up any contact info but I will find it by god!
This Is Ridiculous: Seriously. Listen to "Someday" and "How You Remind Me" at exactly the same time. They are almost the EXACT same song!! Try it for yourself, I urge you.
America's Sweetheart writes a book of profound truths: This book tells you everything you need to know regarding how to live your life - and it tells it in such a friendly and charming, non-threatening way that even if you do not begin immediatley to practice the ideas Mary sents forth, it will make you feel good just having read it. And to think that it is written by a famous movie star and Douglas Fairbanks' wife is all the more reason to be amazed by the wisdom and great thoughts that are set down so clearly and simply in this small little book
Save your money: One of the most poorly written books I've ever read. Dispite the serious subject matter, I found myself laughing aloud at the tortured prose, stilted dialogue and ridiculous non sequiturs -- not to mention the many grammatical errors. This lady needs an editor!
Save Your Time And Your Dime: This has to be the WORST "true crime" book that I have ever written. While giving credit to Lisa McVey and Susan Replogle (victims of the book's subject), this piece of work is nothing but disguised effort to toot the horn of the book's primary author, and actual writer, Joy Wellman.Many of the ingredients typical of a true crime were missing from this book; such as details regarding trials, the investigation, many other victims, etc. The reader is provided pretty indepth detail about two victims, general information is provided about others, but some victims are mentioned only in passing. The remainder of the book focuses on the author and co-authors friendship, their desire to teach women to speak out against sexual crimes committed against them, and their lives following Bobby Joe Long, the convicted. And it for this reason that this book should be listed in the biography section versus the true crime category.
Just AWFUL writing!: I was interested in the facts, but this book just rambles on and on and reads like a poorly-written soap opera. I will never finish it; what a waste of time.
Inspiring bravery: This book takes you on a rollercoaster ride of feelings and emotions. Anger,nausea,pity,anddisgust. The women in this book give detailed insight into their hellish encounters with a serial killer, and then are further violated by our court system. This story should empower all victims of crime to demand judicial change.
Good Effort, Poor Execution: It was a good effort. The storyline did have an unexpected twist at the end which redeemed this travesty of literature in my eyes. However the editing was non-existent, the characters were one-dimensional and unbelievable. (A woman as strong as Cynthia is portrayed would not stay in a domestic violence situation for 10 years.) There were numerous syntax errors which were very distracting and kept me from taking the book too seriously. The use of the different fonts was also distracting. An artist paints a picture and lets the viewer interpret for themselves what it means. A viewer of a fine painting tries describing what the painting is telling them. The author spent too much time spelling things out and not enough time painting her verbal picture, letting the reader explore the emotions invoked on Cynthia's roller-coaster ride for themselves.
Good history of the people: This is a good introduction to Appalachian history and culture. I liked the mix of interviews with a mix of entertainers, authors, politicians, and academics.
Appalachians: Exaxctly what I ordered. I watched the series on public broadcasting and I wanted a copy. Found it cheaper on Amazon than ordering direct from public broadcasting.
The Appalachians: This is a must see! First of all it's beautiful, secondly the story of the area is extremely well written and the assembled cast authentic and articulate. Lastly - the music. The sound track alone is worth the series.
Historical Appalachians: I really enjoyed learning more about the Appalachians. The DVD's were insightful as well as entertaining revealing the rich history of the area, of how it became settled to present day existence. It also displays mankind's greed and how the area was plundered for its natural wealth and how we mistreat our own people all for money. I am going to enjoy watching these DVD's again and again.
Good luck getting one undamaged.: You're better off to pick these up from your like home improvement store for less money. There's a Hampton Bay just like it at the depot.
Good Product: Good product. We couldn't find one the color that we wanted, so we bought this one and painted it. It came out great.
I don't really hate it but is just that is not the one I wanted and I would like to exchange it. having a little problem .: I was saying I would like to exchange it having problem with that can get enyone to help. Change it to the one I really like to have.
"HOGAN KNOWS" -- THIS BOOK IS A WINNER!!!: I'll be honest, I don't like fiction books. But I've got to tell you, A Mulligan for Bobby Jobe has changed my mind. Mr. Cullen adds so much detail that the reader comes away with a sense of actually being in touch with the cast of limited characters and the events taking place. The twists and unpredictable turns make the book a truly unforgettable experience. You don't need to be a golfer or a fan of golf to enjoy this novel. Can lightning strike twice? Absolutely!
Are these reviewers as blind as Bobby Jobe?: I mean, come on. A blind golfer? I thought it was an intruiging premise, too, until I tried to hit balls with my eyes closed. I'm a 2-handicapper, and I was completely hapless. So forgive me if my suspension of disbelief came crashing down.That said, Cullen writes a pleasant, if completely farfetched tale, with likeable characters. However, I thought the best parts of the book had nothing to do with golf. The subplot involving the mentally ill father was actually more interesting, believable and touching, and the best part of the book was a short bit about Allegheny men and their pickup trucks.
Heart and Soul: I highly recommend this yoga DVD to everyone. Dr. Morell brings a great deal of experience and insight into this yoga program. She has a great introduction where she explains how this yoga program will help and she even has real testimonials at the end of the tape with women who have practiced her fertility yoga program and were either pregnant or had a baby. It really is inspirational. The practice itself has a great flow with many poses, most have variations so that anyone (experienced and novice) can practice. Her narration brings me through step-by-step yet I feel empowered like it is my own practice. This is a grass roots type of DVD. It seems to be made more from the heart than anything. How else could she have so much insight into what I needed? I liked it a great deal because it made me feel comfortable, and I truly saw some results in just a short time. Oh and did I mention the background music? It is right on point.
Don't Waste your money: I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I have been practising Yoga for 8 years and so I have some idea of a good yoga session. The instructors voice is extremely annoying, there isn't a flow to the class and it is way too fast. She has you moving from sitting to standing to laying, absolutely no flow. She doesn't even join in on most of the movements and the other participants on the tape are obviously struggling to keep up. The dvd appears to have been filmed by an novice, so the quality is poor.I believe she has used the Fertility title to entice people into buying, don't be fooled as I was. If you are looking for a yoga tape for fertility, I would personally recommend Yoga 4 Fertility, which has been professionally recorded, the instructors voice is soothing and clear, the session flows together at a slow comfortable pace. You actually feel that you have benefited from it.
Not For Beginners ....: Some women might really enjoy this DVD; however, I was not one of them. I've been practicing yoga for about three months by taking some classes and using the AM/PM tapes successfully every day. This tape required balance and flexibility that I just don't have. In addition, Monica Morell is big on stretches for the "thyroid" which means a lot of back and neck bending. These did very little for me and actually made me feel sick. As I said, some folks might really love this tape; it just wasn't for me.
One of My Favorite Times of the Day...: is the 50 minutes I spend doing Fertility Yoga!! I LOVE FERTILITY YOGA!!! I am no "yoga pro" (I have had very limited exposure to yoga poses), but I enjoy this DVD so much!!The modifications allow you to slowly ease into the more difficult positions...and trust me--regardless of your flexibility, after a little practice you will be able to do the harder poses!Monica's voice paired with the peaceful music is very soothing, and I have found that this DVD has also helped me to relax before going to bed.Let's face it, whether you are facing the stresses of Assisted Reproduction (like me) or just trying to conceive naturally--it's tough to stay positive...and sometimes you just need a little "Me Time'. Fertility Yoga has helped me to unwind and loosen up during this trying time!!!
unsatisfactory: I expected a longer video with much more variety of poses,but the video was not satisfactory.It is just an ordinary yoga session
A trap for desperate women?: The video seems home-made. It's is hard to trust its content if the quality is so amateur. I would like to have my money back.
Least Favorite Fertility Aid: I have been practicing yoga for over 10 years. I started with classes, which I now take maybe one per year, and currently work with tapes. Most of these poses were beyond beginner (such as 'Threading the Needle', which can be dangerous for people with previous neck injuries) and didn't offer much in the way of attainable modifications.The production is amateurish at best and the yoga model looking into the camera is greatly distracting. The models were obviously people from her classes and not professional instructors as you can see them struggle with the poses as well as breathing.I recommend that you will better spend your money on 'Yoga 4 Fertility' with Brenda Strong. Her voice is soothing and her instruction is very thorough.Best of Luck!Krista J. Essler, LAc
Easy work ... with Monica Morell: The exercises are not so easy but she make it easy, her explications are excellents, and she propose also differents positions if you have difficult to do someone. Really you feel different since begin, but you find everything is necesary to love you, feel you and wait the spirit baby is around you to come to our family. I'm very happy and satisfaction feeling, is the most i was expected. Thanks Monica.
This DVD really made a difference...: Monica's yoga program has really impacted my life on many levels: physicially, emotionally, and (surprisingly) professionally. Since commencing this program, my stress level (including my blood pressure) has dropped exponentially, and I actually feel more at peace with myself. I have also noticed that I have been better able to manage the stressful issues that inevitably arise in my law practice since I began yoga. Monica's yoga program has significantly contributed to my overall health and well-being and I am confident anyone would benefit therefrom, just as I have.
The WORST Yoga DVD ever!!!!: Like another reviewer said this is really a trap for desperate women. She was clever to name it "Fertility Yoga" because otherwise she would not have sold a single copy!! Her voice is annoying and her cueing is awful. There is nothing calming about this and come on she uses "Crack open your chest" for chest opening instruction, and "Snoring with your mouth closed" is not the best explaination of Ujayi breath!! There was nothing in this DVD that would make it specifically beneficial for fertility as opposed to other Yoga DVDs. You would be much better off with Barbara Benagh's "Yoga for Stress Relief". At least she is a quality instructor and the DVD is well made. Don't waste your money on this one! All those positive reviews must have been from friends of hers. Oh Yeah, at one point I think she actually burped while she was talking.
dave r.: without question t. rex's best effort. this is the place to start for new fans. i grew up listening to this almost daily and can't understand how anyone would consider their music collection complete withot a copy of this disc.important stuff.
The sound of Bolan: T.Rex did not enjoy as much success in america as they did in britain. Electric warrior stands as the one album that put their name on the US map. Songs like "bang-a-gong" and "Jeepster" were both US hits. The album contains much more than that, for example, the rhythmic groove of "mambo sun" sho off Mickey Finns frantic bongo style. The album is a perfect mix of the elements that make T.rex one of the most influential Rock Bands of the 70's.
Rhino gets it right!!!: I bought no less than 5 versions of this album on CD and FINALLY the definitive version is here. This version puts all previous attempts to shame. If you bought the 30th anniversary version that came out recently sell it and get this. None of the flaws have been repeated here. This version has complete ORIGINAL ARTWORK plus many beautiful PHOTOS, LYRICS, a POSTER plus ALL the SINGLES and B-SIDES from that period. It sounds amazing and the packaging is a collector's dream. The only thing wrong with this edition is the fact that I had to wait so long for it. THANK YOU RHINO!
Influential Classic: The most amazing thing about listening to this in 2003 is you can clearly hear the influence this has had on artists after it was released: David Bowie basically re-created this album's vibe verbatim while cranking the guitars a bit more on "Ziggy Stardust." The vocals and arrangements on "Electric Warrior" are also dead ringers for several songs from "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." Tell me Tim Curry's Dr. Frankenfurter doesn't sound (and look) like Marc Bolan!I really enjoy the guitar sound on this record too. Unlike the album cover with Bolan posing in front of a towering amp stack, the guitar sounds like it was plugged directly into the mixing board, giving it a uniquely understated distortion, and allowing all the strings, congas, background vocals and a beautifully dense bassline equal time in the spotlight of this landmark disc.
Not that great: I think this album's pretty weak. Most of the songs start out great but then don't go anywhere. They just end.. Like "Once upon a time, there was a mean knight and a good knight. The mean was mean and the good was good, oh yeah...THE END" After listening to it four five times the music got pretty bland and boring. I gave it a second listen after seeing all these marvelous reviews but it didn't get any better. If you like hearing bridgeless music that doesn't really mean anything buy this album. I don't think I get it yet.
Disappointed: After hearing 20th Century Boy, I decided to check out T. Rex. I was familiar with the band from their only song on the radio, Bang a Gong. After seeing all the 5 star reviews, and the title "Electric Warrior", I figured this CD would rock. It didn't. The only song that rocks is Bang a Gong, which I have heard a hundred times on the radio. The rest of the songs are slow and boring. I was expecting a cd with at least half rocking songs like 20th Century Boy, but this only has 1 out of 17! I can't believe how high this cd is rated. If you are looking for a good rock cd, look elsewhere.
are you kidding me!!: Im not an angry person bashing any old music. Im a musician bashing this bullfunk. Seriously, with all the good reviews on this page, they must be hopped up on cocaine. Im a huge 1970's fan myself and this is out of control. Please spare your self the $40.00 or 17.00 and buy something else. Like good blues if your into blues. Cause this is irritating. Peace out you crack fiends
Bolan rocks!: This is classic; favorite make-out music from the 70's. Remastered, the C.D. concludes with an excellent interview between Marc Bolan and a radio disc jockey.
This album is killer!: The songwriting on this C.D. is simply exquisite. Marc Bolan's T.Rex sounds so fresh and energetic and raw. The music definitely shines today and fits with today's music. He was grossly underestimated in the states in the 70's. The song,"Cosmic Dancer' is haunting because he says "I danced myself into the tomb, Is it strange to die so soon?" As you probably know Marc always felt he'd die in a car crash before he was thirty and he did in 1977. His guitar work is at his best during this period. "Girl" is gorgeous and"Lean Woman blues' is a blues rocker. This is, in my opinion is tied with "Slider" as the two best T.Rex records or C.D's.
Can't imagine life without T-Rex: T-Rex fills a certain niche that can't be replicated. They are a little hippy-dippy with a heavy measure of glam rock. I think of them as 'summer music'; I always listen to them in the summer especially. This is the album with 'bang a gong' on it; their most famous song. Every song is a great donation to rock-n-roll history.
Not as good as SACD 2003 version: This is an awesome album, however, the remaster job is not as good as SACD version. Even CD layer doesn't have that punch. Try finding out the SACD version. You won't be dissapointed.
Good record: First of all, the title of the album, the cover of the album, and song titles totally contradict what is contained on this album. With songs names like "Monolith" and "Planet Queen" and "Bang A Gong (Get It On)" coupled with the cover of a guitar player in front of a giant stack of amplifiers, you'd think this would be a sonic assault on your ears. Nothing could be farther from the truth. In fact this is a VERY mellow album. Myself only being familiar with a few of T-Rex's more upbeat hits and in my 30's, I decided to pick it up. I was very surprised and somehwat disappointed in what I found. I wanted more of a straight up rocking record, but no dice. It's definitely a good record, very cohesive, nice flow, inspired the glam rock movement, but nowhere near what I was expecting. Unless you are a big fan of 70's prog rock or are looking for something to just lay around and chill out to, avoid this record.
Tastes Change: I remembered liking this album in the early 70s when it was released, so I bought the CD. Tastes change, including mine.
Uh one.. Uh Two... Uh.. Buckle my shoe!: Buckle my shoe indeed... Fire up your tube gear and put this bad boy on the turntable! I have had the vinyl version of this record since it first came out. I originally listened to it on a very basic tube system. Fast forward 40(!) years and here I am queing it up again on a nicer, more modern tube system. I don't have the CD version of this record (it is now in my cart).When I first heard my original vinyl copy of Electric Warrior again I just about fell out of my chair! The T Rex sound is like no other and the production is outstanding. This music has a very timeless quality and sounds as fresh today as when it first came out. There are many well-known big name groups from this era that you can't quite say that about. Any of the first three T Rex albums have this sound to them so get one or all three. "Electric Warrior" is a great place to start. I especially, highly recommend the vinyl editions.
Not a Suitable "Anniversary Edition": As much as I love the music of Marc Bolan, I was very disappointed with this release. As the previous reviewer mentioned, there's nothing going for this album: no original album design, no lyrics, and poor reproduction. In a way, it does spoil the album for me. With the "30th Anniversary Edition" one would expect to see a wonderfully packaged tribute to a great album; instead this seems to have been hastily put together, almost as an after thought. C'mon - Marc deserved better than this!Buy the old edition and let's hope justice is done on the next anniversary.
START A T.REX COLLECTION HERE: I've always liked Bolan's songs but have previously only had compilations. Even though I like most of the songs on these collections I rarely played them because as often happens the songs did not fit together well for me.EW works really well as a whole and is a great listen in its entirety. I have listened to it loud and it ROCKS, then at lesser volume it works well too, with Bolans vocal stylings coming over well. This is a real 'album' that fits together so well with each song complimenting the others and while there is a definite overall sound there is also great variety within it. Interested in T.Rex? Start here. TIP Burn a disc without the extra tracks (burn them onto a separate disc if you like) as the album as it originally stood needs no adornment good though the additions are.
True Classic Rock: Many would think this album is good only because of "Get in On". That would be a wrong assertion. This album is exceptional from start to finish and it needs to be part of your library. One of the great rock albums of all time.
The Sexiest Album Ever Made: Although I was born around the same time it was produced, Electric Warrior is the soundtrack for my life right now. I first heard his bitter-sweet voice in the Velvet Goldmine movie and rushed out to find out who he was. I am a big Bowie fan, and I believe he sounds like the young elf-like Bowie. The only thing I don't like about this album is that I hadn't discovered it earlier in my life (think of all those wasted years!). Also, try making love to this album, it will be fabulous. The songs are tender yet naughty. If you enjoy Electric Warrior, try The Slider.
a 1970's masterpiece: T-Rex is the definitive 1970's glam-rock band. Electric Warrior features most of the most memorable tracks of T Rex including 'Cosmic Dancer', 'Get it on', 'planet queen', 'hot love', and 'Girl'. I would recommend this one along with David Bowie's 'Ziggy Stardust' as a good place to start in the genre of glam-rock. The music is a strange blend of simple riffs, mythically tinged lyrics, and interesting production. Truly a strange and beautiful album.
Bolan Belongs in the Hall of Fame: Electric Warrior is one of the best rock albums ever. Every track is pure genius and this albums rocks. Marc Bolan was unfairly neglected in the U.S., probably because he was worshipped by teenage girls in the UK--doubly unfair since so were the Beatles!! His body of work (also check out the UK box set, Marc Bolan 20th Century Superstar) stands the test of time, was totally prescient, and definitely rivals his main competitor David Bowie. Had he lived past 29 years, his commercial fortunes, which peaked with Bang a Gong on this album, would have no doubt rebounded. Marc Bolan belongs in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and shame on the powers that be for never nominating him.
My All Time Favorite Album: This is one of my all time favorites - if not THE favorite album in my collection. I remember seeing a picture of Marc Bolan in the early 80's and thought to myself, man, this guy looks wild - I've got to hear what his music is like. Thus began my odyssey to get my hands on anything associated with Marc Bolan.This album was the starting point - and it's a true gem. From the opening track, the hypnotic, sultry "Mambo Sun" to bombasitc guitars and violins on the closer "Rip Off", it's the perfect album - the centerpiece of UK Glam rock in the 70's.Tony Visconti's involvement here brings the album full circle. The mix of Bolan's poems set to music mingled with Tony's production and orchestral arrangements are captured perfectly in "Cosmic Dancer," my favorite track on the album.There's not a bad song here. If you're curious and want to know more about Marc Bolan and his band, T.Rex, look no further than this album.
i love this! it doesn't get much better: i'm only 16, and heard this cd a few months ago. since then, it hasn't left my cd player. it's really great, and can appeal to everyone. the guitars in this are incrrrredible! (of course there are quite a few of them)
One of the most influential albums of the 1970's: In my opinion, T.Rex is one of the most underated bands of all time. I also belive this is one of the greatest rock n' roll albums of all time. Next to Bowie's Ziggy Stardust, this is the most difinitive album of the Glam Rock era. Every song is great, and the extras make the album even better. Marc Bolan was a true musical genious, and one of the great forgotten artists. I would recomend this to any fan of old school rock.HOGEY OUT!
It's a Hard Album to Top: This is one of my all time favorites - if not THE favorite album in my collection. I remember seeing a picture of Marc Bolan in the early 80's and thought to myself, man, this guy looks wild - I've got to hear what his music is like. Thus began my odyssey to get my hands on anything associated with Marc Bolan.This album was the starting point - and it's a true gem. From the opening track, the hypnotic, sultry "Mambo Sun" to bombasitc guitars and violins on the closer "Rip Off", it's the perfect album - the centerpiece of UK Glam rock in the 70's.Tony Visconti's involvement here brings the album full circle. The mix of Bolan's poems set to music mingled with Tony's production and orchestral arrangements are captured perfectly in "Cosmic Dancer," my favorite track on the album.There's not a bad song here. If you're curious and want to know more about Marc Bolan and his band, T.Rex, look no further than this album.
One of the must have classic albums: This is an album of classic stature and should be in any music collection. It is with out doubt a MUST HAVE!!What are you waiting for..go buy it.
Self Understanding Self Acceptance: Truly the way for us to understand and accept others is to understand and accept ourselves. And then, because we are all different, it helps to use some of the gifts of synchronicity to understand how our experiences can flow through cycles ... this book makes these understandings clear and rich and accessible.The book is a keeper. It is the kind of book you can consult for your own cycles and the cycles of others as a way to understand life as process.Christine DeLorey's emphasis on emotional literacy, free choice, responsibility, and the healing role of feelings is, for me, the unique contribution she makes in her numerology. People can also find her website by entering Creative Numerology in the search engine. There she shares her work in a way that allows visitors to do a quick check on their destiny numbers ... in case things aren't going your way at work at the moment ... a little reading and your perspective, balance, and inspiration return ...
THIS IS A POWERFUL BOOK!: I received this book as a birthday present from a dear friend who has been following Christine DeLorey's work for years. Until I read it for myself, it didn't occur to me that numbers affected us all on such a deep and emotional level, but the impact it had on my perception of life, and on my life itself, was profound. Everything changed: my relationships with my husband and my teenage son and daughter, my relationships with friends and coworkers, and best of all my relationship with myself. Each chapter is like a monthly coaching session in which I feel increasingly better about myself and the poeple that make up my world. I would go as far as saying that this book has helped me realize that I didn't know just how deeply I was able to love. Life Cycles is written in such a down-to-earth, real, and caring style, and each time I read it I learn something new. It is the finest gift I have ever received.
astonishing accurate: This is the first book about numerology I bought. And I don't regret it. The delineations of the destiny numbers and the detailed year cycles made me perplex. How can just a number reveal so much and be so true ?? Awesome !!
Great for Travel: Recently I traveled to Portugal for a vacation and wanted to be able to converse some in Portuguese. I bought this program to do so and found it to be very good. I learned a great deal of Portuguese in a short period of time with this software. The conversation practices were my favorite part because I was able to learn many phrases and things to say in various different situations such as ordering dinner at a restuarant or asking for directions (this was very useful on my trip). I also really liked the video and audio features which were superb in every way. Even though I only used this for travel I learned way more than I thought I would so I would recomend this program for any reason- work, travel, education, ect.
Effective: Portuguese NOW is an effective way to engage in learning Portuguese. All of the features work well together to improve the many aspects of learning a new language. Overall, I just can't find a way to express how good this program really is for learning Portuguese.
Don't waste your money on this one: Kate Snell's book is riddled with inaccuracies and distortions.A French jeweller has released secret video footage which he claims proves Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed were engaged to be married when they died.
Book riddled with lies: This book was probably written only to make Prince Philip and British Intelligence happy about Diana's 'accident'. No mention about Dodi's supposed engagement to marry Diana shortly before the accident.
Total Fiction: Kate Snell's book is 100% fiction. She said the relationship between Diana and Dodi was not serious.Few months agao a priest broke his three- year silence to reveal how Princess Diana confessed her love for Dodi Fayed - and was going to marry him.Father Frank Gelli said the Princess even asked him if he could conduct her wedding ceremony. She confided in the highly- respected Church of England minister at secret meetings in the weeks before she and Dodi were killed.
Mediocre and voyeuristic tale of Diana's last 2 lovers: Uninspiring, petty and boring. I adored Diana, and truly enjoyed the exhaustively detailed biographies that have come out in the last 5 years. This isn't one of them. It is neither memorable nor does it have any excellent new pictures of the Princess - except the one on the cover. We read nothing new about James Hewitt nor Camilla, nor Will Carling, and a lot of drivel about Hasnat Kahn. Yawn. Wait for something else to come out.
Establishment Lies: There is no shred of evidence to back up this fantasy book.This pile of rubbish is aimed at wiping out the truth about Princess Diana's loving relationship with Dodi Fayed. And if you wipe out the truth about their relationship, then you wipe out the truth about how they were killed.British intelligence is behind the assassination of Diana and Dodi because their love affair was a shock for the British royal family. Prince Charles can kiss his two children good bye unless they are morons they will surely recognise the truth of what happened to their mother.Fortunately Mohammed Al-Fayed with deep pockets and a commitment to the memory of his son is out there speaking for truth.
Great reliable pump!: I've been using this pump for over two years and it works perfectly. It's been a real lifesaver during flooding periods. My smaller pump couldn't handle the volume of rain water. I couldn't find anything like it in the home supply stores. I was surprised to find it on Amazon. The pump is durable cast iron. I'm very pleased with its performance.
Suggestion: Require signature: Food item was left on porch at recipients home for 1 day. Standard shipping does not require a signature. I would suggest that someone arranges that a signature be required. Cheese was packed in styrofoam container with coldpak, but was warm by the time recipient found the package.I am told the cheese was fine (not spoiled) and very tasty. Product arrived in a timely manner.
you're on the ball again, Lynn!!: This, like all the FBorFW books, is fine comfortable family viewing. It is such a shame that everyone who reads it can't see the simple beauty of having a family (though 'fictional')like the Pattersons who really care for each other, their friends and their pets. Some of the other "reviews" I have read of this book seem extremely bitter and anxious to put down those of us who enjoy simple comics and stories of families where no one is on drugs or in prison for a hate crime or murder. If you want "gruesome", go watch TV and leave our Lynn Johnston alone!
Theoretical Analyses: Self-Defeating Behaviors reads as a college psychology text. Although the end of the book offers a methodical process to analyze and change your behaviors, too much of the book is devoted to the clinical study of our behaviors. I would have benefited from the book had it included more case studies and client experiences and less scientific explication.
Life Changing: When I purchased "Self-Defeating Behaviors: Free Yourself from the Habits, Compulsions, Feeldings, and Attitudes that hold you Back" I had expected very this to be a slow process. Nevertheless, to my surprise this was an instant transformation. The book was written in a way that openned my eyes to just how easy it was to change or shift my mental conditioning for the better. I keep this book handy so I can refresh myself about some of the self-defeating behaviors and how they are associated with other things or beliefs. Outstanding book, I highly recommend it for someone that is ready to take that giant step forward to change their life.
No info given at all: Not sure how amazon expects anybody to buy this scanner. It has zero information about it. Not even a model number, much less its resolution etc. It's a real pig in a poke IMO. Horrible presentation.Is it USB, is it AC Powered, what model is it etc etc etc.I especially love the descriptiion. Really fills you in well doesn't it?Product DescriptionMANUFACTURER WARRANTY: 1 YEARMight be a great poduct at a great price, but who would know or possibly could know when no information is given?
Eartha Kitt is Great: This CD is really a good one as she is such an exceptional singer. I have certainly enjoyed listening to it.
More Than Conquerors: An Interpretation of the Book of Revelation: An eye opening view of the book that is so hard to understand. I had gotten to the point where I just skipped over reading the Revelation, it had lost my interest. But Dr. Hendriksen's book has encourage and moved me to the pages once again. He leads us through the lampstands, seals, trumpets, bowls and thunders in a engaging conversation with the reader with details and Scripture for the student, and fine prose and an engaging style for the first time viewer. His organization of the book into "progressive parallelism" finally makes Revelation make sense. A classic!
An Inspiring View: Hendrickson gives an idealistic and inspirational interpretation of the book of Revelation. He focuses on the main themes and avoids the pitfalls of over-interpreting by trying to identify every symbol in this most symbolic of all books and attempting to assigning each a meaning.Instead, Hendrickson shows us the big picture, the grand sweep of the apocalypse of John the apostle. A very inspiring and encouraging way to understand this most mysterious of all the books in the New Testament.
Not very good...: I could only read an hour of this. I always hate doing this to my own brethren but I can't recommend this.
On it's way to the 'classic' list!: By and far one of the best books wriiten on The Revelation of Jesus. Easy to read and follow, even for the layman. If you want biblical accuracy, this book is a must for your library! Howard Hendriksen was richly blessed with an insight for truth, and has layed the book of Revelation out so simply. Never fear again some of the rhetoric of today concerning God's message for His Church. You will view the book of Revelation for what it is; A blessed message of hope to Christ's Church triumphant! Another excellent book is 'The Momentous Event' by W.J. Grier
More than Conquerors: Dr. Hendriksen was an excellent scholar and this is the finest treatment of the book or Revelation adapted for the layman I've ever read. I've given away many copies.
Bilingual and ESL Classrooms: Teaching in Multicultural Contexts: The authors emphasize relevent material and content towards the importance of "teaching in multicultural contexts". The excepts from teachers and students provide a personal connection. This book addresses issues of cultural diversity, Bilingual/ESL strategies, and provides a reference on laws and policies that have evolved to focus on today's changing educational settings.
DRY!: This book is awful if you are a first time learner of ESL. I thought this book to be full of big words that were needless and dry unentertaining language. I understand it is not meant to entertain but to educate, however, it was VERY difficult to read while trying to complete an ESL course.
bilingual n esl classrooms: I was very pleased to receive my book in time. The book was in great conditions, actually new. Thank you very much. It was my pleasure to do business with you.
I felt immediate relief from lung pain: I have a minor case of silicosis [which is by no means minor to me] that came on after one incident of breathing diamotaceous earth. The pain in my lungs was terrible. This product took over a week to get here so the acute phase was passed by the time I got it, but my lungs still were hurting a lot and I just gave it a try. After taking Bronchial Soothe for the first time just a couple hours ago, right away the pain in my lungs began to subside and within minutes I hurled up a mass of frothy mucous from my lungs. Sounds disgusting, but it felt like heaven. I'm not fully healed, but I do feel so much better after one use of this product.Based on my first experience with Bronchial Soothe and the relief I have already experienced, I would definitely recommend this product to others.
Works well: A friend had given me some last year, tastes terrible but works, just hold your nose. Bought more this year seems breathing the cold northern air makes my lungs hurt, this soothes them.
Very Very Large!: I agree with another reviewer who said that these are extremely large earrings.However, I am actually returning mine for that reason. In my opinion, they aregaudy and look phony, and they are not at all what I wanted. I feel terrible aboutthis, too, as I had requested them as a gift, expecting stones more than half thesize and more useful for everyday wear.If you are shopping for jewlery on Amazon, please pay attention to size! If you areunsure, PLEASE double check! I wish I had saved myself the trouble! Hopefully, Amazonwill begin including scale-reference photographs for products such as these.
unique and indispensable: The 'Go To' product to prevent transplant shock in shrubs, saplings, and plants. Not widely available in most nurseries, where you can find many brands of rooting powders for preparing cuttings, but not usually this Vitamin B1 product to establish new root growth in transplants. A bottle of Hormex last lasts a long time, because only a very dilute solution is needed.
Excellent book on Doves: This is everything I'd ever want to know about the care and maintenance of these wonderful birds. I wish the print had been just a little larger in some places but overall it was a very good book on the subject, one of the best I've ever read.
Best dove book I found on Amazon: This is the most comprehensive dove book I found here on Amazon. Contains good information about many subjects including illnesses and treatments unlike the other books. If you have doves then I recommend this book.
Best Book For Raising Doves/Pigeons: I bought this book, and it's sister book Pigeons, the day after I was given an orphan day-old pigeon chick to raise way back in 1997. Normaly I deal with domestic birds (bantams, budgies, ect.) so when my Pidgie came to me, I knew the basics, but I also knew I didn't know enough about pigeons to raise him on my own. These 2 books were all I needed, they provide all the info needed to raise happy healthy pigeond and doves from chick to adult. I am so glad these 2 German classics had been translated and reprinted into English, I don't know what I would have done without them.~~EK
Didn't work for us.: Unfortunately, this product did nothing to make it easier to brush my daughter's hair. It was supposed to make it softer, but it actually made it harder to brush. I really wanted this to work because as my daughter's hair grows, it gets more difficult to brush. Wish the result would have been different. :(
Good artists, bad selection of songs: The set contains some really good artists. However, they don't sing the songs for which they were known for singing. Nearly all are singing songs normally associated with another artist. Maybe that is why the song list isn't given on the site. In my opinion, not worth the money even though it is low priced.
Club 8 The Friend I Once Had: I heard Club 8 on a college radio station on the way home from work one day. I waited through a bunch of other songs to find out who they were. The song I first heard was "Someday." When I got home I checked out a lot of their music and decided to purchase "The Friend I Once Had."Club 8 are a duo consisting of Johan Angergard (all instruments and songwriting) and Karolina Komstedt (vocals). Johan writes and performs the perfect music for Karolina's beautiful vocals. All of the songs are great. "All I Can Do," "Someday," "The End of the Affair," "Karen" and "The Friend I Once Had" stand out as the best to me.A very excellent album. I will be getting some of their other albums soon. I like Club 8 very much. They're really great.
good quality: This is a good quality poker. I agree that it may have been a little better if it was just one piece since the end seems to want to unscrew at times but it's still an excellent product.
Poker: Not the quality I need or I suppose expected. Although I suppose if I lower the expectation, this would be OK to push wood around in an outdoor fire pit.
Fabulous baking sheet: This cookie sheet is fantastic. I own some very old, paper-thin sheets that I got from my mother and I own a Vollrath. The Vollrath is heavy-duty and bakes evenly. It works great with parchment paper or on its own. Unlike my very thin baking sheets, this one does not burn the bottom of the cookies before the tops are done; however, it does add a few minutes onto the cooking time, usually 2 to 4 minutes. Also, I like to put cookies on a cool cookie sheet so that they don't start baking right away and the thin ones cool down almost immediately, but this one has to be run under cold water, which is inconvenient but certainly not enough for me to give anything but an excellent review to this baking sheet.
Baking with confidence!: Quality heavyweight sheets performs exactly as described. I had borrowed cupcake pan recently, using it and one of mine this past fall. Noticed the big difference in performance and results. My pan is lightweight compared to friend's and the good quality one certainly outperformed my inexpensive lightweight pan. Seeing is believing. After that, decided to replace my goldtone cookie sheets (which never been thrilled with results) with the Vollrath before holiday baking. So glad I did! Definitely worth the investment! And made in the USA.
Worth Every Penny: I heard about this from Cooks Illustrated, and it is worth every penny. I have had it for a few months, and it still looks brand new. No warping, even heat and browning, and easy to keep clean. A great gift for any baker.
Glue problem solved: The glue that attaches the label to this produce has been discontinued. Instead the sheets arrived with a peel-off plastic that was easily removed. The edges are sharp, it's true, and I'd be cautious when handling them to not let my hand slide along those edges. But, the quality of the metal is top notch, and these should last for generations giving consistent baking results. I'm thinking about having my husband polish those edges to round them off. I wonder why it isn't done at the factory?
The best cookie sheets I have ever owned!: I almost never write a review. But these cookie sheets are so amazing that I felt I really needed to write a review on them. I have been baking cookies since I was eight years old and always found it frustrating that some cookies would burn while others on the same sheet would still be underdone. I finally decided to pony up the cash and invest in quality cookie sheets. I am beyond thrilled that I did! The first batch of cookies I baked on my new Vollrath sheets came out perfectly! That's right -- each and every cookie was perfect! Browned slightly on the edges, golden on the top and bottom, plump in the middle -- you baking afficianados know exactly what I am talking about. I will never use another cheap cookie sheet again. If you love baking like I do then purchase these cookie sheets. You will never bake a burnt, uneven batch of cookies again.
Great for serious bakers!: These sheets are excellent and well worth the money! They are sturdy, will not warp, and the cookies still come off with ease. The main thing is the true even baking across the entire sheet. Spend a little more and get these--they will last you a lifetime!
Great baker: Read the first review of this in a test off by Cooks Magazine. I have 2 nad just bought 2 more for my daughter. Cook evenly, don't warp. Do discolor, but that doesn't bother me.
Awesome Intake Filter!!!: I just got today my intake and installed right away.... I went to the beach (2 hour travel) and I feel a nice difference and throttle response... even also the engine sound is better... I am using this intake in wife 2002 Corolla with 7afe (Asian model) with a Dynomax Super Turbo and the whole setup is perfect for the car.
better title 'Words about the Dragon, Press Reports': The title of the book Words of the Dragon, Interviews 1985-1973" reflects a little bit a wrong impression of the book. A better title would be Words about the Dragon, Press Report 1958-1973". At the beginning of the book a few things are repeated over and over again. It seems that it would be difficult to investigate e.g. how old Bruce Lee was when his parents returned to Hong Kong. Only at the end of this book one could catch a small impression of Bruce Lee's philosophy. His carrier as an actor comes primarily up. The US Press didn't understand until Bruce Lee's death that his art wasn't Karate. I expected more philosophically thoughts and background knowledge of his martial art. The Bruce Lee connoisseur gained no really news and I thing the book isn't stimulating for beginners. I was impressed by the letter of Brandon Lee, which is printed at the end of the book.
Still Bruce, but...: I heard several of these interviews from other sources. If YOU haven't then the book might be worth your time and money, but then again even the interviews in the book get old. Each interviewer asks the same questions and Bruce gives the same answers. It's less thrilling than other Bruce Lee books.
a very good book on a true warrior: i've always been a big bruce lee fan and this book though it repeats itself alot, takes you to some of the events and circumstances he was going through and dealing with. he was truly a ground breaker and a peace maker who made an incredible impact on so many lives. a must have book.
words of the dragon: This book gave me an insight into the personality of Bruce Lee. it is the second book about him i have read. The only thing i do not like about this book is one peice of information which it gives without correcting it in the notes. He didn't die in hospital; he died in the house of an actress which he and Raymond Chow had gone to see about offering her a role in the film Game of Death. While they were there, Bruce got a headache and took a pill and retired to the bedroom. That's where he died.
Misrepresented on Manufacturer's site as English subtitled - please be warned, there are NO subtitles: This is a review forDona PerfectaThe manufacturer of the DVD claims that the DVD has English subtitles (please refer to link below)[...]Based on good reviews I read on the internet, I purchased a used copy of this (the same UPC as posted in the mfr site) It does NOT have English subtitles as claimed on the manufacturer's website. Video quality is that of public domain. Disappointed but subtitles could have redeemed the experience of subpar video. Please be warned
Girlz Suck, ha: This whole CD is super overplayed stuff we're all tired of. The only one on this album who can even sing a note is Christina Agulara because even if she is trashy, she has a nice voice.
Sucked.: This CD is horrible, don't waste your money on it. Caleigh Peters was the only decent one on the album and she isn't even that great, she sounds kind of manly. All of these songs are released on some other CD so I don't really know why Disney put this one out. None of these girls can sing.
barf: GIRLZ ROCK????Dude, at least use proper grammar if you wanna be taken seriously. A pure sign that you're trying to appeal to 10-year-olds who believe there's such a thing as "girl power! omg giggle giggle"... oh, and can't spell.
Hmmmm....: Ok, so it was ok. Lindsay Lohan was so-so, and This is My Time was good too. Otherwise, please don't waste your money!! Download Limewire or Bearshare, they're free, and download any song you like!!!
Positive Message with a Good Beat: I searched for a while for a good 'starter' cd for my daughter, she is 6 yrs old and we monitor what she listens to and sees quite a bit, so I wanted something 'today style' but still positive and I got her this CD and she really likes it.. she has a great time dancing away in her room to it. I like the positive message in the songs and she loves the great beat.I would recommend to parents and kids :)
Party Anyone?: This CD is great for a sleep over or just to listen to when your feeling down. I'm 12 and this is great music for a party with me and my friends durring the summer by the pool. We play it as backround music and when we here a song we like we a sing along and dance!! This is a great cd if you are a real girly girl! The songs have and up beat and some calming smooth souds. This is a great CD, if you don't believe me listen to the 30 second segments of each of the songs. I promise you, your tween and her friends will love this Disney's GirlZ Rock!
Hehe...Secret Addiction: My friends would be shocked to know that I listen to this CD ona regular basis. I love the Calieigh Peters song, and Hayden Pannetierre & Myra's as well. They are great for young girls, and even for teens as I've discovered. I even find myself liking the Lindsay Lohan songs! I never thought I liked her music, but these songs are an exception.This CD really is great.I liked it alot.
pouring splatters and drips: I love the size of this jug, but when it's fuller it splatters and drips when you pour. It will also leak if it tips over. I'm surprised Rubbermaid has put a product out there like this. I have always trusted a Rubbermaid product before.
love the jug,hate the leak: I bought this size jug so that I could drink directly out of it.No matter how tight I got the lid,it leaked.So if you drink anything but water get prepared for shirt stains.This could be fixed with a rubber seal/gasket.So why don't they??
NOT Leak Proof: The product is useless, it leaks in the car during transportation a n d while drinking. V e r y disappointing.
Not as depicted: Picture indicates a flip top but the it was the same cap style we were trying to replace. Caps break easily and bottles tend to leak.
The handle pops off every time!!: This jug would have been great except the handle pops off EVERY TIME you use it. VERY annoying!! It pops off on both sides. I actually bought 2 of these jugs, from different sellers. The handle pops off on BOTH jugs. This product was a very bad design.The latch that you flip open to take a drink ALSO POPS OFF every time you use it!!DON"T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY - get the kind that has the spout that flips up.
Disappointed: The charts were advertised in English but they are in Chinese. Impossible to read. Of no use at all.
Forgot to mention not in English?: I was looking for one with translations into english. Found one that did translate.Problelm is its the only one! Sorry didn't work out!
ooOOOPPPPS! Amendment: I compared 'The Time Machine' to 'The Fantastic Planet' - This was a typo, I meant 'The Forbidden Planet'.If possible please amend.Thanks.
Much better than the Remake: I watched the remake of the Time Machine and expected it to be awesome. It wasn't awesome, but it was ok. The special effects were really cool and all, but the story itself seemed to move too fast. I then went and rented the original Time Machine. I liked the original far more than the remake. The scientist narrarates the whole movie and the story is so much better. I will admit--the special effects were cheesy, but what can you expect??This movie was made in 1960!! If you want to see a great movie that has mystery, horror, action, and suspense, this is the one to buy. I reccommend this highly to everyone!!
George Pal's 1960 Version Is Still The Best: I know it's dated, but that doesn't keep it from being a decent and entertaining film. George Pal's version closely follows H.G. Well's book written in in 1895, except for a few changes. In the movie, the Eloi are normal sized people with blonde hair that can speak, instead of being much smaller and mute. The Morlocks resemble Troll dolls with light bulb eyes that make them seem less sinister than the book does. Weena, the female Eloi that almost drowned, is captured and eaten in the book, but Pal kept her alive so there was a reason for Rod Taylor to return to this time in the future.
Despite the obvious sets: and sometime stilted dialogue, this remains one of the most watchable and entertaining films of the genre ever made. FAR superior to the new version. A definite must-own.
Let's go ahead with our Time Machine: What a great movie. Rod Taylor Takes HG Well's George the main charactor through time. He tries to find a better world. Yet as far as you can go things remain the same. The special effects for the 60's was great. HG Wells was showing how he felt about society. Making the rich useless Eloi and the working people doing the work the monster Morlocks. Just sit back and enjoy a fun movie with great actors that you can feel that they were the charactors from the book. This movie was charming, exciting and a true classic. See it.
campy: Part of the problem with TTM, is that it was made in an era where technological restraints made it impossible to duplicate Wells story. Still, the deviation from the book, makes the movie hard to take. It's "Lost in translation".
Worth it for a laugh: Like any old campy sci fi movie its good for a laugh just to see crappy sets and terrible Morlocks. I dont think anybody takes this movie serious, well i hope not anyways. The same people who like this movie are the same ones who say the remake is terrible.
Time Machine: Very disappointed - apparently my TV, DVD player, computer, and any other DVD play I could put my hands on is not in the right "zone".....still sitting on my shelf waiting to be returned.
Q: I have a wonderful film, with great extras, yet...: ...I have no image nor sound. What am I? A: A defective DVD. WB needs to get their freakin' act together and release better cases for their DVDs and insure quality in all releases. This disc tried to load for a while and stopped at 'No Play'. What fun!
Not the movie I expected: I ordered this movie thinking it was the one that I saw approximately 5 years ago. It was not I am passing it on to someone else. I was happy with the shipment time and price.I ended up finding the movie I was actually looking for called TIME MACHINE (2005?)I love Amazon but sometimes you have to really look at what you are ordering. I did not think to look at the information on the bottom of the page.
The Memory was better than the film: When I was 12 and this film came out, I was enthralled with it. Recently I had the opportunity to revisit it, and was really let down, with the schmaltzy dialogue, cheapo sets and makeup and cheesy special effects. I dare say that any 12 year old today would think the same thing, as they're conditioned to today's more sophisticated sci fi movies. I have high hopes that Dreamworks will do it right with their new verison of the film.
An awful film: Why this film garners praise is beyond me. My idea of a true sci fi classic would be "The War of The Worlds". This film is cheesy and ridiculous and frankly the sfx are way outdated. And please, in the future the human race is made up of BLUE EYED BLOND HAIRED PEOPLE???? Sounds Hitlerlike to me and I am insulted by the premise. I'm glad this movie was updated with the newest version which looks at the human race in a much more realistic and non insulting way. For that reason alone I would support Simon Wells' version.
It was interesting, but it did not make me think.: That will not happen in the future. I still found it hard to stop watching it.
Awesome classic: Classic telling of H.G. Wells's masterpiece. I would recommened this product to any fan of classic sci-fi. I do like the recent rendition, but will never beat the classic.
Thank you Mr. Pal: Thank you Mr. Pal for giving us a classic. Rod Taylor is the Time Traveller and Alan Young is the one an only Filby. This movie is just fun to watch. I love it as well as the mini-film reunion Time Machine: The Journey Back. Rod Taylor and Alan Young back together with Whit Bissell. This little film has more heart, warmth then that so called re-make last year. I have to say it was a joke. Also, I read that Simon Wells saw the small film on the DVD and said that the Time Machine prop was made by Don Coleman. WRONG it is the real Time Machine prop owned by Bob Burns. Mr. Wells do your homework, maybe that's why your film will never be a classic. Mr. Pal's film will be here forever!!
The Time Machine: I used to watch The Time Machine in black and white TV when I was little child. I did not understand what they said because of my deafness. Now I just loved it in color and even closed-captioned in an excellent condition. I just prefer to get the closed-captioned video tapes so we could enjoy to watch them.
old but always amusing: No matter how many times I have watched this classic, I still find little things which I missed .If I ever had to pick movies for a collection, Time Machine would be at the top of that list.
Good sci-fi movie... If you like H.G. Wells you will like this movie: I definitely recommend this movie!!! It has a good story line from the beginning to the end... you will not be disappointed!!!
Time machine Review: This is one of the best movies ever made. This isn't just a classic, this movie is one of the movies that paved the way for other sci fi movies. This is as much of a classic as Wizard of Oz or Gone with the Wind and in my opinion this is better than both of those movies put together.
"Before its Time": I first viewed this film when I was 11 years old and I must confess that seeing this movie impacted my whole life. I still have drawings I did in grade school of glass-domed futuristic houses with large double entrance doors. The time machine itself, is so humorous, but it is what they would have had in the 1800s for such a contraption. I was entranced by the Eloi and their lack of emotion and having to do nothing but eat fruit all day. My infantile mind thought that would be a GOOD life. I consider this a much better movie than its "twin" Journey to the Center of the Earth, but they were both great and thought-provoking, especially to pre-teenagers. The scenes and special effects are phenomenal. It is because of this movie that I probably eventually decided to write a time-travel novel of my own. Rod Taylor was not my favorite actor, but he did a very good job in this movie.
The Time Machine (Original): The movie is still as great as when it first came out years ago. The service was quick.
The Time Machine: Really Great to see this clasic again. Arrived in good time, no defects and good condition. thank you
A sci-fi classic: OK - the movie rocks!First, it was a great movie with an awesome plot and the idea of time travel was explored well.It was really entertaining.And ...... the extras were great too.You get to see the original time machine prop restored and a lot of cool stuff.I really liked it.
The Time Machine DVD: The DVD is excellent. DVD was received in excellent condition and before expected delivery date.
A Waste of Time: As much as I want to love this movie - I've seen it several times - I just can't. As the story moves forward in time, I lose interest to the point that by the end of it, if still awake, I'm irritated.
the time machine: the stream was pixelated and kept on stopping and starting. There was no smooth stream. I tried to watch it at different times on 2 different computers same results
Be Careful - doesnt' play in all DVD players!: This DVD will not play in some of the older DVD players - it is the first one we've bought out of 100 that is that way. On the box it says something about Dual Track format. Beware!
Maybe.: goods: period setting, good charactersbads: unfaithful to the book's endingthe best version of this movie as of today, 2005overall: maybe
A Safe Sci-Fi: This is one to watch if you like sci-fi films, but don't like a grotesque, horror flick. The plot is built around the traditional good versus evil with good triumphing.
Classic: This movie is one of the better quality movies from the 60's. With very little special effects the story line is great. The warning of what faces the world if we don't change our ways is played out very will here. Excellent actors in Rod Taylor and Alan Young.
What a classic!: Lately I've been on a collection kick for classic sci-fi. I love this version. I used to watch it as a kid when it was on the local stations. Like an old friend. Bought it new, and it was shrink-wrapped and everything was perfect. AHHHH...I love it when things work out like you expect!
Old Stories: I'm presently doing a "life's review" in that I'm accumulating old stories for my library that were popular in my days of yore. This version of THE TIME MACHINE fell into that category.
was not able to play: i got this for my dad and we were going to watch it and would not play on computer and 2 differnt dvd players .. do to it comming from a different country
Just As I Remembered It From the 1960's Saturday Afternoon Matinees: I was just a little kid when I last saw this movie and this time around it was just as I remembered it. As usual, Amazon was reliable and the product was delivered on time and just as I expected.
classics on dvd: I heard some bad reviews on the quality of transfer but I thought It was just fine the colors werent as vibrant as the VHS I was replaceing but some people may like the colors more toned down. personally I thought It was well worth the price I paid & liked it better than the remake.
Truly A "Timeless" Classic: What a great film!With beautiful imagery & a re-engineered soundtrack to match,this is truly a collectible classic.The bonus material as to the making of the movie & the tracking down & restoration of the original time machine prop were worth the price of the DVD alone.
the best -time machine: it dont get any better full of great thoughts and class and great ideas and lovely blonde girls blondes are more civilized than brunettes, good call on director this one should get six stars. the new one came out after this is worst crap i ever seen nothing butt special effects and some kind of racist attitude butt this 1950s is so good and represents how people were back then very good. i should know my ancestores go back 1640 in ameirca.
One of the best: This was one of the scariest movies I had seen up until it came out in the 1960s as a child terrified that the A-bomb was going to drop any time I heard a fire alarm. When the Time Traveler gets to 1964 and the air raid sirens are going off, that was it for me. The movie was turned off! I didn't see it in its entirety until several years later and I outgrew (mostly) that fear. I even got a copy of the book and read (most all of) it, for it, too, is a chilling tale of "what if." I happened to watch the 2002 remake last night and it was OK, and entertaining. It definitely has flashier special effects. (How is it that Guy Pearce can outrun those CGI speed-induced Morlocks?) Still, this one with Rod Taylor and Yvette Mimieux is the granddaddy. It won't disappoint.
Fantasy Classic Forever: George Pal's classic movie is a delight from begining to end, and, surprisingly, much closer to Well's book than his great grandson's lame remake, with much creepier Morlocks. The documentary on the DVD is a mixed bag, with great stuff about what has become of the machine itself, it's rescue and restoration, and also odd stuff with Alan Young and Rod Taylor in a sequel scene that contradicts the movie. The documentary is dedicated to the memories of George Pal and Mike Minor, the latter a friend of mine who is much missed. Skip the remake and enjoy the original.
The Most Intriguing Sci-Fi Film Ever: With the idea of Hollywood making a remake to this instant classic, starring someone who is not Rod Taylor makes me shudder in contempt.See this. Buy this. You'll be taken on a journey of intrigue like you've never seen. Reject the laws of physics and just enjoy this campy '60s film. You won't be disappointed.Scenes of Rod Taylor using the machine to go forward in time is some of most must-see, and edge-of-your-seat moments in any '60s film.
Falls short as a wireless security reference: Wireless networking is the hottest technological innovation of the past few years, but the unpleasant fact is that security is its greatest weakness. In a crowded market of computer security titles, a niche exists for a book that lays out wireless security problems and couples them with solutions.Unfortunately, this is not that book. While well written, the book is thin on security matters; security is only first dealt with in chapter six. That coverage is interrupted by five chapters on building wireless networks. Discussion of security doesn't resume until chapter twelve.Despite its title, the book is more about setting up, configuring, and managing wireless networks, with occasional digressions into security issues. Only about 35 pages of this 320-page book directly deal with wireless security. The book would make a good introduction for designing wireless networks, but it falls short as a security reference.
The song's pretty cool and the remixes are even better: I listen to this song on Music Choice and I love it!!!
VERONICA MARS ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Great product. Great price!!!! Best buy suggested retail = $50.00 and I got it for $19.99 on here. Can't complain. Very satisfied considering price and how much I saved! shipping could have been a little faster but whatever, price I paid for it was worth the wait. =)
I love veronica mars: If you are a Veronic Mars fan you must have this third season. I have eveyone watching and it's wonderful to play and review with friends. I can't hardly wait for the next season.
LOVE!!!: I love veronica. The only thing I can say bad about this season is the fact that it is the last one!It does seem a little cut off at the end though. Didn't feel like a good closer to me. But it was still a very enjoyable season and series overall.
Veronica Mars: I really like this series. I hate it didn't last longer. Kristen Bell is a good actress, best of luck to her.
Woo!: I'm a huge Veronica Mars fan and having this at home to watch as much as I want has been fantastic.
Completely Entertaining.....one of the best.: My girlfriend and I started watching Veronica Mars on a 7 hour plane ride. Her sister (25 yrs) offered it to us about 4 hours into the flight. We watched it for the next 2 hours until our mac died. It sounds silly that we love this WB show so much, but seriously, we flew through season 1-3. We are both 23 and in law school (i know that bumps us down a few notches on everyone's cool radar) but seriously, you should really give it a try- I am sure you wont be disappointed. The characters are very well developed and you eventually learn to love them all. Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD- you can thank me later :)
i love & miss veronica mars!: i was so sad that they took veronica mars off the air! i love this show and the characters and the writing. now i have the 3rd season on dvd so i can watch it anytime i'd like...which is like all the time. i also have seasons 1 and 2.
MUST SEE...: This is a great series and I have watched the entire season two times already. I love the honesty of the show. If you love detective movies you will love this one. Kristen Bell is a great actress.
Veronica Mars, the best TV show EVER!!: Veronica Mars is the best TV show ever, hands down. To own the entire series on DVD is a must. Hopefully, enough sales of Season 3 will lead to an eventual Season 4. The CW Network has dropped our beloved Veronica, but Season 4 had started filming, and is being shopped around to other networks, with the possibility of a full length feature film in the future! :)JS
Happy: The item was package well and it came fast. The product came on time and no delay. All the DVDS were there in the season box set.
Veronica Mars: I thoroughly enjoyed Veronica Mars for its flawed heroine and story threads. Veronica was capably played by Kristen Bell, sarcastic, witty and judgmental, I cheered and commiserated with all the characters and was disappointed that the end was so up in the air. Why is it always the intelligent shows that get canned? Perhaps the 'powers that be' are asking the wrong people what they watch.
not so thrilled...: I bought this series on 8-22 for my girlfriend. We both have rather busy lives and she doesn't get a chance to watch a whole lot of tv. I also bought the second season for her as well. (no problem with that one)... By the time she got around to watching the series the 30 day return policy had expired. The dvds did not play properly and I have no way of returning then for an exchange. Just wanted to make a note to anyone interested. Need to see if they play properly before the return time runs out. Now I'm stuck with a series that's no good :/ ...
The first season is better...: I think it's kind of telling that the third season could barely pull two million viewers. A lot of the characters I enjoyed watching (Wallace, Weevil, Mac, Lamb, etc.) were relegated to appearing once every 6 episodes or so. Veronica's still snarky and bitter even though she's had no reason to be since Season 1. Jason Dohring puts in a performance as Veronica's doormat. All I can say for the third year is hey, the new opening credits looked nice, and maybe there are a good 3 or 4 episodes in the lot. Veronica might have been better off if it had been like Freaks & Geeks - brilliant but ended way too early after only one year. By the end of Season 3 it really was more like "Why is this show still on the air?"
severely upset over this purchase: not only was the last disc cracked, but the third and fourth disc were missing!! someone went to to alot of trouble to make this disc set look new in a sealed package, what a scam!!
And now for something completely different.: The cast of this show are surrounded by Gumbies, and knights who say "Neeh", and the Lumberjacks who sing the Lumberjack song. Yes, I am saying Monty Python's Flying Circus has more laughs and talent then this brainless show.
Great Show!: This was a great show, but it got cancelled. There's sort of a cliffhanger ending that leaves you highly annoyed that they never picked it back up. Oh well.
Mars is Magic: The complexity of a multitude of simple puzzles overlaid on the larger darker mystery, the versatility of Kristen Bell's acting and the strength of the cast makes this a series well worth watching. One of my favourites.
Great series!: This is the best series I have seen in years, it is a shame that it got canceled mid story. It needs to be brought back full force! You go Veronica!!!
VERONICA MARS=automatic 5 stars: Season 3 is not as good as season 1 or 2 but it does have its moments and season on its own still deserves 5 stars but i were to rate it as compared to the first 2 seasons i would give it a 4......if only the netword would have stopped meddling!
I love this too!!!!: Veronica Mars is one of my favorite shows! So I was very pleased when I got it & it was in perfect condition! thanks again, R.
we lost one of the best: A great loss for the viewers. Unbelievable that they canceled that show, while other grapy shows continues to flicker over the tv screen into our homes. this was really one of the detective shows i have ever seen, a genre that i never cared much about lately untill i heard about Miss Mars and her wicked talents.And now we r back in the dark ages, too bad, but at least we had 3 seasons of fun, excitement, intelegent and twisted storries, crowned with convincing good actors.So what can i say about Season 3 of the Mars triology, its a must have for me and totaly fun to watch...my advice, buy, u wont regrat it.
I LOVE V. MARS: So as you can tell from the title I"m a huge V. Mars fan. The main question is why aren't you? Season 3 has more snappy comebacks, more edgy plot lines , and more adultish situations. By no means is Veronica a push over but there are situations where she is "put in her place" in a more adult sense than when she was in High School. All in all the third season is both more and less realistic. In both cases however it is totally awesome and in my opinion better than the first two seasons in the show has progressed to this point naturally. Someone should slap the faces of every WB exec who voted to cancel this show it was really beginning to come into it's own. Anyone who liked the girl let cast of Buffy and other such shows should be watching Veronica Mars!
Not as good as season two, but good.: This season ended really abruptly (20 eps). There is a preview of season 4 that takes place after she's in th FBI. Good concept, but all previous characters have been washed, and there's a awkward relationship from the start. I predict season 4 would have floped.
Veronica Mars Season 3 epi 1 - ONLINE: LOVE IT! However I wish they showed more of what happened in the summer between Logan & Veronica. They just skipped all that and picked up on when they are already in college. But they could have done a flashback as they did in season 1.OVERALL - Still fabulous.
Ahhhh!: I NEED this show to come back! You wont be disappointed! Best 3 days of my life obsessing over this short series. The only horrible thing is they leave you hanging. I can't handle that!
Veronica Mars: The Complete Third Season: As much as I love Veronica Mars, I was rather disappointed in the way the series ended. I want to know what happens with Veronica and Logan, or how bad the Sheriff's election was. These questions were never answered. I did, however, enjoy the season 4 preview. Too bad the season never aired.
Best show on air!: Veronica Mars is the best show on air! Well that WAS on air.. but don't worry! We crazy Veronica Mars fans will bring it back! Bars for Mars!Veronica Mars.. She's a marshmallow..
Season Three -- Different than the others but still pure VM!!: I love Veronica Mars. I don't use past tense here because even thought he show has been cancelled, I still love it. I still watch the first two seasons on DVD and have kept a few of the Season 3 episodes on my TIVO.That being said, Season Three had its ups and downs. Kind-of like Season 4 of Buffy, taking VM out of High School and into college came with his great moments and it's failures. There were some brilliant episodes, some just plain amazing, and some that were just okay (But an okay episode of VM is still 10 times better than most of the crap on TV)! I feel that if the CW had let Rob Thomas do his thing, we would have gotten a stronger season. And maybe a 4th.Season Three was great VM. The season as a whole wasn't the strongest (most would say 1 still is but I argue for 2 - loved the whole year-long story arc) as the others but still it was pure Veronica Mars.I'm going to miss Veronica Mars but I still very much love the show!
Worth it for the bonus features: For all the VM fans out there, it is very bittersweet to watch the (extensive) bonus materials included in the VM season 3 dvd. There is a season 4 pitch (about 10-15 mins), but it was just enough to get me salivating for more. Then I realized the CW is a bunch of morons and there will be no more.Anyway, for VM first-timers - you will enjoy this DVD, but, I highly recommend picking up seasons 1&2 first. You won't be disappointed.
Best Show Ever: Loved this show, wish they hadn't been dumb and cancelled it after 3 seasons. The show had major potential.
Why I started Watching: I never watched the show before this season. Turthfully I didn't know what it was about. Then it was aired after my favorite show Gilmore Girls and I was hocked. I thought the show was witty and reminded me a lot of my old favorite, BUFFY!! This season was the reason I went out to buy the first two seasons. Now only if there were a season 4 that would make my day!
This season made me wish for season 1: Man, I loved this show, once. Season 1 was awesome. Season 3, however, is a total waste of time and money, and absolutely not worth buying. The characterizations are hamhanded and juvenile. When and if our favorite characters show up, they are mere shadows of what they once were. The writing is terrible, and the handling of sensitive subjects is clumsy and immature. It's like, when Veronica went to college, Rob Thomas went back to high school.Don't buy this. Save your money for better television.
Super Pissed that it was canceled: This show is fresh and smart and always had clever idea for new cases and stories yet it was canceled ?? When Smallville which is sorta just dragging on these days is going on to it's 7th season. But hey at least that's way better than 7th Heaven which at least isn't coming back. Why can't the CW bring back Veronica if they could bring back the lame 7th Heaven after canceling it. I got into Veronica Mars the most this season, so it really bugs me that it got canceled. Hell I think everything was canceled but Smallville and Supernatural, so why would they have to cut this show too ? It was actually good even if Veronica could act just a little too much like an overly goofy version of Buffy. It was still a really good unpredictable teen detective show and beats a lot of the crap shows that actually weren't canceled this year!
Season 3 -worst of the lot: For fans of the previous seasons, season 3 leaves a lot to be desired--a whole lot. The once outcast Veronica is now the apple of everyone's eye. The once charismatic Logan is whipped. The once best.father.ever Keith now trades creepily sexual banter with his daughter. The once intriguing plot lines are now reduced to entitled Veronica all the time. What happpened to the ensemble cast? The funny, snarky dialog? The emotional intensity? The sharply drawn sense of place? That's what I want to know because it certainly is not here in Season 3.
Complete do it yourself manual--Readers Digest: I have had one of these for years..It allows me to do all kinds of repairs on things around the house..Even diagnosed my washing machine when it quit!!! I knew just what to tell the repairman when I called to see how much it was going to cost me to get it fixed!!! I bought this for a friend and now she can do the same. NO ONE should go without this book!!! Can't beat the price with Amazon !!
Reader's Digest DIY Manual: This is a classic must have! I have even given it as a gift to others to get them started. Look for "USED" versions in "LIKE NEW" condition from top rated sellers...you'll save a ton of money over the cost of new.
Great reference book: This book is fantastic. It was bought for me by my dad when I bought my first house and it is one of the most useful books i own. It covers most subjects you are likely to need in any home DIY situation, as well as garden DIY and relevant legislation that may affect your DIY projects. I cannot stress enough how invaluable this book is and how often I've referred to it, even if I've decided I'm not confident enough to tackle the problem and call in an expert. A must have along side your tool kit.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
Wow!: I am a new homeowner. A co-worker let me use his book to do a plumbing project. It seemed like a big and time consuming project! But when I read and followed the instructions, it took me less time than I anticipated. This book is easy to understand and the drawings are clear to follow. I am ordering my own copy.
do it yourself books: paperback, ok price, good service, good information, donated to a charitable home improvement library, satisfied
VERY CLEAR, VERY USEFUL: Very convenient, well explaned, clear and useful book. It gives you all the necessary information to fix any usual problem in a home, and even more. You don't need to be an actual worker to understand it. I am a woman and I'm very glad to have this book.
Reliving American Colonial history from the water-side.: De Gast, let's us see Colonial America from a hidden side seldom viewed from the freeway's blurr of contemporary homogeneity.The slowing down of the mind and the pace of the soul as he explores the rivers that feed Chesapeake Bay in a small sailboat is intoxicating. Somehow this Dutchman has found the magic we first experienced with Huck Finn and Jim on that raft on the Mississippi.Ah! To be messin' about in boats.
Don't bother.: Way too outdated. Basically useless if you are considering traveling to India. I am surprised anyone is still carrying this book on their shelves.
Not like to old affinity revo: I thought I was getting the old affinity 56 wedge but when it arrived I could see from the finish that it wasn't the right one. It didn't feel or perform like the other 2 wedges I own, the 60 and 52. it was a waste of money for me.
here's a fun series to try: even though i've never read a book in this series,i loved it and the delivery was very fast!great doing business with the seller!
Never received the item. Got a response from vendor though: I am sorry to say I wanted to buy this toner because it was fifty dollars less than Office Depot. It never came and my emails to the vendor and to Amazon have yet to be answered. I had to shell out eighty dollars for toner today after waiting desperately from day to day hoping my old toner would last. It has been about a month now. Oh well. UPDATE I did receive a nice response from the vendor ultimately, offering to rectify the problem.
did not work: This product had a big line running through the middle of the page. I think it was old stock
WARNING -- THESE ARE EXPIRED CARTRIDGES: Although advertised as "new" and "original" and were bought directly from Amazon, both cartridges I received were past their expiration date. Additionally, one of the cartridge boxes itself was damaged even though the Amazon shipping box itself was not.This is first time I had this experience with Amazon. From another customer comment dated October 2009, Amazon appears not to care about disclosing this on in its web site advertisement.
Not Good: I purchased the print cartrige thinking I would get a better deal verses going to a office supply store. The print cartridge delivery time was prompt, but the cartridge produce streaks on the paper upon printing. I notified the seller and had to do a second notice. The sellar apologize stating that they were out of town and he also stated that he never had a problem with the cartridges before. I return the cartridge and the money was return promptly.
HP Repacement Printing Cartridge: Product started off with streaks and blotches. I cleand roller a couple of times before it cleared up. I would not buy again, I would pay the extra $20 at Staples. How do you return a product that you have constantly in use, albeit with poor performance?
How the package arrived: The product I ordered arrived promptly, but could have been better packaged. The original cartons were simply taped together, with the result that one of the boxes was crushed at one end. Won't know if the cartridge was damaged until I try to install it (will be a while).
Can't beat OEM quality: I purchased this to replace my used up Laser Jet cartridge. It has worked like a champ so far for a couple months. I even was able to fix the slight mis-alignment problem the HP LaserJet 1200 series was having.There's certain things I have to buy OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and this is one of them.
This is a Recycled Cartridge - Be Aware: I purchased this from Amazon and it was shipped from a vendor called "Second Chance Industries". The box was an old, used HP box all glued and taped. I used one of the cartridges and got extremely poor quality prints. Indeed my old one was giving better quality prints when I replaced it. I opened the second one. The second one was even worse than the first one. Do not get this product. I am surprised that HP is allowing such a gross misrepresentation of its brand and products.HP LaserJet 15A Print Cartridge - Retail Packaging - Black
Defective product: Not sure what was wrong with the cartridge, but it was completely useless -- basically, it produced an entirely black page. I've bought literally dozens of HP cartridges in the past, from other sellers, and never had any problems before.
Not a good way to buy print cartridges: When you buy these cartridges you are really rolling the dice. I have done it twice. The first time I got a cartridge that worked fine. The second time, though, I got a cartridge in a resealed box that prints very faintly. Not quite unusable, but pretty close.The key problem is the revolving door of resellers involved here. Some appear to be good, others are clearly selling inferior products. It's a shame that Amazon allows some of the latter group of sellers to appear as the default seller on the product page.Strictly buyer beware on this one.
Stay clear: I only rated this with a star because I had no choice to rate it with no stars. Stay clear of this seller. They do not refund your money when you return a defective product! First order was defective, replacement also and then no refund from that when returned to seller.
wow!! now THIS is a movie!!: I'm a fan of all types of movies.and own tons.This movie, I just added to my collection today cause....IT'S FANTASTIC!The atmosphere set in this movie will scare anyone!Very dark, creepy and just an all around great movie!Great moody score keeps you as scared as theteens themselves!Leatherface and his family are just..Horrific!The Sheriff is also too perfect in his role!andJordana Brewster looks as beautiful as ever!I hope they make another Texas Chainsaw movie of this quality!Order this from Amazon now!!and crank up the volume andturn off the lights!!!
Brutal Goriest TCSM film: I Love the original the 2003 & the Beginning movies best out of all six "LeatherFace" films that have been made=the 80's & 90's sequels were a bit campy with a twist of humor, but the 3 films I mentioned are on the more serious side in the true horror genre.This is a creepy flick that shows, once again, "A monster" is basicly made into a killer by being the rejected of society and taken in by a sick, twisted family.This movie is the goriest of them all, yet is as dark as the 2003 movie and really go hand in hand together like Halloween 1 & 2 are truely interviened and both could stand as one long film.I think TCHS could stand as a trilogy with Beginnings as #1 and the 70's and 2003 films are so different from each other, could just be seen as parts 2 & 3 or as stand alone stories of LEATHERFACE.Definately one of the best horror films of the year. Can't wait for it to come to dvd to complete my TCSM dvd collection!
TRASH THE TRASH: The cinematic equivalent of paying good money to sit in a landfill on a hot summer afternoon. Incredibly repellent violence with absolutely no message except that there are millions of suckers like me who gets his curiousity aroused at times and buys a 'matinee special'. My "arousal" lasted exactly ten minutes (a suspicious duet in the cinema started staring in all directions with eyes blazin' and gazin') so I decided to "blow town",if not my lunch. This is easily a worse movie than "A Clockwork Orange",something I thought I'd never be able to say.Don't be content to merely avoid this abomination, urge a boycott!
Gore, blood, torture and teenagers: It's 1969--for the beginning of the Texas Rampage.I don't usually care for slasher sequels, but I loved this one. It was filmed well and the acting was good.Director Jonathan Liebesman is a bit too fond of the shaky camera effect, which works momentarily to freak your view of the craziness of the movie, I liked it.Plot-crazy Southern folk killing, torturing and eating teenagers who pass through (nutsville Texas), and it doesn't hold back on the gore, blood, cannibalism and so on.Nispel's "original" is better, but this one still delivers.
scary!!!!!: This movie made me jump in my seat at the movie theatre so I had to have it. Even after seeing the movie I still did a little jumping when I watched it at home. This is a great movie and it helps you understand more of how it all got started. Highly reccommend if you are a TCM fan.
Excellent Movie: If you are looking for a good gorefest with a fair plot and some suspense, this is your movie if you are looking for Oscar material as other reviewers look at horrro movies, then yeah! they are right this movie is [...] I am sick of this so called Cult follower to try to make themeselve look hip or cool just by trashing remakes as there is just the One and only. TCM 2003 and TCMTB are grat movies, modern visions of an old story. They have their fair amount of plot, lot of gore and suspense, fair enough for a horror movie, just entertainment. By the way if you seek a horror movie that change your life or did a horror movie changed your life you might need some help. Also correcting somebody here; the Tobe Hoper Texas Chainsaw Massacre was not in "glorius black & white" it was in "grainy 70's color" and for the other guy, please do not worry this movie was not real, no people disappeared so no shame.
Sucks..Buy the 2003 film instead.: This is supposed to be sort of like the "evolution" of Leatherface.It was a very short evolution,because it goes from showing us his birth,a woman finding him in a dumpster,than to him as a man working in a meat factory.It completly misses his entire childhood.We also get a little glimpse of how R.Lee Ermey's character becomes a "sheriff" in here too.Thus,this is supposed to be a prequel to the 2003 movie.Unfortunatly,this failed in my opinion.The storyline is dumb,and the characters are not even likeable.There is not even a "so bad it's good thing" going for it.R.Lee Ermey's funny little wisecracks weren't hardly even in here,as compared to the 2003 film.The two actors and actresses that played the teenagers in this movie,could not act.Overall,I don't recommend this at all.Just stick with the first film.
If you like the remake, this prequel won't disappoint you: I just had the pleasure of watching the masterpiece called The Departed last night, but I just had to squeeze in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning to quench my thirst for horror this weekend. So today I went back to the theater. In some ways I thought this film was better than the 2003 remake. The gore was taken to a whole new level, and Leatherface is one really bad dude this time around. I couldn't believe some of the gross out gore they got away with here, and I believe some will even be thrown back in for the DVD. Jordanna Brewster was very hot (could those jeans get any lower?) and a decent actress, Andrew Bryniarski was a menacing Leatherface yet again, and R. Lee Ermey stole the show yet again as the town "sheriff". This movie is worth checking out if this is your thing.
The Best Massacre: I have seen most, if not all, of the versions and sequels fo the TCM. This is the best by far. This is one of the best slasher/horror flicks I have ever seen. I have absolutely nothing 0 to say about this movie. It actually deserves a 4.5 rating. I would recommend this fo any horror fan. I fear this movies' success was cursed with the same curse as Halloween H2O, Jason X and Aliens 4; great movies all, but by the time they were released most poeple were tired of the franchise. This just isn't the best of the TCM franchise; this is one of the best horror/slasher flicks ever. I know this movie is supposed to be based on a true story,but being a romantic, it would've been nice if the girl had survived at the end. I hope this is not the last in this franchise, especially if these same writers can perform this same magic with another script.
well, it has gore...: mildly amusing and zero percent thought provoking or original. Lots of sub par gore that is cashing in of a franchise instead of really adding anything new for true horror fans. Hot chicks and chainsaws...yeah, i get it. If your a fan of new horror this has high production value and is right up your ally. If your old school this is a been there, seen that film.
lame money maker: This new verison of TTC was very lame and not wrost 18 dollars for it. Maybe when only 10 or less it be wrost it. The first and remake were not believeable either, but this one just dumb. i was very dispointed with it and i say rent it if you must, but do not buy until really cheat.
Nice, but . . .: As there is no American release of this film, which is mind-boggling, I had no choice to order the Canadian blu. While the picture and sound are very well done, and super sharp, that is ALL there is to this disc. No trailer, no featurettes, no deleted scenes. The American dvd has all of these and a few more tidbits to gnaw on, but Allied's bare-bones offering is movie-only. If you love the film, get it, but don't toss or trade the dvd just yet. Maybe Warner/New Line will give us a good blu in the future, but the optimal chance for a good release came and went with the premier of Texas Chainsaw. Sure, Warner didn't make it, but with a Chainsaw in the theater, a blu would have "made a killing" so to speak.
Depressing With No Redeeming Qualities: Simply read the other one star reviews and that will sum up my feelings about this piece of trash. I watched this on cable and it is just another example of how the horror genre has gone totally wrong.
Good Horror Film: Overly Gory? Not to me. If you're a horror fan I dont see how you could say this is ''overly gory''. It had its moments but thats what this genre is about. It had a lot more gore than the original but it was still an entertaining movie.Setting: 60s- 2 brothers and their girlfriends are on their last road trip before getting sent back to Vietnam. They end up getting in an accident and when the sheriff comes then the terror begins. This movie tells the story of leatherface and the family. It reminds me more of the second film and third films in the series. Its nowhere near as good as the original but I found it to be better than the fourth film and the remake of the original. It was somewhat different in the way that no one survives. It has a lot of unexpected twists to it. This was no masterpiece of horror but it was entertaining enough and a decent addition to the series.
Please enter a title for your review: Although it started slow the second quarter started picking up steam but the second half is a waste of film. Exhibit A in the case of the horror genre being populated solely by lazy genre-loyalist writers and directors who wouldn't know a creative idea if it disemboweled them. I spent half the movie willing it to get to the point and half the time when it did wondering what the point was. Boring sterile conventional suspense and climax, no plot points or characters to wonder about, no chance of anything coming out of leftfield, it just sets a tone and hammers and drones away at it. No big things needed to be changed to improve the film, it's just the little things that weren't there to hold your interest and make it worth watching, no attention to detail. They've got a perfectly functional skeletal plot outline for a movie, they just needed to let some creative writers do something with it before it was ready for filming.
I never thought I'd say this but: This movie was as good as the one with Jessica Biel (as far as the scares). Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm thinking the recent remake (with Biel) kind of started the re-revival of horror. Please be warned though. It is not easy to watch at all because you are really rooting for the kids and you know how these things turn out. But man, what a pulse pounder and that counts for a lot!
I'd give it zero if I could...: What a total piece of trash. There really isn't much to be said for this film. The prior remake from 2003 wasn't exactly great filmmaking, but at least it did what a horror film was supposed to do: it scared the audience, gave you some characters to root for, and created a whole lot of supsense. This film does none of those things. Walking out of the theater, the only word I could think to describe the film was pointless. If you thought other horror films had nihilistic endings, just wait to experience this. Oh wait, don't experience it. Don't mistakenly give this film any money like I did. It will only encourage the studios to keep adding on unnecessary installments to once-respected horror franchises from 30 years ago. This film is a travesty and a disgrace to the amazing movie that was made back in 1974. I'm shocked that Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel would even attach their names to this drivel.
GOD AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!: This movie really sucked i thought it was going to show his life from the start it showed him born then did this little slide show thing threw his younger ages then all of a sudden he is like 18. i think they should of made the movie longer and showed some more of his childhood. also the movie wasnt really scary and it was far from exciting. but i gave it 2 stars because the acting wasnt bad at all, and the killed somebody it was in a sick and cool way, and the deaths did look very realistic. if you are going to buy this to complete a collction thats why i did. but if you are looking for soemthing as good as the 2003 remake this isnt it.
SADISTIC PLEASURES: Since we know that this prequel will have several follow-ups, we pretty much know what awaits our four young victims in this cruel, sadistic and unnecessary entry in an already bloated series.The film relishes in the sadism it supplies as each of our four heroes meet gruesome, bloody deaths. It's sad because these four youngsters aren't your typical sex-starved teens you want to see offed; these four seem more mature and their fate is doubly disgusting. Add a performance from R. Lee Ermey in which he seems to enjoy the perpetration of these acts of sadism and you have a horror movie that repels more than frightens, and hopefully the last in this series honoring a brutal clan of misfits.
Leather face with his chainsaw mackes one heck of a goar feast: Fist of all for you people that like extras you might want to pass this up it his no extras at all there arent even sceen selections on here but... put all that aside and you got a good horror movie.The effects looks so real its unbeliveable.This movie shows how leather face was born plush it shows how the sheriff became sheriff thit is the only reason it's called TTCM:The beginning.If your a horror fan you shuld pick this up.
another swell performance by r. Lee Ermey delivers the bads: if you really enjoyed the brutal remake to Tobe's original film you're probably gonna dig this prequel . i only detracted one star as we do not get a Ms. Bile ending . just the filmakers choice . i respect that . i think both young directors do an excellent job of scaring the hell out of the audience . i can kind of understand the older viewers cleaving to their 1970's baby . i'm that way when it comes to a lot of films as i was born in 63' and resist a lot of the modernizations in filmaking . these films are of the horror genre though . i see their redux's as a good thing precisely because they can show a lot more of the grue and spatter . they're better photographed . i'd have prefered a more up ending . that may well have been untrue to this very hostile vision . yet again r. Lee Ermey absolutely steals the show as the head of household .
The remake of the first one was better then this: I wanted to love this movie so much since i LOVED the remake of TCM.but this...i cant explain what happened.sure theres lots of blood and gore but something was missing...oh yeah,any form of entertainment.this movie has alot of boring parts and lags alot.the kills are great dont get me wrong but the movie just feels way different.watch the remake of TCM and youll see what i mean.R.Lee Emery steals this whole movie and hes the only reason besides the gore to watch this movie.i would say to rent this one or if you must own it buy it used from someone on amazon but DONT pay more then five dollers for it trust me youll feel riped off.
Texas Chain Massacre.The beginning: This was a scary movie.You will not be disappointed at all.Well written and produce.The acting was good.Plently of blood if you like that.
Hopefully, the end !: Wow, what a waste of time and money this pointless "prequel" is. Just another reason to lay on the gore with a garden hose and once again cash in on the title with little regard for the audience or even a decent plot.Waste of time!!!!!!!!!
What type of fresh hell was this!!!!: Why is this movie even in existence? The 4 characters/victims where so undeveloped that you couldn't even make enough of a connection with them to even care whether they lived or died. It lacked scares as well as good writing. The characters were making unrealistic mistakes, one after another, throughout the duration of the movie. The acting was mediocre to downright cheesy at times. The only reason that I am giving this one star is because of the very realistic make-up artistry that was used to show gore. Other than that this movie was a hot " throwned together in two days" mess.
Sad, - 0 stars if I could give it: Yes, if you know nothing about good horror and think Scream or The Grudge are classics, then this is probably a great movie to you! Watch the original from the 70's and tell me that this even comes close. I think it's sad that people can't tell that this is Hollywood throwing together garbage to make a quick buck.
Don't fund this movie, even though my stupid self did....: Please do not go and see this movie. It's just another sequel/prequel that companies just pump out at audiences so they can make easy money. This movie is just not good....at all. It isn't scary, nor does it have a sensable plot. There is a fair amount of violence but even that didn't save me from turning my attention to the pizza i snuck into the theatre to eat. I like movies with senseless slaughter, such as the Friday the 13th series. Those movies are extremely fun to watch. I cannot say the same for this crap-fest. Just save your money people, and go buy some cheeseburgers.
AN UNIMPORTANT REMAKE: SOMEHOW, YOU JUST SEEM TO GET LOST IN IT ALL WITH THE SAME OLD STORY JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL. TO BITTER AND SORT OF DISTANT FROM 2003'S THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, COMES A PRESEQUEL THAT NEVER LETS OUT A GASP OF HORROR AND BORES US WITH SOMETHING WE ALREADY SAW 30 YEARS AGO!
Bearer of the pipe: This is one of a set of books about the native Indians ;they are interesting reading.They also describe some of our local country
Opened my eyes: I found this book very helpful because it opened my eyes to a whole new form of investing that I was never aware of before. It's well-written, gets to the point, and showed me very specifically how to set up my own divisified portfolio online, at an unbelievably cheap price. And what I really liked about the book was that it offered a number of pre-selected portfolios of blue chip-type stocks that you could start with immediately. Walden has done his research.
Not very good poses: The model is beautiful but the poses are not very useable at all from an artist standpoint. They are very awkward and unnatural poses. I was looking for something more classical, some seated or standing back poses. I'll be returning the book. "The Nude Female Figure: A Visual Reference for the Artist" and "The Beginner's Guide to Photographing Nudes" were much more useful for what I was looking for as an artist.
Female Nude Pose Book: I was disappointed in this book. The quality of the photos is fine, but the poses are not what I am looking for. I need a book containing classic "classy" poses. The majority of poses in this book are far from "classy".
Figure artist will like this.: This is a good book, not great but good . I like to draw from a pose book like this and I love the large black and white photos.The book is all one model who is perfect on just about all levels and the photographs are top notch, but the pose's are a little cheese cakey and in some shots she has on high heels.The model is placed on a solid black background and I think it push's the figure out in all parts but the hair.I do think this is worth buying but I don't think it's worth the $45.00 thats on the book.If I can not draw from life then drawing from a book like this can be a big help.I hope they come out with more, but for less money.
Say "cheese" cake: I ordered this book because of the glowing reviews. Even the review that was 0 sited "faults" that I view as pluses. I returned this book as soon as it arrived because I found the poses to be cliched cheese cake for the most part.
a must have for all Spanish students: This book is AWESOME! It's a must have for all who are determined to get past the basics and really start talking like a native Spanish speaker. I recommend it to all of my friends who head overseas to Spanish speaking countries.
Just BUY IT.: Not for the beginner, it's for people who are sick of the same B.S. in traditional books, it picks out fine details that you would normally get in a college level course...I van say that because I am in a college Spanish course.
Leaving Lessons: After 2 winters of twice a week lessons, I needed to get out of the formal class room setting. This book helped me touse the knowledge I've gained and put it to use in the " real world ".
Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish: This is a great book! I have studied Spanish for 10 years and didn't think there was anything I could get out of a book for "beginners". My friend had the book with her when we went to Guatemala to study Spanish and I started reading it on the plane because I had nothing else left to read. I read the book from cover to cover and enjoyed every page. The author does a great job of explaining false cognates; it made me laugh out loud at the stupid things I have said in the past, and was embarrased by some vulgar things I've said and not realized it. I recommend this book for Spanish students of all levels.
A True Gem: This is a true treasure of a book. For an intermediate student, it answers many question that you ask yourself, but are never answered in text books.The author didnt learn spanish as a hard core academic, he learned it the real way. He went through the same struggles you go through, and is able to help from that point of view.I've bought many books on spanish during my self led quest to learn the language; some very good, some bad, but none compare to this one.I just wish the auther would consider writing a second and even third book and expand his unique insights into a series.
Great advanced beginner's book that delivers on its promise!: This is a wonderful concise book for taking your ability to speak Spanish to a higher level quickly. This upward movement is usually painful and requires a tremendous amount of work. However, this book gives you what you need to know in a relatively painless manner.You will about many common mistakes that non-native speakers make and correct them by following the well-organized, short lessons presented in the text. Specifically, you will overcome the bad habits that are holding you back and replace them with new ones that will boost you to the next level.I own many Spanish books, software, audio tapes and CDs. This text is one of my top "must have" choices for moving forward quickly and enjoying the ride along the way!
disappointed: This book didn't increase my vocabulary or make me feel more confident in my spanish speaking ablilities. It can help improve how you communicate the spanish you already know. It doesn't help you learn knew words, and only helps you learn some general sayings and help with words you choose to say depending on who you are talking to. It's very long and boring, worst of all he explains almost everything in English! How can I build on my spanish if all I'm reading for the most part is English? I've read many spanish books and I must say it's more boring then any other book I've read thus far! Which I know is opposite of other posts I've read. weird. One example the book gives is for the word adios! I think everyone has a general idea of when to say adios and in what context after begginners spanish. Wish I didn't waste my ten bucks on this book:(
The most entertaining language book you'll ever read!: I recently bought another copy of this book as the first one has fallen to pieces from much use. It's not your typical language text and not for rank beginners but it certainly gets the points across in an easy and often humorous manner. The lack of an index is a minor annoyance, and who has ever died from having to flip through the pages of a book?
Didn't help much: I was given this as a gift because I am learning Spanish. This book is written in English. Not for helping you actually learn Spanish but for tips on Speaking Spanish. I will return it ASAP as it is useless for me at this time.
98% is in English - Don't expect to learn the Spanish language with this book!: Do you want to learn the "Spanish Language" in "English"? 98% of the book is in English, it is just informative, like a dictionary type but with slang. Info could be helpful but you won't learn the Spanish Language!!!!
Absolutely Useless: This book might be good for people who already have learned some Spanish, but is completely useless for someone, like myself, who just start learning Spanish. So disappointing.
Annoyingly fatuous: I ordered this book to improve my knowledge of the subjunctive mood in Spanish. When the book arrived, I could not find "subjunctive" mentioned in the table of contents. A quick skim of the book revealed that there was indeed a chapter on the subjunctive; it was titled "The Twilight Zone" (most of the other chapters also have cutesy, fatuous, vague titles). I began to read "The Twilight Zone" and noticed, in the second sentence, that the author refers to "the subjunctive mode," not "the subjunctive mood." Immediately suspicious of the author's knowledge of grammar, I discarded the book and went looking for another.
Great book: This book really provides a unique insight into a realm of a foreign language that you probably will not find in your textbook. Handy information indeed.
My husband's 'good' reader: I have been told that this book is excellent. Thanks for keeping him busy with his Spanish reading! He loves it.
Absolutely Amazing: I loved this book. I've been studying spanish for about 5 years, and I'm currently in college level spanish. I loved the author's sarcasm, it added some spice to the writing, and it allowed you to understand the context for which the words were meant to be used.
Good, But Not For Beginners: As the title implies, you are breaking OUT of beginners Spanish, but not BEGINNING Spanish. This is a very good book for the intermediate level learner but too advanced for the novice learner.For real beginners, the best book I have found is Conversational Spanish in Nothing Flat which came with 8 CDs.
Not as good as their first: I really liked their freshmen release, A HILLBILLY TRIBUTE TO AC/DC a lot. AC/DC+bluegrass: Two crappy genres that manage, somehow, to sound just ducky when melded into one. But Mountain Love lacks the twisted, psychobilly focus of that effort. It's merely AOR+bluegrass.The only songs that work to any campy degree at all on Mountain Love are CENTERFOLD, CAT SCRATCH FEVER and FEEL LIKE MAKING LOVE; the latter of which sounds, at best, like it was a SOGGY BOTTOM BOYS outtake. I LOVE ROCK AND ROLL and BIG BOTTOM are just plum embarassing; the latter being a travesty of a parody of a sham of a travesty... FAT BOTTOM GIRLS doesn't belong here, at all.My advice to Hayseed Dixie: Next time make another hillbilly-hardrock tribute. There are tons o' worthy/lousy candidates for the pickin': KISS, Metallica, Black Sabbath &/or Led Zeppellin come readilly to hand. Stick to a proven formula: metal+bluegrass
poor quality but still useful: I must agree that one could do a *much* better job of making a cd-rom for learning dutch (or the other languages). There's no systematic teaching of sentence structure, grammar rules, etc. - it's very poorly designed as a "language course". Also, the program (I'm using the Mac version) is many years old, and hasn't been updated for OS X. The sound and video are low-resolution and grainy.On the other hand, I do find it useful, if only because a cd-rom is a better tool for practicing than a cassette tape. You can easily skip around the texts, click on individual words or whole sentences to hear them, see the (not always helpful) translation, etc. - so I would say that in conjunction with a *real* language course (maybe a good book) this could be helpful for extra practice. But ideally I would like to find a good-quality cd-rom language course. Anyone know of one?
Disappointed: As a CD designed for English speakers who want to learn Dutch, Learn Dutch Now 10.0 failed miserably. The content must not have been reviewed by a native English speaker, because some examples are given only in French or German, and many examples that are given in English are incorrect! Obvious errors and poorly designed learning structures abound. Of course some useful content is contained, but not content that one can rely upon if your reason for learning Dutch is for more than entertainment. This is my third language and my fiance's sixth, and neither of us found it useful enough to be worth the money or the time we invested in studying. We now have to invest in another program and spend many more hours studying from the beginning. We're not pleased at all.
Great Product!!!: I purchased the lingerie cage at the same time as the original blue braball to see which one I liked better. I have a front loading washer and the first time I used the braball it popped open sometime during the wash and my bra was loose in the washer. I have used the lingerie cage 5 or 6 times now and it has been great!!!! I have washed up to 3 bras at a time and they did fine! Highly Recommended and great price too!! Getting ready to order a second one.
Cheap Materials and Construction: The 'Lingerie Cage' does everything as advertised, but the product is made with cheap and flimsy material, and I can already tell that it will have a short life. After the first wash, I noticed a small rip/tear in the mesh material by the zipper. I'm not sure if it was there before I threw it in the washer, or if it ripped while it was tumbling around in the delicate cycle, but I'm not a fan.
Cups dented: I've been using this for over a year, and it has held up. My bras are shaped for nipple concealment, and I've learned to put the underwires in vertically; this keeps the whole thing from flattening as much. The round ends hold their shape, but there are no bones to keep the cylinder from going to the tuna-can profile. The bras are clean, but I had hoped it would preserve the shape of the cups better.
Enjoyable read: This is one of the better Amanda Stevens books that I have read. The original idea of having a river monster seemed a little far fetched but Stevens puts it all together very nicely at the end. Some good romance between Shelby and Nathan-showing that love will always be there to guard you and take care of you.
Pretty good reading here.: At the age of nine Shelby Westmoreland claimed she had seen a creature rise from the river one foggy midnight. No one but Nathan Dallas believed her. They parted ways soon afterward.Years later, Nathan was back in town after he had ruined his career as a reporter. Now he ran the small local paper. Shelby was back too. Her husband had been murdered and his killer had almost gotten her too before the police captured him. Shelby was in town to heal.Shelby's grandmother was recuperating from a broken hip, so Shelby ran her store for her. But her Uncle James was out to take over the store and get rid of Shelby. And someone was out to hurt Shelby, permanently! Once again, Nathan would be her protector and, he hoped, even more.**** Not bad at all! A bit predictable, but I had many things totally wrong. Author Amanda Stevens seems to get better with every book she writes! ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch
Best Book I've Read in Years!!: Amanda Stevens' book Nighttime Guardian is an amazing Intrigue. I love the fact there there are at least 4 mysteries to be deciphered. The story hooked me from the first line, "Pearl River Monster Strikes Again!" The story is a real page turner, and impossible to put down once you start to read it. Her characters are compelling and very real. The story is very fast paced and extremely enjoyable. Thanks for a great read Amanda!
Great Sports Watch!!!: This is an incredibly hot looking watch and is made with precision, down to the great black leather band with the yellow stripe! Easy to read, and a great conversation piece, all bundled in a Skagen Swiss movement- not Japanese!!
This is an excellent, genuine Beanie BUDDY!: This Beanie BUDDY is a wonderful additon to anyone's Beanie BUDDY collection. He is a genuine, soft purplish bear with a beautiful wide ribbon and padded hands and feet. The Beanie BABIES don't have wide ribbons or padded hands and feet, but the Beanie BUDDIES do. This is a Beanie BUDDY, it is not a Beanie BABY! This is a great BUDDY, and it is a must-have for any collector! This Beanie BUDDY is excellent!
FAKE!: If you are an avid Beanie collector, you will notice right offthat the one they are displaying on the picture is a fake beanie. Tynever has thick ribbon on beanie babies, only on beanie buddies. Also his feet are not like that, they have no pads on the feet what so ever. I've been collecting for years, and I also own the real Millenium Bear and it doesn't look like this bear at all! Please make sure you look at the pictures carfully before you get ripped off! ...
Makes cute cookies!: After trying the Heart Molds similar to this product, I decided to try the Easter Bunny ones for a party. I did not use sticks for my sugar cookies and found they worked fine. Once again I found that the suggested cooling was is a bit low, suggesting 5 minutes. They are just to soft to get out of the pan at this point, so I wait at least 10 minutes.My only real difficulty was that it was very difficult to see the facial imprints on the cooked cookies. I thought that I had pushed the dough into the mold pretty well but some of them came out with marks you could hardly see at all. Not a big deal, because you can pretty much decide where you want your own eyes etc anyway.I made some heavily decorated with frosting and some that just had their eyes, nose and mouth. My guests loved both!
Perfect fit: Just the right size (measure yours correctly before ordering!) but I wish it came in other colors. I primed/painted mine, BUT the paint scratches off where the latch is. :( It's exactly the size I wanted though, as my lock spacing is "older" and not the newer 5.5" or 6" OC, so my local stores didn't stock this size.
Environmentalists versus Big Oil interests: If you want to read a book about the environmentalists fighting big oil interests in NE Alaska, this book is for you...As was promised, it has very little to do with a computer scientist/photographer who supposedly quit his day job and barely avoided bankruptcy to write/photograph this book...The author is nothing more than a pawn of the Sierra Club to save the environment in NE Alaska who has thrown in some very nice pictures for effect...It's obvious that he has been heavily financed by outside interests with their own agenda...They are worried about drilling for oil and saving the pristine area...That doesn't stop them from driving their gas powered quad runners/snowmobiles through the previously pristine tundra...To top it off the Alaskan Eskimos show there appreciation for the animal kingdom by having their children dance on top of a dead whale while wearing a L.A. Lakers jersey...This book is hypocrisy at its finest...No thanks...
why I want to see this book: The is not a true review: indeed, I have not yet recived the book for Amazon.I just came home from a dinner with Peter Mattiessen at the University of Tulsa, at which he spoke passionately of the phyiscal and finacinal effort Mr. Banerjee undertook to create this work, the reaction in Congress to the book, the pressure upon the Smithsonian and the American Muesum of American History to quash display of Mr. Banerjee's photographs, and his personal fears of deportation or worse by the Justice Department under the Patriot Act. A most frightening portral of the reach real or reasonably feared of this Adminstration when an individual, spcially an alien, dares question its motive. As Senator Stevens(R)Alaska, chair of the Senate Appropriate committee was reported to say to his colleages after Banerjee's testimony, and the Senate voted 52-48 against drilling in ANWR, "I know who you are and you will pay".To cause such a reaction--it must be worth having.
Rascals: This is the Rascals without the Young in thier name,dropped it after the 1967 Groovin album, this is the 2nd as the Rascals & is very good,the drummer Dino Danelliis the reason I started playing drums,seeing this group on Ed Sullivan but especially Dino Danelli just blew me away at a young age & this album keeps up with thier growth as a band,some great tunes,great vocals & Dino Danelli on drums,if you only know the Young Rascals & the hits,try this or any of the latter albums they put outGreg H
Wonderfully creative!: I don't know how she does it, but Rebecca Cole delights, amazes and inspires me again! Her third book contains arrangements from the whimsical to sassy and she breaks them down step-by-step, like a big floral arrangement cookbook. I have attempted the Checkerboard Flower Box (about half the size of the one in the book) and it lasted nearly two weeks, thanks to the wonderful conditioning tips. My other favorite section is the Welcoming Windows, about making the all important first impression. Throughout the book, Rebecca Cole shares personal stories from her childhood.Helen Norman's photographs are breathtaking - sharp and colorful - and there are a LOT of them. This great book helps a lot during long, grey winter days until my own garden begins to bloom again.
Flower Power Rocks: This is the third book I've read by Rebecca Cole and they just keep getting better. Rebecca's new book is filled with cool concepts and writing. She talks about creativity, encourages it, and uses refreshing--sometimes even irreverent--humor throughout the book. Flowers are not too precious for this designer and this reader appreciates all of the tongue in cheek. The flower arrangement results are sometimes whimsical and always stunning. Funny, smart, and beautifully photographed and designed, Rebecca's book is my current favorite gift item.
Orlando: That's the second VW book for me to read (the first being the excellent to the light house )In orlando i must say i found myself feeling the worse thing you can experience with a book : struggling to finish it !That's not due to the fact that it is poorly written ,no... on the contrary but i didn't like the idea of the book !I mean ,VW gives me the feeling that she is an angry person and reflecting her anger on unending pages , it left me with the feeling that if she was a Man she would have written that book anyway but this time critsizing her gender
Adult fairy tale...: An adult fairy tale exploring gender roles, role reversals, and the creation of fiction/poetry in Elizabethan to early 20 c England (with a brief stop in Constantinople and a stay among the gypsies along the way). Hilarious and inventive. Marvelous prose. By the way, I saw the movie some years back and was very confused by it - not so with the novel.
Prepare to have your mind expanded.: On top of the beautiful imagery and quirky central character, that tricky Virginia Woolf brings us scary, unusual ideas and makes us listen...and care...and laugh...and see the world in a new way. Isn't that what art does?
Glorious piece of art work: Once you get into the flow of Woolf's tangled web of a world, this book is at the same time poetic, philosophical, and a beautiful social commentary. I love it!
Great Read: This book is really a must for all baseball fans... it is really an engrossing read and a good look into what baseball was... back in the glory days. If you love baseball, and not just modern baseball, but the spirit of the game, you'll love this book.
Absolutely Wonderful!: To be able listen to the actual players as they were interviewed by the author is flat out fantastic! I listened to the CD's and was spellbound. I can't recall any baseball item that I've enjoyed more and would highly recommend these CD's to anyone that enjoys the "inside" views of baseball history.
Quite Possibly the Best Baseball Book Ever Written!: A book like this can never be written again. This is your chance to hear from several of Baseball's stars from the "Dead Ball" era firsthand in their own words. Included in this book are Rube Marquard, "Wahoo" Sam Crawford, Smokey Joe Wood, Edd Roush, Paul "Big Poison" Waner and many others. This is the only book I have ever read two times, back-to-back. The tapes of the actual interviews will be my next purchase.
A must read for any baseball fan: The Glory of Their Times is a wonderfully put together book. Each ballplayer's story is unique and interesting. I literally couldn't put the book down. I have read a lot of baseball book's and this one is certainly at the top of my list.
A Collection Worth Keeping: When I was young, I wasn't interested in hearing about the `old times'. Now that I'm older, the old folks are gone and I've missed out hearing their stories forever. In a way, this book is a second chance. Lawrence Ritter has made a Herculean effort tracking down all these players and getting their stories. Baseball fans owe him many thanks for the job he's done. There are many interesting stories told between these pages, but one of the most surprising to me was that these players called the games themselves most of the time. No coaches and the managers sat back and let the players play, for the most part. I especially enjoyed the story by Rube Bressler about three players ending up on third base at the same time. This is a must have collection for baseball fans. I thought "The Greatest Baseball Stories Ever Told" by Jeff Silverman was a little more entertaining, but this collection held my interest too and is a book worth keeping.
Wonderful book: I am a sports nut who also loves to read American history also. This is far and away my favorite book as it meets both needs. Anyone that loves to read about the early days of baseball should read this book. The author gives you a first hand view of the ear heroes of the game through the eyes of the men who played it. I recommend it highly and re-read it every view years.
Baseball as it should be, always!: Words alone cannot describe what I have read. Smoky Joe Wood, Rube Marquard, Wahoo Sam Crawford, and many others. We are talking legends of a game gone by. True hero's when a baseball world needed hero's. Many thanks to Lawrence Ritter for capturing moments in time with these baseball legends. I'm sure that they all had a million stories to tell, but I'll settle for just the few that are represented in this book. In today's baseball world of outright sheer greed and selfishness, it was so refreshing to hear stories about baseball's yesterday when times were simpler and the game was just a game. How I miss those days. How I miss those players. Thank you for a memorable look at a simpler time, Lawrence.
old time baseball: There is nothing better than hearing directly from the people who are part of history. This is a great collection.
Incredible.: Any true baseball fan must read this book. Ritter's recordings truly represent the heart and soul of the game, and show the reader the people behind the heroes. Truly wonderful.
DISAPOINTED: HE MADE HIS SELF SOUND LIKE HE WAS THE PERSON IN THE STORY IT WAS TOO PHONY JUST MY VIEW
The Best Baseball Book - Period: This is, and will always be, my most favorite baseball book ever. Read all of the previous reviews and you will understand why so many readers love this book. Read the book and you will realize why you love baseball so much.If you are debating whether or not to read "The Glory of Their Times" ask yourself this question, do you know who Charles Victory Faust is? No? Then read the book. That alone is worth the price of admission.I have reread this book a number of times and there is still a Germany Schaefer story I love to tell any baseball enthusiast who hasn't heard it. But that is just one of many great stories told by a colorful collection of great players who help make baseball the great game that it is.
Poor writing, bad character development: This was my first and only Fern Michaels book. The writing is so poor it is hard to overlook it and enjoy the book. Also, the heroine comes off as whiny and annoying. I am sorry I wasted my money.
A quick read.....: I was kinda puzzled about the main character (Rosie) being a "blimp" at size 16 when I first started this book, & knew it was gonna be a quick fairy tale when I read that the herroine was overweight, yet had won 302 million dollars in the lottery (even though I couldn't believe she kept the winning ticket under a chair cushion.) I thought the crap that the ex husband got away was above & beyond unreal, only to then be 'rewarded' with 68 million of the winnings for finally seeing the light & realizing he had treated his 'overweight' wife like s&*t for their entire married life. I would recommend reading this if your bored & have nothing else to read.
Hmmm: This book was definitely better than the other Fern Michaels books I read. I received several from a coworker who was done with them and decided to give her a try. This book has a good setup and after the awful 'Hey, Good-Looking', this book was better. I would have given it a 3-star, maybe even 4 if it wasn't for the neatly-wrapped up and cheesy ending (I'd have kicked Kenneth out on his butt at the end and not given him one single cent of my money) This book had potential but was ultimately disappointing. Sigh...
Terrible: I have enjoyed Fern Michaels books in the past but this one was terrible. The whole storyline and all the characters were forgetful. I am sorry I purchased it.
Norma Jean: As someone pointed out Marilyn Monroe (AKA Norma Jean Baker)was a size 14 or 16 and nobody would ever accuse her of being overweight. I wear a size 6 but I am very small boned and short. My sister's in law who are tall & medium build wear a size 14 and they look disgustingly voluptuous while I buy t-shirts in kid sizes.And I also agree that Kent needed some serious punishment. His transformation was unrealistic for a person who didn't have a decent bone in his body.But I still enjoyed the book and got a kick out of selling weeds".
What a story!!: Fern Michaels has done it again!! What an inspirational book!! Makes me want to go out and better myself, for ME. I enjoyed every single page of this book, and didn't want to put it down to do anything else. Well Done!!!!!
My first and LAST Fern Michaels: First of all I could not get over how a size 14 is so obese and disgusting. Give me a break! I also didn't like her style of writing. It was very juvenile and seemed like the book was written over a weekend. It's one of the worst books I have ever read!
Whining Whining Whining: While the story line was good. The constant doubt and whining of both the heroine and the villian were hard to bear without moaning or also whining.
A frightful mess: I have never read Fern Daniels before, but since I got this book as a gift I felt I owed it to the giver to read it. Words are far too cheap to describe how badly I detested this book. If I could give it zero stars instead of one, I would.What struck me right out of the gate was how elementary the dialogue was and how one-dimensional the characters were. Their emotions turned on a dime, and they did complete life-changes from one chapter to the next. The dueling plotlines - from the main character's speedy weight loss and perfunctory slips to what to do with a winning lottery ticket - rang false and made-up to me.There were also too many distracting subplots to even care about, and the gratuitous mysticism was ludicrous.In the future, I will not feel any kind of obligation to waste my time reading another Fern Daniels book.
Round File: I got to page 13 before I did something I've never, ever done before in my long life of reading - I threw this book away.
A promising start, but dissapointing overall: When picking up this novel at my local bookstore, I was excited to get to reading it after an enticing description. Rosie is a character that many people can relate to, obese, low self esteem. And as the villian, Kent was deliciously bad. I read anxiously as to what was going to happen to these characters.But in the end, I was very dissappointed. Maybe I'm idealistic, but the sudden, and I mean sudden change of heart by Kent gave me whiplash. I wanted for him "to get what's coming to him" and have the heroin triumphant and rub it in his face. Also, Vickie, Rosie's best friend has such a minor role in this novel. The character of Luna was hysterical to me.Over all it was a dissappointing ending, but a very easy read. Maybe good for the beach.But hey, it's only my opinion.
LOOKS AVERAGE ON PICTURE: THIS BACKPACK WAS ACTUALLY NICE IN COLOR AND STYLE. HOWEVER, IT WAS TOO SMALL FOR ANY USE AT SCHOOL
Unbeliebably useful/informative: Having used this book while traveling through six Mexican States, visiting at least 28 ancient Mayan sites, I can only compliment the quide as to ease of use and wealth of information. The scaled drawings of topography are nothing less than spectacular in giving perspective, the same is true of the sight illistrations and accompanied by many photos makes this a MUST HAVE guide for the region. Lots of modern and ancient cultural insights.
SKILL BELT SANDER: Seems that amazon has made a mistake and has attached the Bosch reviews to the Skill sander..Its really not that good of a belt sander, the track works only when flat on the floor, forget vertical.But its cheap and you get what you pay for. For the very occasional use its just ok, for any work that needs precision you will end up doing more damage than good and will then regret spending so little.
SKIL SANDER: WORKS LIKE IT IS ADVERTISED WOULD PURCHASE THIS EXACT ITEM AGAIN IF NEEDED PRELIMINARY SANDING PROJECT WAS SUCCESSFUL AND HOPE TO FINISH WHEN WEATHER IMPROVES
Good machine for the price: I only use a belt sander for special projects, so I didn't want to spend a great deal of money on one.This one fit the bill perfectly. It's a little heavier than I expected and it's not suitable for people with weak arm muscles - like my wife. But it really gets the job done and gets into corners much better than expected.
The Other Reviewers are correct, Shreds belts: I figured surely it couldn't be that bad, but I went thru five belts taking two layers of paint of an area about 24' sq feet. I was able to get one belt to last a bit longer by swapping it end for end before it shreded. The drive wheel is shorter than the front wheel and there is a spot where the belt goes around a metal surface...seems to get real hot and degrade the belt until it fails. Otherwise seemed like a nice device with great ergonomics, but this belt shredding flaw completely obliviates any positives. If you do even a rudimentary amount of sanding, the attractive price will be overwhelmed by a gluttony of sanding belts. Given my estimate of the design flaw, I do not see how a refurbished unit would fare any better. I'll take my sander back to Ace and order somethine else.
Shreds belts. Not usefull.: I bought this sander @ Lowe's since I needed it imediatly to replase a 40 year Wen sander whos motor finally burned up in the middle of a prodject. The first belt shreded 3/4" off the inside edge & bound up inside. I cleaned up the mess & replaced the belt. I then rered the manual & verified that it was being ooperated properly & was tracking corectly. I made sure I was keeping it level on the work piece, & only the weight of the sander doing the work. The second belt shreded in about 2 min. of sanding. I then gave up & returned it to Lowe's for a refund. I didn't want another Skill, & they didn't have another brand in stock, so my prodject is on hold while I shop Amazon for a replacment.
Chews Up Belts !!: Like others have said it shreds up the belts like crazy !!After about a half hour of use the filter systen does not work anymore, something obviously plugged on the inside somewhere.Now I have to waste my time taking it back tomorrow to get my money back.Wasting my time and my money by all the belts it ruined.I have other Skil brand tools that work great but do not waste your time and money on this one.
Pleased with the sander: All in all a good sander. Got it to sand a floor we are refinishing. Plenty of power for me. People were saying that they had problems with the sander shredding belts. With this sander I also purchased Bosch sanding belts from Amazon. When I used the Bosch belts I had not problems with shredding. I ran out of belts so I bought some cheap belts from the local home improvement store. That was a mistake. The cheap belts worked for awhile then every one I used so far has shredded. Going to order more of the Bosch belts from Amazon. Those work well. Only other thing is that the sanding dust catcher fills up fast so it needs to be emptied frequently but it's easy to do.
agreed: Beware the Amazon pairing: I bought this hastily and also bought the belts Amazon recommended. To my dismay, they were 21" belts and this is an 18" sander.As for the sander itself, my limited experience agrees with the other reviewers. Sander works great, aside from some belt-eating.
useful and well-illustrated: It's quite a practical book. As a professional make of loose covers I am always looking for new techniques, well illustrated. I didn't agree with all the methods, but on the whole, a useful book.
Good reference book: This book provides me with good ideas and clearly written and illustrated instructions for the slip covers I plan to tackle this spring.
Not Well Thought Out: This could be a great carrier if they fixed a couple of major problems. (These problems are big enough to rate a one star.)The first is the break handle. It is too close to the wheel, causing it to be in the way of free wheeling. It also clicks with every spoke.The second problem is the closing allows cats to escape. The only thing holding the front closed is the single latch in the center. It took my cats all of 2 seconds to find the escape routes and leave the carrier. I'm glad they did it before I got outside.
Cheaply made, does not hold a cat or dog securely!!: I purchased this carriage believing per the product description that this would hold my cat. not a chance, it would not hold anything. Number 1, The material feels like paper and in fact could rip easily. Number 2, the closure is velcro! Come on really? ... and they advertise that this is for a cat. Terrible product. A Rip-off. I cannot even return it and get my money back because i cannot find an appropriate box to ship it in. Living in NYC it would cost me more money to return it!HATED THIS Product!
Not worth the money: Very disappointed. Little assembly instructions, cup holder will not fit, if it is collapsable I haven't figured that out yet. Very little ventilation for pet, should be great for winter. Maybe by then I can figure out how to collapse it to fit in the car.
Excellent source book for anyone interested in storytelling: As a resource for families, teachers, and librarians, this book is readable and reliable. The stories and suggestions about how to tell stories are especially useful. I have used the book for over 8 years in my work as a storyteller in the classroom.
Not a bad song in the bunch!: Sadly, I was introduced to Matt Pond by the OC--maybe that doesn't do much for my indie-cred, but the song, "New Hampshire" caught my ear and lodged itself in my head after hearing it only once . . . The rest of the album is equally impressive: poetic lyrics, interesting melodies and a unique sound. Favorites include the aforementioned "New Hampshire," "Closest (Look Out)" and "Bring on the Ending." If you like singer-songwriter artists like Joseph Arthur or Damien Rice, you'll like MPPA. Do yourself a favor and buy this album--you won't be sorry!
warm, inviting, and a great listen: Matt Pond's songs make feel like I am in the cool northern woods during the summer. The songs are vibrant, beautiful and full of life. Each song is amazingly layered with a huge variety of instruments all converging to create warm and inviting songs. Pond's unique voice pulls the listener along for a rewarding experience. Some songs are exuberant such as "Closest" and "Claire" while others are laid back and meloncholy, "Last Song". Pond shows more variety in terms of tempo and emotion, than he has shown on other releases. However, the artful, perfectly composed sound is never compromised on Emblems. Pond wonderfully drawns in the listener, and the result is quite warm and rewarding.
rad tributes: bradley would be glad to hear this..it's a really awesome cd with awesome covers by all who are on it. i didn't think i would like every song on this but i do except maybe for grayboy allstar's cover of doin' time (it drags on to me). otherwise every cover from jack johnson's "badfish/boss dj" to watts/haden's cover of "work that we do" is awesome. the only thing other then grayboy allstars cover that was a bit of a downner for me was no doubt's live cover..it's an old live cover, you would like to think that those guys could update it in the studio. those are just tiny things though that i'm sure i'll get over, over time. what counts is that this cd is awesome and you should really pick it up if your a sublime fan or even if you wanna hear something different such as different takes on great sublime songs. it's well worth the money.
Good for Sublime fans...Okay for others...: For me, this is a cool album. I'm a long time Sublime fan and I enjoyed hearing these reworked versions of their songs. The most noteworthy songs, to me, are Jack Johnson Badfish/Boss DJ medly (check this guy out if you've never heard him- killer acoustic guitar sounds,) No Doubt's DJ's (good cover,)and The Ziggens Paddle Out (The Surf Band that majorly influenced Sublime covering a Sublime surf song- good stuff.) The other songs vary from Filibuster and Half Pint's Get Ready (Good, More classic reggae sound than the original) to G Love's Greatest Hits (sounds too much like a cell phone ringtone at times.) If you like Sublime, just buy it, you'll get some good listens out of this CD and the good songs certainly make it worth it. If you're not coming into this purchase as an existing Sublime fan go buy 40oz. to Freedom RIGHT NOW.
Eclectic Covers: Not bad! Great mix of funk, jam, blues etc. There are a couple styles of music on here I could do without, but it was worth the purchase! Michael Franti & Spearhead to an awesome job on "What I got" and AVAIL's "Santeria" was pretty emo.
Disappointing: I love Sublime and Jack Johnson and G. Love, so how could I go wrong. Well, JJ and G. Love come through, but beyond that, there are only a couple of good songs. Los Lobos version of Pawn Shop is solid. That's about it.I should say, also, that the No Doubt live version of DJ's is a good track, but has been widely available for years. I found that to be very sad seeing how Sublime and No Doubt were all friends and came up together out of the same music scene. Pretty lazy of No Doubt in my opinion.
it's ok: sublime is my favorite band, so i got this because i saw it at the record store and was curious. it's not really bad, but when i listened to the songs, it just made me want to listen to sublime instead. i think the jack johnson song is mediocre, the fishbone song is total crap even though i sorta used to like them, and the rest of the songs, with the exception of a few, are totally boring and complete filler. the exceptions - the live no doubt performance, because it has the original energy of the song ("djs"), mike watt & petra haden (although i think it's really gay that they say '2004' cause i hate that they're 'updating' it somehow), half pint's "get ready" and the g love song is pretty cool. i'd actually put that one on a mix. it's a neat concept, but, yea i'd rather just listen to sublime. RIP bradley
Beautifully made lamp: This is a beautifully-made, all-metal lamp. Easy to assemble, well-packaged, great switchgear for each of the two lamp sockets. Casts a soft, warm, glowing light. Elegantly simple design, same height as other brand floor lamps which is perfect for chairside reading or for room ambiance. Highly recommended.
A different approach: This book offers a different way to evaluate stocks. Although the book size is average, the time needed to read and understand the book is two-fold. Your entire attention must be available and a two week period must be set aside in order to justify the cost of the book.Overall, it is a very good book for new and seasoned traders. It is also a good book for those who are concidering the transistion from investor to trader. I concider it one of the best books in my financial library.If you concider buying this book, insure you have a new highlighter and pencil at your side. A lot of information is provided and much of it is repeated to insure you understand. But highlighting some information can offer better review for examples.
Bait for online service: The book is too wordy - in fact the same information is more concisely presented and available for free at DWA website. To follow the method described you need to become a paying member of DWA. A free 2 week trail is also available at the site. This allows you to findout that to really understand and apply this method you need to take several of the $150 classes that DWA also provides. Also, the online service is really geared towards stock brokers (investment advisors).Use the online course - its faster, cheaper and better.

Technical Analysis De-Mystified - Not: The other review on this date (wentraub) is not a book review but some random thoughts on investing.

A Rhino Dissapointment-Very Incomplete: What I have come to expect of Rhino is thoroughness, and this CD certainly is not thorough, although what is here is of course done very well. Where are the hits Half the Way,Why have you left the one you left me for, etc? I think this could have been a great collection if made longer, or possibly even a two CD set, although maybe they figured nobody would spring for that......too bad, it remains a "couldve been great"......
Very disappointing collection from Rhino: Im surprised Rhino would put out anything but a complete collection spanning all of her labels......country stars are notorious for jumping from one label to another, which makes it hard to get all the hits in one place. This CD covers her later, WB years, with "Dont It Make My Brown Eyes Blue" thrown in for gravy. Nothing from her Columbia years, or her first big hits from United Artists. The majors labels could make a collection this bad, so why should Rhino sully their sterling reputation for quality with this garbage? I dont know, but I hope it isn't a sign of things to come......
Highly recommended: Founded in 1802, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point is one of America's oldest and most respected military institutions which has prepared young men (and recently, young women) for careers as officers in the United States Army. In 2002 West Point celebrated its bicentennial. In honor of this milestone, the USMA Department of History hosted a multi-disciplinary conference focused on the Academy and its place in American society. The topics ranged from the Academy's role in developing officer professionalism, to its influence on the careers of distinguished graduates, to institutional challenges and changes, to the experiences of women and minorities at West Point, to the evolution of the Academy's academic curriculum. A highly recommended and scholarly contribution to American Military History collections, the twenty-four chapters comprising West Point: Two Centuries And Beyond shares the richly informed and informative scholarship of that bicentennial conference.
GREAT BUY: NAUTICA IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE WATCH BRANDS BECAUSE THEY PUT A LOT OF QUALITY INTO THEIR FAIRLY PRICED WATCHES!THE ONLY ISSUE THAT HAD WITH THIS MODEL WAS THAT THE ORIGNAL BAND WAS TOO SMALL FOR MY WRIST...I CHANGED THE BAND TO A BLACK GATOR SKIN W/ WHITE STITCHING, REALLY BRINGS OUT THE DETAILS OF THE WATCH FACE!
Broken clock; good service followup: The clock quit working after 18 hours. I contacted the company. They replaced the item immediately. Replacement clock seems to be working fine.
Ibn Saud: King by Conquest: I was drawn to this book because I know the author and his life story. He has produced a well-written, very detailed account of Saudi history. If you want to understand the current Near East situation read this book. Not only is the chronology carefully observed, the in-depth analysis of the important individuals is revealing. Many books have been written about these subjects by Arab authors as well as others of several countries. I believe this one is the one to read.
I would not call rail "kit"!: Bought back in 2007 and need to install now. Just found that it came with only two pieces and no support for the mattress. I would not call it rail kit---simply misleading. Just call it rails and note that you need extra support for mattress!
Great Songs, Could Use A Little Work: I loved this CD, but I dunno. Some of the songs I had to skip because I hated them so much. My faves wereCaramelGet The Party StartedFamily Affair
There are problems with pop music today...: I can safely say that almost all of the music on this CD is meaningless. People should listin to music based on the music, not how hot the people are, or how popular the music is.What saves this from being a 1 star album is the recordings by U2, Aerosmith and Lenny Kravitz.
WHAT HAPPENED???: What the producers of the NOW series need to do now is put out NOW 10 and be done with it. This CD is worse than NOW 2, and that's pretty bad. NOW 9 seems to have every overplayed song on the planet the last few months and have either edited it to leave no content or just played it again to be annoying. I am so sick of most of the songs on this album that I cannot wait until "Totally Hits 2002" comes out. The only good songs are at the tail end of this album, from Aerosmith to Adema, and that is IT. Pink's remix is just plain bad (don't worry, the original is featured on "TH 2002"), Ja Rule's song is tired, Mary J Blige's song is WAY TOO overplayed, and Mr. Cheeks shouldn't even be here. Save your money for a better CD. NOW this is what I call terrible!
Good compilation, but not great to dance to: This cd has a nice variety of tunes...but If you prefer continuous, beat on beat dance mixes like they're heard in dance clubs...the absolute BEST c.d. you can get right now is Louie DeVito's Dance Factory. In my opinion...it's hard to dance when the music goes fast one minute and slow the next...and Louie DeVito's c.d.'s are mixed by one of the best dj's out there...BAD BOY JOE. And the DIFFERENCE is definitely IN THE MIX!!
Useless...: The NOW series is a cute compilation with the latest chart-topping hits. The songs are mostly bubblegum pop with a bit of radio-friendly rock thrown in for good measure. But what's the point? You hear each song almost every day on the radio...who needs more Britney Spears anyways. With music-downloading software like Kazaa and Morpheus, you could easily get this pop drivel for free. I don't see any point in showcasing songs that will be forgotten by the time the next NOW comes out.Get it if you want to keep on top of the music industry.
GET A CD BURNER: PEOPLE...I would say the cd is aight but they need to put the J.Lo- Ain't It Funny (REMIX), the original version of the song just straight up blows.
The best NOW ever!: I gotta say from all the NOW cd's that I've bought, this is by far the best one. It seriuosly has the best songs of the year and from 20 titles on there every single one is awesome, (except for like 2 of them) The point is that it has all types of music and its worth every penny. I think it's a must buy CD.
Worst NOW album: Most of this album is BORING! Listening-wise, it is. I don't think they sequenced and placed the songs right. There are some good songs here, but the CD drags during the middle, the rock numbers come off very flat on here and it nearly put me to sleep. For the record, Volumes 10 to 15 have really improved in terms of the quality. But Volume 9 is the worst and Ja Rule's lame song on here can't even save it.

It hints at greatness: The Now that's what I call music series has always been one of the stupidest infomercials out there, but many people have dissed on the series. So I'd like to create an alternative:Most of the people who hate this album are like me, and are much more into rock than the r&b;, boy band, and rap that end up on these albums. So there were 2 rock songs. Big whoop. What would be nice is an album, completely made with rock. The problem may be that there are so many different kinds of rock, and some people wouldn't buy the CD because it had, oh, let's say, christian rock on there.(namely Creed b/c POD is tight). But my point is, give the rockers their own compilation CD so we won't have to waste our time talking smack about Now. It's better for everyone.
such a waste if you don't listen to radio: I can only give this 1 star cuz of the ok Lenny Kravitz song, but just about everyone here is just overplayed, washed up, & BORING! Where's the rock here?!?! I hardly think that the tired songs by Aerosmith, U2, & Incubus even attempt to make up for the absence of good rock songs that should be here... don't even ask me which ones, cuz there were hardly any in the first place. The past few years have been a poor excuse for popular music, & I can't wait for rock & roll to come back & kick everyone in the [butt], like it did in the mid-90's... cuz this poor excuse for music is just that, AN EXCUSE!!
Ludacris muzak written by an Incubus that causes Adema: I thought it was impossible, but this garbage is getting worse! This is the most reprehensible collection of Top-40 pablum that has been slapped together recently. Barely one piece of REAL music can be found in the entire CD, what a travesty! The sad part is that some people actually think this detritus is music, not the money making operation of some record producers.
ANY compilation with Britney...: automatically gets 0 stars in my book, but since I have no choice, I have to give it 1. The Gorillaz & Lenny Kravitz tracks are the only ones I even like here. The Smash Mouth remake is alright, but if you think that's better than the original, there's something wrong with you. There's other stuff they could've included here, like White Stripes & Jimmy Eat World... but I'm better off making my own compilation, enuff of this waste of pop.
now that's what i call music! 9: i bought this cd of the now music series and i really loved it.i remembered some of the songs on it and just listing to those songs again kinda bought back memeries for me because i've heard these songs when they first came out on the radio.i like the remix version of Pink's GET THE PARTY STARTED it's just a great song because i also love the original version to. so people who is collecting the now music series and does'nt have this one should buy it because it is part of the collection and to it is worth it.chrisfan.
You call that Music?: I'm sorry I just don't think that Now 9 is nearly as good as the other Now CD's. I mean this one really SUCKS! Out of 20 songs on there I only liked 5. I wouldn't recommend that you get this CD unless you just want the whole "NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL MUSIC!" collection.
It stunk: I hated this cd. My three kids are very picky about their music and they like all of the other nows but this one. My dog ran away when I put it on for the first time. My husband's went to Sam Goody and asked for his money back. Unfortunately, they didn't give it back so he threw a rock through their window. They didn't see, but if you go there, you'll see that the window's broken.
Alex Fire: The purpose of buying cds is to get past the plastic covering of "top 50" tripe and find out where the good tracks are hiding. Every song on this cd falls under the aforementioned tripe labal. If subliminal messages have conviced you that you can't live another 30 seconds without listening to Britney Spears sing "I'm a Slave 4 U," download it off Kazaa from and put yourself out of your misery.When you buy a cds (and you should) at least do it for the artist not the record industry.
ANY CD WITH U2 ON IT OWNS: Well, I'm not a trendy pop music/rap music fan, but, they put U2 on the CD, so it automatically gets 5 stars. With 'Walk On' on the previous Now 8, and 'Sweetest Thing' on Now 2, and now 'Stuck In a Momment' on Now 9, the NOW cd just plain rules. Plus they put on Adema, which is awesome too. I guess I like J Lo's 'Ain't It Funny' and City High's 'Caramel' is cool too. But then they put N Sync and Backstreet Boys and Brittney Spears on here and ruin the CD. But U2 and Adema make this a must have...
Now 9 is the worst Now album: The worst Now album of them all. Should have an Advisory sticker, because they did not edit out the f-word. Plus over half the songs are stupid rap crap. But I gave this 2 stars because of "Family Affair" and "Caramel Remix," the only good songs on the whole album.
all of them: hello i am from cuba this music is the bedt if someone think thaht i am wrong let me know my e_mail is ...
Great: Started using American Crew products thanks to my Barber. Haven't been disappointed yet. Nice smell and great control. Also like the shampoo and after shave cream.
This Is It!: This is the only hair gel product my husband will use. He's been shirking other products in favor of this one for at least a year. It sets his curly hair, keeping it in check, but it is still soft to the touch. Wonderful product.
Great service and product: I received the items on time and in excellent condition. I would definitely order from them again.
Quality absolutely terrible, but fun regardless for Hannah fans!: I have purchased two of these, and neither made it past two days of play, but it was fun for my daughter regardless. The glasses fell apart before being worn, the hair quickly becomes a messy animal, the headband is pretty useless, but the microphone has held up for a couple of months.The bag and mic are all that remains, but I don't regret for a moment the fun we had.The two sets I bought were both blue, but it appears the purple set might be a bit better in quality.
My neice LOVED this: My neice LOVED this. She's a BIG Hannah Montana fan. I loved the price and needed it for free shipping of another item. I haven't seen it yet... but there are pictures.
Daughter wouldn't wear it.: My 7 year old was dissapointed that it the hair was wavy and with brown streaks. She says Hannah Montana has straight blond hair. Money wasted.
a real find for a little girl crazy for Hannah Montanna: Purchased this product for my god daughter who is absolutely crazy about hannah montanna. I was very pleased with both the price and quality of this product and would recommend it for any young lady. This was purchased as a christmas gift and I am sure she is going to love it as did I.
Worth the money: My girls (ages 7 & 9 1/2) loved this. The wig is nice quality and fits their heads well. My 9 1/2 year old wore it for halloween. They have enjoyed playing with it. You have to be careful with it so that it doesn't tangle. The glasses, microphone and earrings are cheap, but they haven't broken. KR
gotta love hannah: my kids are big fans of the show and were hyped to go as hannah for halloween .. although delays prevented us from getting both before the holiday, the merchandise was definitely worth it and they are pleased. the accessories all add to the ensemble and the wig is pretty good. as long as they're happy, i'm happy.
very poor quality: I bought this based on the review info that I read! Boy was I disapointed. The wig will not stay on and you can see the net underneath. It also rats easy
witchy wig!!!: I was excited to get this at a great price. BUT the wig, after 2 days looks like straw. Cannot comb throught the plactic hair. Horrible quality, just go to the wig shop to play dress up.
Items not received: I ordered these items weeks ago and did not receive them by Christmas, nor was I notified of the status.Thanks for nothing.
slightly disappointed: The items in the bag were not exactly the same as shown online. The earings and sunglasses were not the same ones as in the picture when ordering. The same number of items were in the bag, at least. And what was received will hopefully still make our very picky little girl happy.
disappointed: The reason I bought this was because the picture showed a microphone. If you buy the purple one it comes with a headset rather than the microphone. Also the description says earrings - they are for pierced ears. Most dress up kits come with clip-ons so anyone can use them. The bag the kit came in was clear plastic, very cheap looking - and nothing with Hannah Montana on it. I was very disappointed and sent it back!
Hannah Montana tote bag with wig and Accessories: My Grandaughter loved it, easy to put on and her and her sister have had so much fun, dressing up like Hannah Montana and singing. The wig is really very good, it looks so real.
Tired of waiting: I ordered this item for my 9-year old daughter on August 27, 2007 to wear for Halloween. I thought it would arrive in plenty of time, but the date kept getting pushed back. I did find this item on E-Bay Express for twice the price, and I decided to go ahead and cancel my order and order from there. I wasn't thrilled to pay more, but I was afraid that as Halloween grows closer it will get harder to find!
BAD: WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE PACKAGE WIG IS ALL MATTED AND SNARLED AFTER JUST ONE DAY, HEADBAND LOOKS PRETTY BUT COULD FIT A SMALL DOLL.. MICROPHONE IS CUTE BUT THAT WIG IS TERRIBLE ,MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS SO DISAPPOINTED,
wig: I just ordered this wig also, but was afraid it would not come it time. I also just recently bought it at Justice store for 16.99, plus 20% off. I will hang on to the one I just bought from Justice until I receive the one from amazon, or if It doesn't come I will cancel my order and keep the one from Justice. Unfortunatly you can't always depend on internet, sometimes you gotta go old school!
Waited too long: I also ordered this wig back on August 10th. My date was moved several times and I even was promised by Amazon that I would receive this wig sometime the week of October 8th. Customer Service even made up a story about how they had one reserved for me from some "vendor" somwhere. Needless to say I got an email from Amazon the very next day saying I would get the wig in November and I never got the wig. I got the run-around every time I called. I found the wig at a store locally and bought a bunch of "Hannah" accessories. I paid much more money, but I am now guaranteed my daughter can be "Hannah Montana" for Halloween.
Wont be delivered before Halloween!!!!: Hello all,I want to buy this for my daughter just like you all are. I had called Amazon before placing an order, to make sure if I will get this before Halloween. The CS representative said that this will NOT be delivered before Halloween if I placed the order. The earlier delivery date for this item is early November. I decided not to buy this as it wont be available for Halloween.
Wait for merchandise long overdue: I believe every person who has written a terrible review on this product has every right. I ordered this product on August 10,2007 for my daughter to use as part of her Halloween costume. It was a pre-order item before it was due to be released. The shipment date then got pushed to September now it has been pushed out again to November. Needless to say, it won't do me any good at that point and I canceled the order. I went to CLub LibbyLu and purchased all of the items that I needed. They had plenty in stock. Also, as for Amazon and whomever the merchant is that they are dealing with for this product. I think that it is terrible that this item hasn't been shipped to all of the buyers who have ordered this months ago and you still have the nerve to display the item as available!!! At least do what other websites do and mark it as temporarily not available until all prior orders have been fulfilled.
Great product for the price: I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the wig. We bought the Turquoise set and the wig looked great and was even highlighted like Hannah Montana's (unlike some of the others that I'd seen). The sunglasses and microphone worked well for the costume, but we didn't use the earrings (ears not pierced) or headband (I think it'd make a mess of the wig). We bought a fancy top ($7.99) and sequined belt ($3.99) at a discount clothing store and used a fancy pair of jeans that she already had to complete the outfit. My daughter got a lot of complements.
very happy!: Very good quality for the price. We have 3 hannah montana wigs for our daughter's halloween costume. This is the best we have found.
Fun idea, but disappointing!: The wig is hard to keep on my daughter's head. Even worse than that is trying to detangle the hair on the wig. The headband was pretty but useless since it was a very small fit. The microphone pretty much fell apart the first times she used it. After taping it together this is the only items with which she cares to play.
Hannah Montana: What a ripoff! The wig drops hair like a molting dog, the earrings are pierced, (making them unusable by nonpierced girls), and the sunglasses arrived with one bow in the bottom of the package because it was missing a nut and a screw. I DO NOT recommend this product!
Loved It!!!: I Purchased 2 of these kits for our daughters and they loved them!!!! They play with it just about everyday. It comes with cool sunglasses, earrings, scarf, microphone and the blonde wig!! The wig does get messed up pretty easily and it takes time to comb it out (if you can). But they enjoy dressing up and playing with this for hours!I would recommend it for your Hannah Montana Fan!!
good buy: I bought this as a dress up set for my 4 year old niece. Although the earrings are big she loves it and everyone whom has seen it want to buy one for themselves or their children. Good buy at a great price.
Not a big fan: I am a huge fan of Katie MacAlister's vampire books, but just could not get into the guardian books at all.
I refuse to buy any more of her books: I can stand a cliff hanger, I can't stand a blatant attempt to steal my money. This book is an example. Drake is the best thing that ever happened to the heorine (she's so annoying I can't even remember her name)I wish a demon, or the dog would just eat her so the book would end. Don't buy this crapfest!!!!
Aisling strikes again!: It's official! Katie MacAlister is a total tease! I hadn't thought it was possible to improve upon "You slay me" but this book totally hit me sideways.Oh, the fireworks! The chemistry! The utter pizzazz! This book is an embodiment of the phrase "addictive read"! I haven't been so dedicated to a book like I was to this one!Wow! Words cannot fully express just how fun, sexy, and exhilarating reading this book was!My word? Get a copy, read it, and never get rid of it! On cold days, I go back to my Aisling Grays and review them, they'll make you laugh out loud even when you try so hard not to.I absolutely, positively couldn't wait till the sequel.
Total excitement: This was a great follow-up book that left me ready for more of Aisling Grey. From learning more about guardians and dragonsto solving a new mystery. Aisling is a great character, we get to find out more of who she is and what she as a guardian can do,her relationship with Drake gets more exiting and her demon/dog had me laughing to the end. I can't wait for the next novel.
Gotta love Katie MacAlister: I absolutely adore Katie MacAlister and her writing. The first Guardian novel, You Slay Me, had me burning. Fire Me Up was great; however, not what I expected. Although I would have loved to give the 2nd novel 5 stars, there was one major downfall--not enough romance! There were too many dilemma's and characters to really concentrate on Aisling and Drake. But what can I say? There has to be more drama left for Katie's next novels, so I guess we can't have a perfect romance right away. I was also somewhat disappointed in Aisling. Aisling needs to have more dignity and not always go running into Drake's arm. In FACT, why shouldn't Drake come running into her's? Drake obviously hasn't changed. I do hope Aisling wisens up and learns from past mistakes.Katie MacAlister, hats off to you. Cannot wait for the next novel. This doesn't mean to rush the writing; we do want another steamin'HOT novel!
Gave it Back!!!!: I was waiting with baited breath for this book. When it finallycame out I read it in about 4 hours. After I finished it, I took it to my favorite used bookstore and gave it away. I would not even take a credit for it. Yes, I agree that Aisling whines. Part of it is that everyone one expects her to play by the rules but no one ever explained them to her. It was Drake'sbetrayal I could not stomach. I do not know if I will read the next one
More great books from Katie MacAlister: This selection in the Aisling Grey series was worth waiting for. I hope the next in the series isn't far behind. Aisling Grey seems to always get herself in a fix, with Drake and more murders, she is right there in the thick of it. I can't wait to see were Katie is going to take these two in the next book.
Crazy, hilarious and entertaining: I picked this book up from the library and didn't know it was book two in a series until I started reading, but it was fairly easy to figure out what I'd missed in the first book. I found that the humour and the quirkiness of the book grabbed me right away and made me keep reading even though I was missing the first piece of the puzzle. I laughed out loud many times (the Incubi were hilarious, and so was Tiffany the Professional Virgin). The scenes between Drake and Aisling were powerful, but I would have liked more. The mystery over the murders was interesting and kept me reading at the end to find out what was up, although there were some weak points in the story.Definitely an enjoyable read... I'm going to go and track down the first book now for sure.
I Expected SOOOOO Much More!: The first book, "You Slay Me", has some really interesting takes on the supernatural with its totally messed up main character. However, after I read the first book I wondered if the main character was strong and independent, hated Drake, or just hated men in general. The next book, "Fire Me Up", especially the ending, answered the question. It is pathetic. It is almost as if the author is going through an "I hate men" spell.I hope that Katie writes another book in this Guardian series and finally has Al "grow up". Drake's character deserves better. ;) Yes, I know that she feels that he betrayed her, however, it is in his character to make her think. She should have spelled out to him more of what she wanted prior to accepting to be his eternal mate. ...and then to threaten him with another dragon. Shame on you Al! Al is a selfish, whiney, brat who needs to have the tables turned on her.
Great Book!!: I glanced through this book while waiting for service in a local bank. I was so impressed with the pictures and drawings that I am ordering it for my husband's birthday. By that time I'll have found my glasses and will be able to enjoy the words too. Great detail about Nevada.
Just okay: This book is okay, probably wouldn't buy if I would have flipped through it first, but ordered online. Too many examples, not enough explanation on the actual examples. Alot of examples were redundant.
Passport for a job: Last year, I bought this book because I needed to have a quick help to prepare myself for the TOEIC test. Within 4 days, this book let me know enough on the test : typical questions, grammar and possible cunning. I passed the test and get a good score. Thus, I succeed in getting a new job.
OK book but seems hurried: I used this book when working on the TOEIC. The good part was that it doescomprehensively cover the test; the bad part is that it seems like it was writtenin one week. Not very much depth, simplistic explanations, just a little superficial overall. I think there are better TOEIC books out there.
Far-Fetched: I bought 2 videos like this to hopefully use for a retreat we were doing that focuses on Jesus' parables. We found the analogies to be a bit far-fetched and we felt like we couldn't even use them. I do not recommend this product. Had it not had an explanation to the videos I probably wouldn't have even put these videos with the parables Jesus told. The videos are good quality, I just didn't quite understand the content.
Feeder: I like the feeder. It does require that you must take it down to fill it, as you cannot move the cover to the side enough to pour any food in with it hanging by the chain. It is built very sturdy and looks very nice hanging in the yard. It seems to be limited to the small birds, because the perches are very close to the feeding area.
Depressing: I was very disappointed in this novel. I often thought I was reading a native American version of Ulysses without the Doomsday book to explain it. I assume some parts were intended to be comical, but,overall, I found the book to be boring and depressing.
Not Good: The tale was too esoteric. It was very difficult to follow. I could only last one chapter then I was off to sleep!
Jennings Goes to School: This is the first "Jennings" book that I bought for my 8.5 years old son after he listened to the BBC radio program and asked for the book. It is British, funny, he liked it very much, and so did I. There were some words and expressions that I had to explain to him, but he asked for "more Jennings" after he'd finished the book.
Burnham at her best!: I loved every word of this book! I could not put it down. I love the big message in the book about stereotyping. Def. an important message for everyone, especially in High School. And way its addressed in the book is great! Not so preachy but seen from another side.Summer is at an end and Chole's 2 year relationship with her boyfriend, Sean, comes to an end unexpectatly when Sean moves across the country. Now her no longer being part of a couple she starts seeing herself as a whole new person. Her friends on the other hand are pushing her to get back with her ex and try the long distance thing. But is her new found self better than she was just seen as Sean's girl friend? or does it have something to do with the mysterious guy from her fave pizza hangout?I completely enjoyed reading this book. The events and characters are very realistic. And I can not wait to read this one again!
wins for worst album ever: This really is the worst album I have ever hears. I listen to a lot of kids music as my son has been crazy about music since he was a baby. I don't always love it - can do without some of the kids choruses, or the super-happy singers. But this is ten times worse. The songs are trite, and rhyme badly, Donovan's singing is unpalatable, the orchestration entirey insipid. There is one exception -- a woman sings with Donovan on the song "Colors" and her voice is extraordinarily beautiful. And then, unfortunatly, he takes over and ruins it.
Yes, a true travesty: Are you kidding me? These old and lovely songs are presented in a ridulous style. Children are more intelligent than the simple-minded cuteness of this recording. The inclusion of cute children's singing and talking makes this unappealing to an adult. This is not a Donovan album. Forget it.
Doll-sized tea pot: Although the capacity was listed in the specs, it is much, much smaller than I anticipated and looks like a joke sitting on my stove. The color is just as it appeared (to match my decor), but it is too small to be of any functional use. I'm returning it.
hums...but no whistle: I bought this teapot as a Christmas gift. I received it the beginning of Dec., shipped it to my mother in New York to be opened on christmas morning. My mother loved it but said it only "hummed" and didn't whistle but it was okay because she could still hear it from the next room. Within a week, it stopped humming, and of course, never whistled. It was inexpensive...so I guess you get what you pay for. Very disappointed.
drawing table: The table has a nice large surface which is nice. However one side of it was damaged in shipping. I used it for the bottom. The folding aspect of the table is great and really easy to use. It adjusted perfectly to fit our daughter. Overall really nice product.
My Favorite Candy: Sweet and tangy. Original Spree is my absolute fovorite. Great for anyone with sweet tooth.
SPREE: This is the only candy that my granddaughters love & so do I. This was an easy transaction & was shipped on time. ( Or just in time before they came to visit !)
Warning: Item is NOT as listed: We checked this item out from our library and then wanted to purchase.The item we received only has 28 songs, instead of 31 like listed on Amazon. Where are the other three songs?We are very disappointed in this purchase.
Love the music, but...: We love listening to this CD, but we were a little disappointed when we found out that the written lyrics were NOT included. In my opinion, that's a huge part of the educational value of buying a product like this one. The good thing is that I find my 8 year old daughter and 4 year old son trying to sing along anyway and we've only had it for a few days. So we will keep listening because it is fun & upbeat with a wide range of musical genres.
wonderful: Made me take the time out to check my spirit. I really could relate to Sasha?s hurt. Really enjoyed, the ending was very unexpected.
good book: I thought this was a good book. kinda wierd finding out that the twins had two different fathers. But ok...
Great Message: 4 1/2 stars! This book delivered a great message, definitely a must read. Don't bother with book 2, total waste of words.
Thought provoking: I reallly enjoyed reading this book. It provided an understanding to who I am and has caused me to seek a change.
Room for Much Improvement: After reading the reviews for this book, I was hyped for a good read. My expectations were not met. The book was riddled with grammatical errors and changes in tense. The writer's POV was awkward. Sasha's story started out slow, so much so that I did not want to finish the book. I struggled to do so, but did because I had paid for the download. Some of the conflict in the story was resolved way too easily, unrealistic. I would not recommend purchasing the book.
Never got product: I ordered this and never got it. I emailed the seller twice and got NO response Very disappointed. It was cheaper to go to target anyways....
Wide Bra Extender too Wide.: beware: the wide bra extender is very wide. measure your current bra before buying!
Great Little Bra Extender!: My daughter is pregnant and just needed to extend her Victoria's Secret Bra a little. These will fit. We had purchased other extenders and they wouldn't fit and you can't get extenders through Victoria's Secret. We were excited that we found something that did fit and work with that brand of bra.
Bra Extender: This is a must have for bras that are a little too snug, but the cup part still fits. So simple and easy to use. Love it!
Reading in the Labyrinth of Chaos: As I began to read the pages of this book, I immediately began to draw comparisons to Umberto Eco, due to the intellectual flow of the prose. I have much respect for Umberto's work, and Brian's hit me with the same feeling. The only knock I would give to it is the excessive use of "ten cent" words. I have an extensive vocabulary, and Brian had me reaching for the dictionary with every chapter. Purpose and flow are intriguing, and it is a satisfying read. The subject matter is approached very well. This is definately a book that begs to be evaluated by each reader. I would say it is a challenge to complete, one worth noting.
I WISH I could recommend: I searched long and hard for a reasonably priced kettle with the harmonica whistle. I thought I'd found it with the Calypso but unfortunately after less than a month of use the plastic lid on the spout, and the edge of the handle near the hinge have both started melting. And I don't think it's from using the kettle in any other than a typical fashion. BTW for those who report that the whistle didn't work, there was a care/use insert that told you how to adjust the screw in the spout lid to improve the whistling - alas, I won't get to enjoy it after all. I guess I'm going to have to spend the $ on the Chantal model and hope the hot handle is manageable. Maybe you'll have better luck.
Looks are deceiving!!!: I looked for a long time for a tea kettle to purchase for my sister's wedding shower. She is designing a 50's retro-style kitchen and thought this tea kettle would be perfect. Bought this in the summer, because that is when I happened to find this on-line. Anyway, her shower was this past weekend and was I embarased when she took it out of the box and it was chipped. The pink enamel was chipped and I had never taken it out of the box. Now it is "too late" to return and I'm stuck with this piece of crap teakettle. I guess I should have thoroughly checked it out before giving it as a gift, but because the box had a see-through front, the product looked fine, and I never removed it from the box. Companies should stand behind their products if they were shipped defectively, no matter the time frame. I will never buy anything from this company again.
Disappointed: I really needed a whistling teapot because I get busy and forget it is on. Well, I was very disappointed when it didn't whistle. It is very pretty and looks nice.
DON'T DO IT!: Everyone else isn't wrong-it just doesn't whistle.I thought mine would be different, but even after 5 different adjustments, there is no whistle. It's the only tea kettle available in this plum color,which I really want, but it isn't a whistling tea kettle.
the whistling spout melts: This teakettle worked well for a while but the whistling spout cover is plastic and started dripping onto the stove top. Not happy!
Whistling Kettle that doesn't: After waiting for two weeks for delivery to New Zealand I was delighted to find that the colour and style were exactly what I wanted and it looks great in my kitchen. Unfortunately disappointment followed when I found that for some reason the whistle doesn't work. There is probably a very good reason, but when buying off the net and having it shipped half way round the world, returning it to the supplier and getting a replacement is not an option. If the whistle was working it would definitely rate five stars - it looks good and heats water like it's supposed too. Will this experience put me off purchasing off the net again? Probably not.
Cool Sound!: Ok....so I didn't order this teakettle for a long, LONG time because reviewers were saying that it didn't whistle. I thought it didn't make any noise at all. But, I loved its looks so I decided to order it anyway. The yellow color is a buttery yellow. The kettle is good and heavy and the enamel seems to be thick and evenly applied. But the sound....the sound is SO cool! It doesn't whistle like your Grandma's teakettle but it does make a sound. It starts out low and gets louder the longer it boils. It is a low and deep sound like a warning siren. You'll never have to worry about your kettle boiling dry. This kettle will alert you in plenty of time. I'm really enjoying the whole item from shape to color to sound.
Not for gas ranges: It was a disappointment to find this pot was only for electric stoves. I wish the description had said it wasn't for gas ranges. I would have purchased a different pot.
No whistle! :(: We've tried two of these (Amazon was great about exchanging it), and neither one whistles. Seems like there is a design flaw.It's a pretty teakettle, seems reasonably sturdy, and it does its main job of boiling water, but without the whistle, it's not what was advertised.
2.2 tea pot: if you like a smaller tea pot and pink that you can get your hand in to clean this is it. The enamel finish is very well done. Very satisfied
Chip resistant kettle came pre-chipped: Just received this from Amazon. I'm not sure what kind of QA the company runs but I've seen better quality at a swap meet. The kettle came chipped. Not just a little chipped but chipped to the point that it you'd find it in the 95% off bin at a retail store. Specifically, the whole top of the kettle was chipped around the rim as was the spout. In all, 7 chips with the biggest one being half an inch long - seems to me it's a small island and not a chip at that point. This one will be sent back first thing tomorrow.
whistling tea kettle has asthma: The first one we receive wasn't capable of whistling at all (imperfections along the spout let pressure escape).Exchanged the pot, and the new one barely whistles. It's a very low tone similar to blowing into a jug. You might not notice it in the next room. Does boil water, just like the non-whistling teapot we were trying to replace. The whistling is what was desired, and this pot don't play that game.
whistle works but...: well the whistle works fine but the spout does not have a trigger to open it. You have to do it manually when it's hot or the water does not pour out well. Also a big chip knocked of the finish the first month we had it. The best thing about it is the color (blue) and how it looks. But I need a pot that boils water safely and doesn't chip, not just looks pretty. Used on a gas stove the finsih is hard to clean.
AMAZING: This was exactly as advertised and just what I needed. I will get more and give them as gifts because I couldn't ask for more or better!!
Didn't Whistle: I really wanted this tea kettle. So cute and I wanted the harmonic whistle. We've had our current kettle for over 10 years and it still works great, but looking grungy (it was an Oneida and it worked!) It has the harmonic whistle and I love that. Other reviewers said they had problems with the whistle, but I thought I'd try it. Well, didn't work, even after tweaking it. My husband forgot it boiling on the stove because it didn't whistle. I emailed customer service, because I thought they could mail me another whistle part, since it just unscrews. After two emails, they couldn't bother to respond, so I sent it back to Amazon. Good ol' Amazon, but Reston Lloyd sucks. Bummer. It's so cute.
Whistle does not work: This teapot does not whistle and I just lost hard earned money. You could not hear the whistle and I burnt the pot and had to throw it out. Do not recommend this product at all.
Broken: The teakettle arrived with the little tab on the spout broken off. I can not figure out how to return because it does not come up on my purchases at Amazon. Please advise. Thanks!
Terrible...Does not whistle: As many others have written, this kettle does not whistle no matter what you do to try and correct the problem. I sent it back for a refund.
no whistle: A letter to myself two weeks ago. Ahem.Dear Kate, why do you insist on disbelieving other reviewers who say the whistler on this kettle doesn't work? When your birthday present to yourself arrives, you're going to be really annoyed for not listening to the helpful people who TOLD you.No whistle. Lots of steam. Argh.
Doesn't whistle!!: I was so excited to find a yellow teapot that whistled. Unfotunately, it doesnt whistle. If you are looking for teapot that looks nice and is priced reasonably then this one is great however, if you actually want it to whistle this one isnt for you.
Doesn't Whistle: I thought I knew how to put water in a teapot, put it on the burner, and wait for the whistle. I'm still waiting for the whistle. Otherwise, it heats the water just fine.
whistle stop working in 3 months: I later figure out why the whistle stop working. The plastic surround it can't handle the heat, so the shape changed and whistle can't work the way it supposed to.
No whistle: I bought two of these teapots. The one I'm writing about did not whistle and burned up on the stove (my son-in-law forgot he had turned it on). The other one (blue) works just fine, except that it is a little tricky to pour without spilling a bit of water. I'd like the spout to be a little longer and curvy to avoid the spilling. It's definitely good for the price.
Returned it: First off, I have to say that the tea kettle is very cute. The yellow color is exactly what's seen in the picture, and the shape is very nice. Unfortunately, the enamel was already bubbled in a couple places, it flaked off more when the stiff handle was turned, and the lid was very hard to put on. The spout looked fine, but for some reason didn't whistle, which was disappointing since I was interested in hearing the whistle mentioned in the other reviews. It sounded intriguing!The lack of whistle was the last step for me, so I returned it. It could have just been the model I got, but I'm looking for another tea kettle instead of getting a replacement of the same kind.
"Whistle" doesn't work: Looks pretty, but do not expect it to whistle. It whistled the first time I used it - a humming tone, like a distant emergency siren. Hasn't worked since. I think the thin metal reeds are good for one use only and become too weakened at their flex points to stay properly "tuned". I followed previous reviewer's ("researchingmom") instructions for fixing the whistle, and it whistles when I blow it strongly, but it won't whistle under steam power.
Great for girls ages 10 and up!: Christy Swan is starting junior high, on a bad note. She has a bad locker, and her older sister is super popular. Christy is a tomboy, and glad to be until she starts liking the cutest boy in her class. At first, she thinks she should act differently, but she acts like herself, and people like her for who she is. She even wins the part of Peter Pan in a community playhouse production. This is a very entertaining story, about a unique girl. It may sound cliche, but the character of Christy had a very positive effect on me, and I think it will do the same for other girls in late elementary school.I got this book from an order form when I was in 5th grade. When I finally received it, I read it over and over again. I am 22 now, and the cover is wrinkled from use. I still read it from time to time.
Disappointment: As a long-time fan, I wanted one more album, but this was a huge disappointment. Quality was very poor and they spent half the time in unfunny palaver with audience. Songs were not even similar to studio versions.If you have all their albums, don't waste your money on this one. I am giving mine away.Richard
The rest of the story...: A "must have" if you are a KT fan is the DVD "Wherever We May Go" This last performance by them is recounted in the DVD.One of them is on stage alone (I'm thinking Bob Shane singing Scotch and Soda) when the other two decide to head on out to party. Shane (?) finishes the solo and is then left in a highly awkward spot in front of the audience.As I recall, the stranded member was able to give a later payback. Check it out.
Last Round for The Kingston Trio: I guess you just had to be there to really enjoy this performance. I want to see Dean "Mad Dog" Reilly in the chicken suit. These guys were my favorite group growing up and I have heard all the recorded live shows before but this one is my favorite. Sad and sentimental during their last performance? Not really. The songs are really nice but merely interludes between the show's highlight which is after each one when they goof on each other or make fun of people they know in the crowd. Most funny...crowd chanting "more, more!" early in the show and John shouting back "go to hell more"! I wish I had seen it.
Goin Back to Dixie: We really enjoyed the alblum. I only came accross his music lately. I can't get enough of it. It's great.
I'm dancing in Jerusalem!: Hi! I remember buying this on cassette and I really love Lamb. This album is a mix of Christian Comptemporary and Pop. I truly love this. I went to see them years ago and I had a blast with my fiance. These guys truly love God and boy can they back it up, too. So I must recommend this cd because you will think that you are dancing in Jerusalem. Lamb is tops in my book. Buy this cd and give it a try and before you know it you will dancing in the isles.
No Good -- Returned TWICE: Skagen Men's Team CSC Titanium Chronograph Watch #721XLTRBThis watch looked great but came with problems. One reason I got this watch was that it was Swiss. Well, I received the watch and when I looked at the dial to where it was suppose to say "Swiss Made", it was missing a letter "s" so it said "Swis Made" on the front dial of the watch. I returned it and Amazon sent a prompt replacement but that was defective in a different way. The replacement watch had its band fitted wrong so that one of the chronograph knobs was loose and had a gap around it so that stuff could accumulate under the wrap around band. In short the watch looks great on the cover but when you look at the details you find you should stay away. Amazon was great dealing with the situation. I am right now waiting for my two returns from this order to process.
Dry read=Excitement?: This book was terrific to read. I was inspired to buy this book by the National Geographic special on the USS Yorktown. Miracle at Midway leaves nothing out...personal accounts from both sides. It is, however, an extremely objective account. Instead of flag-waving feelings, you're left breathing a sigh of relief. I found the account of retooling the Yorktown at Pearl to be the most inspirational aspect of this book.
Hoody-hoo: This book gives a great amount aof incite into what the battle was really like. It shows you the strategy of both ides and how they were either successful or disasterous. I would reccomend that anyone, with more then just a minor interest in this battle, get this book
Amazing: This is one book that you definately want to buy if you are interested in this battle. It tells the tale of this amazing battle from its roots to the very ending and analyzes the tactics and mistakes. Narrative is amazing and the appendices are very comperhensive.
Gordon Prange-the Master Researcher: Gordon Prange, the late author of At Dawn We Slept, Miracle at Midway, Pearl Harbor, the Verdict of History and The Pearl Harbor Papers does an unmatched job of researching the beginnings of the Pacific War from the Japanese perspective, interviewing many of the participants of the Nihon Kaigun (Imperial Japanese Navy) especially the Kido Butai (First Striking Force). Midway was an extremely close call and victory for the Japanese might have meant conquest of Hawaii and therefore a war lasting some two years longer for America (my opinion). Prange excellently presents the intelligence dilemma and the precise interpretation which presented Admiral Nimitz with his opportunity to ambush Nagumo Chuichi and his four carriers. The author gives credit to the American commanders, Spruance and Fletcher for their flexibility and all the Americans for their courage and stamina. Midway was won by American naval airmen and Prange makes that clear.
The best book on the Battle of Midway: I have read several renditions of the Battle of Midway, but this is by far the most intriguing and interesting one to read. The author writes it like a story and draws you in-it was hard to put down. He has many sources and looks at the battle from both the Japanese and American perspective. This battle was probably the most important one we fought in the Pacific. If we had lost, the Pacific would have been Japanese home waters. The only book you need to read about the Battle of Midway.
Poor quality: I installed this unit in my RV...Installation was easy and the noise level was acceptable....It ran for 2 nights before it seized up...
Good addition to my library & resources: As with any model(s) the book provides great examples of how to focus a conversation and get the results you are seeking.
Great resource: While the ORID method is reviewed here, it's presented in an easy to follow, pratical approach. Great sample conversations and questions are included in appendicies, bibliograpy is rich with great additional reading references.
Broken: Speaker stopped working after only one month in one of the monitors, and after 2 months in the other. It also made lots of clicking noises and fuzz when there is no noise. Our son is only 3 months old, and we are already having to replace it.
I love these monitors!!!!!!!!!!!!!: These are the best monitors i have ever come across, they are crystal clear and i can hear my baby breathing if i want! or i can just adjust the volume to only be able to hear him cry.Have had NO interference and they are so clear when i left the downstairs moitor on by accident one night i thought my baby was downstairs!Love the vibrate function so i can do yard work without worrying, they are small and convienient.If in doubt which ones to buy, buy these!!!!
Poor Performance!: I registered for this monitor thinking it would be a great idea. No cords to plug in, so if I wanted to walk around with the monitor, I could hear it, and I could even have it in my pocket and feel it vibrate. But, it never worked right. I would have to fiddle with the volume to keep it from constantly fuzzing. The vibration was cool too, but that broke after about 6 months or so. I guess I just thought we would get what we paid for, but it doesn't always work like that. I know I won't buy another Fisher Price product again =(
not happy....: I did not purchase this item from Amazon, but I own it and am not happy with it. One the the recievers works fine, but the one with the vibration feature has quit already, I bought this monitor the day after Thanksgiving, and after less than a month, one of the receivers is useless.
Not totally happy: I received this baby monitor at my baby shower and when my husband and I tested it out we were not impressed. The sound is not very sensitive and we get a hissing noise when there are no vocals. We are not sure if we are going to keep it or not. We are not sure why it is so faint, the distance in our apartment is not very far at all, about 75 feet from our room to the nursery.
bad buzzing and vibrator doesn't work: I've noticed the other review that says the reception is crystal clear and the vibration setting is great. I have no idea why, but it doesn't work for me. I've tried both channels and both have a loud static all the time. The vibration setting does not work at all. I wish it did work! But maybe it's something about my home (home wifi network or cordless telephones?) I don't know. But please don't assume it will work for you, apparently it works for some people but not for others.
A problem from the start: This monitor has been nothing but a problem from the day I brought the first set home. I'm now on my third set and my baby's only been in his own room for four months now. Both receivers in the first set made a constant, loud buzzing sound that started the second week of use. I tried both channels to no avail. I exchanged it for the second set. It worked okay for about six weeks. One of the receivers on this set started making a loud sound like an alarm clock that came on and off intermittenly no matter what channel it was on. I exchanged that for the third set. I had that one about two days before one of the receivers stopped working totally. Changing batteries did nothing. I'm now working with a hodge-podge of an old set a friend gave me with one receiver and the lone working receiver from the Fisher Price set. I refuse to exchange it again. Don't buy this model if you want peace of mind.
Disappointed with Fisher Price: These monitors are not worth the money!!! I purchased these locally and have extremely disappointed. The vibrate feature is worthless along with the "belt clip" and so called long range. You can't turn the volume up all the way without being deafened by the static. We continually battle the clicking,buzzing, and neighbors' conversations coming from well over 300 yards away!!! This is one of many disappointing products we have purchased from Fisher Price. I recommend doing some further research before purchasing these monitors
Second receiver stopped working: I received this monitor as a gift for my second baby. I have a Graco dual receiver monitor that I use for my older toddler. I have had no problems with it. The second vibrating receiver for this Fisher Price model stopped working after about 2 months. So now only one receiver works, and I'm stuck dragging the receiver upstairs and down several times a day. There is also alot of static on the receiver if there is anyone standing nearby. I have to be very careful where I place it at night, or we just hear static all night.
TOO MUCH STATIC!!!: This monitor is TERRIBLE!!! All we hear is static. We hate this monitor so much that we are going to buy a different monitor.
Too much static!: We just purchased this monitor and thought it would be great since it has a long range to it - especially since we have a large home. It's horrible! We have the receiver in our room and the monitor portion in the baby's room and we hear constant static on the receiver. When the baby does make noise, yes the monitor picks it up but the static is unbearable to listen too. Our bedroom and the baby room are not very far apart and no matter what channle (A or B) and what volumn level the receiver is at, we still here a contact static noise. I used to have a cheap 15.00 monitor that worked perfect.. I think I'll try to buy a cheaper model and see if we have better luck.
Pretty good monitor: This monitor has done pretty well for us. It eats batteries kind of fast, but I hear that about all monitors. It can be fuzzy sometimes, but I just move the monitor a few inches and the fuzz goes away. I would recommend it.
Nothing but STATIC: I think the antena is too small or something because there is so much static. I am going to buy a new monitor because this one is horrible
Not much to say: I give it 2.5 but I really didn't think there was much of a story here. If you're an admirer and want to read his works, this is an earlier example. Easy, undemanding read.
Butter Me Up: I like to buy things out of the ordinary. This is beautiful. Well made. I always get compliments on it.
butter dish: Impratical design. Very wide, too large to fit in refrigerator door and lage on the table.
Beautiful: I didn't think my family would actually like the design, but they did. I just needed a plain old butter dish that wouldn't shatter. I'm glad I spent the extra money on this. By the way, it almost fits in the clear plastic butter compartment on my refridgerater door. It is only slightly too wide. I keep it in that compartment anyway.
Spot on Promise: Everett does an outstanding job in providing both sound biblical and financial truths. In today's (literally this very day - 10/24/08) chaotic financial arena, it's great to have a perspective of God's unchanging financial principles. For those whose risk aversion is increasing with the financial news in these uncertain times, here is a look at a genuinely "sure thing!"
Recaro too heavy: I'm sending this product back today!!! I thought the Recaro booster seat would be light weight and trendy. This seat was so heavy I could hardly get it out of the box.
Not Enough Depth: This book falls into the category of books that provide a survey of a field, useful for a beginner but certainly not for an advanced network administrator or cabling installer. For example, I needed to send instructions to an electrician at a remote site in Alaska on basic cabling techniques so that he could set up a small LAN using best practices. Unfortunately, this book lacked a basic procedure on how to punch down strands of 4-pair on to a punch down block. Another example, the 568a / 568b issues are poorly explained. Therefore, if you need real, hands-on information for an implementation, then move on to another book, perhaps one from BCSI, or perhaps the Sybex book by Groth and McBee.
Excellent Resource for Network Administrators: An excellent source for network schemes, cabling options and investments in cabling. Derfler's book contains many vivid diagrams of cable and the book is easy to navigate and understand
Great product, but was different color and not clean: I like the product, but I received a navy one, not black that I wanted as well as the stroller was beat up and dirty and did not include all the bars. Would buy the product again, just would be weary from who and would defiantly not buy a used one.
I like this but I'd change one thing!: This is small, easy, an overall a great product. However, it is so lightweight that the slightest imbalance will tip it (this has not happened while the carrier was in place - only prior to me snapping it in).
Lightest double stroller available: It is the lightest double stroller available. It just holds car seats. We have Chico Keyfit 30 seats. I had to add a piece of wood 2x2 across the frame to keep the front of the seat farthest from the handle from falling down too far. That was the only serious shortcoming I have found. The other issue is that you have to take a seat out to get stuff out of the storage area at the bottom.
A nice stroller for twins: This stroller has been great for our twins. It is light weight, easy to fold up, and stores in a reasonable amount of space. The only down side is that there is minimal/no leg space with our Chicco Keyfit car seats, the back seat goes a little under the front seat. It takes a little bit of forcing to get them both in. If not for leg space issues, I would have given 5 stars. I would put it as a must have for newborn twins.
Outstanding Product: Where was this when I was having children 40 years ago. What a great product. My Niece was the recipient and she raves about it. She had twins and the carriage is perfect to snap out and place back in the baby seats. Life is easy when you have products like this that make life less of a challange
False Advertising!!: The product itself is great. Folds easy and weights very little. We bought this for our twins to go along with Chicco keyfit 30 seats. Even though the box clearly states that this stroller is made for those seats, it really is not. You can make it work but not very easily!!
Do not buy...: This stroller DOES NOT work with the Chicco Keyfit or Keyfit 30, even though it expressly states so in the advertising. Even when using the belts as some reviewers and YouTube'ers have said, it is terribly un-safe.
Don't use with Chicco Keyfit 30: We bought this stroller to use with our Chicco Keyfit 30 carseats. The seats do not snap onto the stroller or fit on any of the bars securely. They rest on top of the bars and then you have to use a seat belt to strap the seat to the stroller. The seat belt doesn't cross the seat under the clips and just doesn't feel safe.
Great for a while!: Like some of the folks on here, I have recently begun having a problem with the twins kicking each other, depending on who's in the back. I have already decided that I don't want front/back strollers later, because of this concern, but never expected that they'd begin while in their infant carriers! LOL Up until this point, this stroller has been a Godsend. My guys aren't quite ready to graduate out of the carriers yet, so we have to deal with it... but given the other options out there, I'd buy this stroller again and again.
Ingenious concept: Where were these strollers with my first child?!I love how light weight and easy to use this is. Especially with two car seats, I would hate anything bulky.Because it is narrow (one seat in front of the other), it is easy to navigate in stores, through doors, etc.It is so easy to snap the car seats it, I'll miss it when my babies are no longer in the removable car seats.This is a perfect stroller. Not only is it economical it is practical.
Great product: We got this stroller for our twins. We were worried it wouldn't fit our car seats (Snugride 35) but everything fit nicely. Looking forward to using it this spring.
Does the job, but wouldn't buy again: Purchased this in May of 2011 for our newborn twins. Overall, I'm very unhappy with this purchase, but I do feel we got what we paid for.Pros: great storage (although near impossible to access with both car seats attached) and cheap priceCons: incredibly difficult to steer, flimsy constructionEvery time we attempt to steer this stroller it puts such a strain on the frame, I swear the stroller is going to break. And, as many other reviewers have noted, it has become unusable as the twin in the back seat gets his feet pinched by the front car seat. 4 months of use, and now we need to replace it before the boys have outgrown their carseats. Not an ideal scenario at all. Wish we would have just bought our full feature stroller from the beginning - it would have saved us more money than buying 2 strollers!
Not so great: As a mom of twins i thought this would be the perfect solution for the beginning. And i used this thing for way too long. It is IMPOSSIBLE to steer and you will find yourself straining and backing up a million times just to make a turn. Id say its pretty handy for 2 months max. But you might as well spend $50 more and buy a Graco Duoglider which accepts two carseats as well, steers great, and will last you because its also a real stroller!This double stroller frame is too expensive for what it is (or isnt).
Does not fit Chico Keyfit 30!: This absolutely does not fit the Chico Keyfit 30 car seats. These car seats don't snap into the frame. Don't waste your time purchasing! We had to return.
Misleading Information for Compatible CarSeats: Just an FYI-- The new model number of the Baby Trend Double Snap n Go does NOT work with the Chicco KeyFit 30 carseats. My husband and I did the research for our upcoming twins and everything said the stroller was compatible with the carseats we went with. Thankfully prior to their arrival we decided to figure out how all the 'stuff' we have works. Chicco KeyFit 30 + Baby Trend Double Snap n Go (2012) DO NOT work together!We have tried to contact BabyTrend regarding this problem but have not received a reply.Long story short--- it's a hassle due to the misleading compatibility information!:(For those whom purchased carseats that do work I hope this stroller is everything we were hoping it would be for the early months of your twins. ;)We are hoping to be able to return the stroller somehow but-- since we researched prior to the purchase we have discarded the box and shipping information.
Horrible Customer Service and Broken Stroller: PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. BABY TREND IS A MISERABLE COMPANY TO DEAL WITH.My wife and I purchased this stroller from Amazon.com within the last three months. It pulls to the left when you are pushing it. Not a horrible thing, but still defective. What is horrible is the customer service that we have received from Baby Trend. First don't even try calling them, because every time you call you will be put on hold for 10 minutes and then told by a recorded message that they are experiencing higher then normal call volume and you're hung up on. Second, if after three days of trying like we did and you get through, they'll basically tell you sorry nothing we can do. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. BABY TREND IS A MISERABLE COMPANY TO DEAL WITH.
Never buy this thing: This is horrible stroller. It is very hard to fit two car seat. I tried with 2 diferent car seats and was not working properly with either. I'm so concerned with keeping my kids in this stroller. Make me nervous because its rails are so thin and it seems it will fall down. Yesterday is the first time i took my twins with this. We were only able to put one in this and other one we are carrying in hand.A waste of money....Even after car seats seems upside down.
Do NOT buy: If you have the Graco Snugride car seats, do not buy this product. The instructions for customizing for your car seat are terrible - would it kill them to include some pictures so that you could see what they are suggesting? After setting the stroller up the way it is suggested for the Graco Snugride seats, the seats are not level, and they wobble terribly, you'd never want your precious babies riding around in this contraption. I also tried several other set-ups, and none seem secure enough. In addition, the customer service people are not very helpful.
may not be useful.....: I have read all the reviews and purchased it on 07/07/2010. It arrived on 07/09/2010. I have purchased new Graco Snugride 32 also on 07/08/2010. Just now I have assembled and modified the bars on the storller to fit for Graco. Great all looks wonderful. Here is the catch... after placing both the infant car seats on the stroller frame, I have noticied that front car seat rests on the rear car seat.I purchased this stroller frame with a useful life of 9-12 months not 3-4 months.This will reduce the useful/shelf live of less than 3 to 4 months. After 4 months, baby sitting in the rear seat will be hitting the front infant seat back. May have grearter chances of his feet get stuck in there also. I am wondering how other parents who rated this product are using even after 4 months. I am in delima to return or take chances to see what is the actual usage?
Great for Twins: We are having twins and had the car seats, we just didn't have the stroller. It was cheaper buying this instead of a double car stroller. We have 2 different car seats and they both are stable and worked great with the stroller.
Baby Trend Double Snap N Go Stroller: This is a wonderful item. It is light weight and easy to handle. You need all the help that you can get when there are twins.It was easy to assemble and is quite nimble with double car seats attached.I highly recommend this product.
Great stroller: I've been using this stroller for about four months and have been very happy with it. It's lightweight, easy to fold and unfold (I can do it with one hand) and is very easy to steer (again, one hand). We have Snugrides and they fit well.The only reason I subtracted a star is because the directions could have been a lot clearer. It requires some assembly and the pictures didn't quite match the parts I had. The drink tray wasn't even mentioned in the directions. Now this isn't an essential part and it just snapped into place, but when you are assembling something that may affect your children's safety, you really don't want to have pieces left over.
Does not work with Chicco KeyFit Car Seats: This stroller does not function as advertised with Chicco Key Fit car seats. The seats do not snap into the stroller they just rest on the frame. There are two straps that are suppose to secure the seats to the stroller however they are barely long enough to fit over the car seat and still allow it to slide around. The stroller may work great with other car seats however it is simply unsafe to be used with the Chicco seats.
It does work with the Keyfit 30s: I used this for a good 5 months with our twins and the Keyfit 30 seats. It works. I saw the video on youtube, but I actually put them in a little differently. I put the back seat in first, and then put the front seat in. You have to push it down deeper than you think. It takes a little pressure to get it in nice and snug. But once you get them in and strapped, you are good to go! The seats do not lock on, but you don't need them to if you have them sitting in there and strapped properly. For the price, I got more than my money's use out of it. My only complaint is that you really can't reach the bottom basket very well with the seats on it.
Stroller Does Not Work with Graco Snugride 35 Car seats: Putting together the stroller is easy although I do not like the straps you have to use to securely hold in the car seat. My husband had everything put together within a span of 20 minutes. You may need a Phillips head screwdriver and needle nose pliers if you have to change the bar spacing like we did. Once everything was put together we put in the car seats and the car seat, closest to the parent, almost sits on top of the back seat. It wasn't worth keeping for just a few months worth of use so we decided to send it back. Now our only problem is trying to remove the front wheels to make everything fit back inside the original box. The return process was super easy and UPS is set to pick up the package and bring the address label. Do not purchase this stroller frame if you own the Graco Snugride 35 car seats.
Must Have for Twins!!!: I am absolutely thrilled with this stroller! It easily folds up and fits comfortably in the back of our mini-van, it's even easier to unfold and snap the carseats in...without waking babies up to switch them from carseats to strollers! It steers wonderfully as double strollers go and the storage space underneath is a godsend! We easily adjusted the bars to fit our carseats using the manual.I would reccomend this product to anyone with twins, you absolutely can't go wrong with the price or the style! I would not hesitate to purchase this item again. We have had it for 2 months and have yet to encounter a single problem!
just the mirror, no frame: I was expecting a little frame around the mirror; all you get is the glass and I secured it with heavy duty adhesive but it fell off at the carwash.Went to a junkyard and bought the whole piece for a fraction of the cost of a new one.
Great Canvases!: A friend of mine loves to paint so I always get her art supplies for gift giving occasions. The ones from Winsor Newton tend to be good quality. These wrap around canvases allow the artist to choose whether or not to paint the edges or leave them blank. Gives the artist a little more control over the end product.
Not for the beginner!: I found this program to be too confusing for a beginner. Whole paragraphs of Irish written and spoken by a Gaelic speaker are just too overwhelming for a newcomer to the language. I am sorry that I wasted my money on this program.
Great Information and Examples: If you need to interface Java with MySQL then this is the book to get. As a developer, I like examples and there are examples along with code to study. The fingerprint example shows a great combination of using both web and Java application connections to the database.The book is up-to-date as much as it can be with the latest MySQL Connector/J beta. I would have liked to see more work arounds for featured not handled in MySQL but I guess that's really a MySQL issue and not necessarily the connection between MySQL and Java.
Seriously flawed conceptually.: This book provided a decent walthrough of MySQL and its JDBC driver, however it made some shocking conceptual mistakes. For instance, the "Consistency" principle in ACID transactions has nothing to do with referential integrity, but dirty uncommitted reads. A type 2 and NOT 4 JDBC driver is frequently the best performing type (Oracle's OCI outperforms its Thin and DB2's App seriously outperforms its Net driver). Furthermore, it had one of the most shocking mistakes I've ever seen in a technical book: The "JavaScript" example provided is really just scriptlets inside a JSP -- To me, not even understanding what JavaScript is seriously undermined the credibility of this book.
Above average--in the number of errors: Rarely have I been so irritated with a book that I felt compelled to write a review. I feel that the 5-star rating that the book had when I bought is undeserved. It's replete with errors. Even the URL for the companion website is incorrect. I tracked down the companion website with the help of Google and downloaded the samples, but of course, they wouldn't compile. The authors admit to the challenge of timing the release of book with the release of the Connector/J driver. Too difficult to allow for decent quality control it would appear. Detailed examples can be very helpful, but not when the details are wrong. That just makes for massive frustration.
Best hot sauce EVER!: Try it, you'll like it. Insanely great chicken wings.....rich, smokey, chili.....quick chipolte mayo! I'd go on but I've made myself hungry. Just get some.
Lot's of fake stuff in here: While this sauce is acceptably good, (it's neither amazing nor spicy), it lacks any sort of natural ingredients, having a tiny percentage of actual pepper extract. Lot's of other artificial flavors and colors in the mix. Sure, it's cheap, but you get what you pay for. Try the Yucateco version instead, at least it's more natural, and better taste, too.
Can't get enough!: I have LOVED this band since I first heard the song "Higher". I can't get enough of this DVD. I saw reviews that said Scott's voice was terrible. I beg to differ! The first song was not his best, but the rest of the video was AWESOME!!! I also highly recommend his book, "Sinner's Creed".
Crap: I was excited to get this blu ray as I love concerts in blu ray. I watched/listened to 3 songs and was actually embarrassed. Embarrassed that I bought it and they should be for putting this crap out. I could barely make out a word he was screaming in his off key out of tune "voice". I will just remember them the way they were and melt this plastic in my fire pit.I will add that the Amazon reviews of the Creed blu ray originally led me to Airborne Toxic Event so I bought that blu ray also. I had never heard of them before and my one word review of that blue ray is: Brilliant.
Thought I liked Creed: OK, I like a couple songs. So i took a chance and bought the DVD. Mistake. All his songs sound the same. Is he speaking english? Who knows. I think I made out "with arms wide open" but the rest is a drunken blurr. Guess I dont care for Creed other than his 1 or 2 hit wonders. Maybe they were digitally altered in Studio?
Outstanding: Outstanding!We are Creed fans and saw them last at Meadowbrook.The DVD captures the essence of what we saw: and outstanding performance. We thought the quality was excellent, musically and visually.
Creed DVD: I attended this show when they came to Houston and watching the DVD was just like being there live again. This was a great show!
What Happened?: What happended to the audio mix? Stapps vocals are far to load and his voice is well below par. The soundtrack is edited so much that the audience may as well not be there apart from a token shout here and there. There just seems to be no body, no soul, it's just flat. Great albums but this DVD does not do their them justice. Great Shame.
awesome: Great video. We attended this concert and it is fantastic to have the video to relive the experience.
i wish i had listened!!: i wish i heeded the warning before i spent my cigarette money on this crap. what language was it in?? good question.. actually glad that i didn't understand most of it, cuz what i did understand was amateur, poor front-man educate. i was increasingly embarrassed for the band as the concert progressed, who, each had a "GREAT" performance by the way!! scott was the only problem... and boy was he a problem, especially when he was singing... trust me, i am not being harsh... he was surprisingly awful, awkward, off-key, and off-rhythm; a sensational failure!!
Disappointed Fan: I love every Creed disc ever made. The new Cd is excellent. So, naturally being such a huge fan, I figured why not spend the $15 and buy the new DVD.From the first song I was bummed. Stapp's vocals are horrible. Not only does he sing off key but he is too dramatic in between songs. Obviously, vocal quality will suffer at a live show. But man...this disc gets unbearable. The visual quality is perfect. The audio is a problem. The first disc purchased froze in various spots, then my replacement disc has audio cut outs on each and every song. Stapp does not sound good on the new songs and it's too bad.The rest of the band is tight throughout. 17 songs on the disc is a bargain.Since this is the only official live dvd out there, many fans will still buy it. Just beware that you might be disappointed somewhat.
Tired, dull & self indulgent: Its hard to imagine why the Alter Bridge boys have decided to retrack old ground with Stapp. For the most part his lyrics are lifeless and his stage presence is self indulgent, tired and performance completely forgetable. Whilst the remainder of the band continue to impress, Stapp should hang up the microphone and concentrate on other endeavours.
Creed Live Blu-Ray: The Blu-ray is very good, the HD quality is exceptional. This concert is a must have for any Creed fan
Scott Stapp has lost "it": I love creed and all their studio albums. Stapp's voice is unique and that is probably the main reason why I loved all of their singles.UNFORTUNATELY, I watched this dvd and during the first song I knew it was gonna be awful. Stapp was just yelling with a completely flat voice and unable to hold any notes. He was just yelling/talking to a tune. There was absolutely no range in his voice WHATSOEVER. I honestly would have rather he just lip-synced. His stage presence was great. The rest of the band was good, the production was great, lots of fireworks... but Stapp's voice was horrible. I honestly couldn't appreciate any of the songs. During "with arms wide open" he actually forgot some words and stumbled to recover the beginning of the second verse. Stapp's voice was nothing like it sounds in his albums.I watched it with some friends and we all just kept looking at each other and being like "what the f*"?Stay away from this dvd and just listen to the greatest hits.
which is better: "worst" or "awful"?: reading all the praising reviews at first I thought I was going nuts having an absolutely opposite opinion.this is the worst creed live performance DVD ever recorded (mostly thanks to Stapp's lousy performance), and I really hope it is the last one in the row.actually, the band performs fantastic, but it doesn't save Scott's awful vocals, totally f@cked up mixing and cheap video editing (239 hd-cameras - so where the h@ll they where?).save your money for the next one - it should be better.Houston!!! Are u all deaf there?!I'd threw a few rotten tomatoes at the stage (I'd deliberately miss Mark Tremonti and other guys, if u know what I mean).
Horrible sound because of too much bass sound!: I purchase music DVD all the time of my favorite bands. There are some that are put together right and then there are one like this one that someone did not do a good job editing the sound. There is just way too much bass sound which makes it hard to hear the lyrics that Scott is singing.
LEAVE THIS ONE ON THE SHELF, even for a die hard Creed fan: The quality of the production of this dvd is ok and the band is great (but even better when they are doing ALTER BRIDGE!!!). Scott Stapp brings this all to a grinding halt. He has lost his gift and that is a shame. He once could belt out some great notes but now he just doesn't have it and the addition of the muscle mass doesn't help him. Save your money, if you are a fan of Creed, you'd be better off checking out the Alter Bridge Live from Amsterdam DVD for a truly great concert DVD.
What could have been...: I just saw the HD version of this concert on TV and I just want to know who is the heck ok'd this concert for release?? Scott Stapp is like that over zealous drunk guy trying to sing karaoke...he really tries way too hard with very poor results. It is just sad. They appear to have poured a TON of money into this concert (the record 239 cameras, the stage show, etc.) and it seems like they really wanted to record an amazing concert, but it is just messed up by the vocals. The rest of the band are great and sound tight, the show is amazing...but again, Stapp is just too horrible to enjoy this one. Not recommended unless you are just a die hard Creed fan.
Stapp's voice is horrible!: I painfully watched and listened to this show in awe of how terrible Scott Stapp's voice sounded. I am shocked that Creed would even allow this to be released. It truly sounds like bad karaoke. I've never heard Creed live before, so I don't know if Stapp's voice is always this bad. Not to mention, he acts like a tool on stage. Really a joke of a concert. I like Creed, but this might have been the worst concert I've ever seen. As far as the 5 star reviews go, these people are either tone deaf or it's Creed posting the reviews themselves. Trust me, don't waste your money. It's that bad.
WRONG REVIEWS: What is going on with (weird voice and Jiu Jitsu look) Stapp?Why does this Creed Blu-Ray present reviews about Airborne Toxic Event? * OK, NOW THE REVIEWS ARE CORRECT *
Creed Live: I wanted to take a minute and give some input on the Creed Live DVD. Prior to the purchase I was reading some reviews here and couldn't help but notice people not being satisfied with the vocals so I couldnt wait to see it for myself and I don't get it? The DVD is Awsome! Some people have fantastic voices live, but most don't, Scott sounded really good so I dont understand where people cry about the quality of the vocals? If you don't like this DVD you don't like Creed?By the way, I live in Houston, TX and I was at the show live....it was amazing
Horrible Filming of Creed concert Live, DVD,: I love CREED!I saw them five times! They really know how to rock! But whomever put this DVD together did a horrible job, the Music sounds so bad and very unclear due to the sound recording in my opinion. And there is no bass whatsoever..even after I crank it up on my Onkyo stereo system and anyone who knows Creed, knows they play with tons of bass! Also in my opinion they never properly filmed the entire stage and the back drop of the stage..which was a record breaking stage presence with numerous lights and effects ect.. Creed got shanked! They claim to have 239 video cameras filming but the whole DVD is nothing but upclose shots of Scott Stapp. Which of course he did a great job! In my opinion the people who filmed this DVD did such a horrible job of not capturing the entire stage presence..and all the special effects. Just Terrible! Creed should demand their money back!!!
Save Your Money: First off, I WAS a huge Creed fan.. "Bullets" on Saturday Night Live is an all time favorite of mine. But this dvd is a total waste of money.The guitars are awesome.... the drums rule as usual.... but Scott's voice is off key, and so terrible... you'll turn it off after the opening song.Trust me... you DO NOT want this dvd if you're a Creed fan... it's just THAT BAD!
Dancing Alone book review: I read this book once before but gave it away so I ordered it because I wanted to read it again. And just as I loved it before, I still love it now! It is a great read for those who are born into Orthodoxy as well as for those who have just been introduced to it. Schaeffer's writing is easy to understand and keeps you interested.
Need to have a certain 'righteous indignation' to read it.: I have read _Dancing Alone_ several years back as a catechumen in the Carpatho-Rusyn diocese. It was a stumbling block for me, as I did not feel any hostility towards my background (Methodist), but rather was simply looking for the Truth (and I went searching in all sorts of religions - Buddhism especially was quite attractive, but still lacked 'something'). Perhaps those with a righteous indignation - windmills to attack, or legitimate issues - and there is a place for righteous indignation (or zealotry), and it can be a good thing. It is not my temperment however, so if you start reading this book and find it a stumbling block, then by all means, put it down and read another text on Orthodoxy. But for many, this book has been a help in their journey, and these are my mere opinions, from somebody who really doesn't know much of anything, so take that into account.
What does this book have to do with Dancing or being Alone?: I recently read Frank Schaeffer's "Dancing Alone." I was expecting to hear of his joy in his new faith (thus the dancing) and the sorrow of his possible estrangement from his former extended family of believers and how he dealt with it (thus the alone). However, the book revealed very little of the author's personal odyssey. It was more on the lines of a very long sermon or perhaps, term paper, analyzing the decay of western versions of Christianity and promoting the eastern version through somewhat rose colored glasses.I have read other books by this author, fiction and non fiction and he always comes off so angry. Sometimes humor and pathos is mixed with the anger making him seem more human but not in this book. I was disappointed..
If you're looking for information on the Orthodox church...: This is not the book for you.Mr. Schaeffer is an ARTIST who happens to have a famous evangelist for a daddy (Could it be why he published this book?) with no expertise in orthodoxy.Please understand that his 'expertise' is personal experience. If you're going to read this book, please read it as if you are reading a testimony of ones walk to orthodoxy. His unresolved anger with his former evangelist self clouds his arguements.
Lopsided: It's unfortunate that Schaeffer, like so many Protestants who search for the truth, stop at Constantinople rather than completing the journey to Rome. Despite enormous patristic and historical support for Rome's papal claims, so many move from the Protestantism stemming from the heresies of Luther and Calvin to the Protestantism stemming from the grandfather of them all, Photius the Proto-Protestant. I made the same journey as Schaeffer, at the same time, but I actually read the Fathers and ended up in Rome. A much better select would be "Rome Sweet Home : Our Journey to Catholicism" -- Scott Hahn, Kimberly Hahn (Contributor); Paperback
half good, half bad: When Frank Schaeffer spoke at the Festival of Orthodoxy in Dallas in February 2005, he said that he was too harsh in this book, and that were he able to do it over, he would rewrite half of it. I don't know which half or which parts he would rewrite, but I agree with him about the harshness of his tone, which to me seriously degrades the value and trustworthiness of this book. It's interesting, but Schaeffer's jeremiad makes for wearisome reading after awhile.
History That's Easy to Digest: I had previously read Williams' "Stoner" -- and thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't know what to expect when he tackled an historical subject, but should have figured that he'd get the human aspect of it just right. That's exactly what he did. "Octavius" retells the story of the Roman Empire in the years of Octavius Caesar's reign, following the assassination of his adoptive father, Julius Caesar. The story is riveting -- well told through excerpts from the diaries, memoranda and missives of Octavius and many of his contemporaries. The characters are wonderfully drawn. A very easy and informative read. I have no idea if Williams' depiction of the title character's humanity and personality is accurate, but if so he was a remarkable ruler. I recommend this book highly.
great music for a great movie: i ve just watched this movie for the first time and now i am interested in the soundtrack. some artists i knew, the others i didn't and wanted to know the singers and song titles. the overall soundtrack complements the location of the movie and the action of the characters. i feel like i just visited texas!as an elvis fan, i was thrilled to hear Run On used. but it's missing from this recording. the first reviewer here (from 2002) correctly identifies it, and he also identified the song in the celebratory locker room. for those who liked Run On, there are different versions of Elvis' gospel music out there. As for the House of Pain song, I will be looking for that.i know listening to the cd will continue to remind me of this great movie.
Trailer Song: I don't have the CD either, and probably won't get it - only because it doesn't have LIGHTNING CRASHES by Live (song on the advertisement).
*CAUTION* Swallowed Ball: I was lying down to go to sleep when I felt something weird in my mouth. Well it turned out that the top ball from the tongue ring had some how undone itself, and fell in my throat. This is not the first time that one of the acrylic tongue rings that I have orderd from this web site have done this. Most of them the ball from the top cracks and it just comes off. It's quite irritating.
Fantastic!!: Palmer's lip butter is a fantastic product. I get so many compliments about having pretty lips, & what I use to keep them so soft & moist! When the Walgreens in my area had they were closing out on this product, I purchased every tube they had!! I keep one in the car, my purse, & at work!
Always in my purse or pocket: I was one of those poor souls who was addicted to the medicated lip balms because of severely dry and chapped lips. I decided it was time to wean myself off of the medicated addicting stuff, and I finally hit the jack pot when I found Palmer's lip butter in chocolate peppermint. The peppermint added the little bit of coolness that I need to feel like it's medicated, but not really medicated, you know? My husband and son love the scent of it! When I put it on in the car my 3 year old will always say "mmmm, I smell chocolate, mama!"I love this product so much, that although I'm not able to find it in any of the drugstores around here anymore, that I'm about to order some from the internet!
Winter Wonderland: I thought this video was terrible. I could not believe most of the video was taken from a camera pointed out the side or back of the train and turned on to record. The only good part of this video was the archived footage from the steam locomotives that were included in. This video can not keep the attention of my four year old son who loves trains. I clearly expected better.
This is DVD is boring!: This is the worst DVD I have ever watched! It's very dumb because you are not on the train! It's no fun watching people eat! All you do is watch people do nothing but sit there! I think this DVD is really dumb but you can still buy it if you want!
lifeless and Dull: lifeless and Dull one more time. The masters used for this recording and digital processing just plain ripped the sparkle and air out of these 10 tracks. It's just awful to try and listen to this as I loved Nat style but this will never see my CD player again and let alone be ripped to my computer.Save your money and shame on the Canadian Company, Legacy for surely damaging or at least tainting a great singers work.10 tracks, 28 minutes.
Half Games, Half Comedians: GGW is advertising their Games dvd again, as if it were new, but it is clearly this same old show. This so easily could have been excellent - clever games, naked women. However,(1) Some of the "games" obviously had not been tested: the spinning bed "game" doesn't work, it just slips off and there is no way to judge who won.(2) It is censored - there is very little nudity or shots below the navel. By and large this is a bikini and topless competition.(3) Some of the women are genuinely beautiful, but there are more 7s and 8s than you would ever see in a Playboy or Penthouse video.(4) An awful lot of time is spent without any women on the screen (it seemed almost half the running time) as the comic hosts tell bad jokes.This should have been better.
A must have for any Sport Erotica Enthusiast: Although it's not the best Girls Gone Wild video you'll ever see, it certainly is up there. It is the best erotic sports movie I have ever seen. The only reason I give it four stars is that it is not as good as the commercial let on.The DVD That usually comes along with this is not that bad either. Another Standard Girls Gone Wild vidoe. What I find nice about it is that it dosen't beat around the bush. It gets right to the action, unlike some other naked sports videos. It also lets you see behind the scenes a little wich was extreamly hot and sexy. If you are considering to get this DVD, stop thinking and just get it. You wont regret it.
Not so great: Girls gone wild games takes place on fantasy island. The girls are split into teams and compete for points. The girls are supposed to be "naked" but they are mostly just topless. There are cutscenes interrupting the games and the games really aren't too wild. This old title could be a lot better
Just watch it for the compatition: I did not buy this Dvd just to watch a bunch of girls run around topless. I just bought it to watch the compatition. Because I'am that type of person who will watch any compatition. Like who can get to the rings the fastest. Hope you all understand on what I'am saying here
Great way to clean floors: I bought this a few months ago and I love it! It beats the mopping I used to do. It is quick, does a great job and leaves the floor dry. I tried cleaning other things as it suggested (like the tub and mirrors) but my usual way is better. A little longer cord would be nice.
exactly what I was looking for: I bought this to protect my camera from dust storms in the Blackrock desert. I is perfect for this. It also protected my camera from occasional water spray and sweat. Many people told me their digital cameras were ruined from dust getting in the zoom mechanism of the lens. The buttons are all accessible and easy to use. It's very easy to take in and out. The only problem is you can't record sound when taking video, but what would you expect if the case is water submersible.
single use only: Case worked perfectly for the first few days on shallow dives. Seal wore out after 4 uses. Kinda useless then isn't it? Also, cannot find replacement seal.
PowerShot Underwater Case: I purchased this case mainly for a trip to St. Lucia for snorkeling. It was wonderful! Easy to put the camera in, and very easy to use. Took wonderful underwater pictures during snorkeling trips. My grandson (7) also has taken fun pictures with it in a swimming pool. Only thing I have to remember is to wipe the front of the case when getting out of the water before taking land pictures. Would highly recommend this even for rainy days and beach excursions.
Not for Diving!: If you would like to take a picture of the bottom of your pool, this product is awesome. Otherwise, it's pretty useless. Why does Canon only deliver 100-foot rated underwater cases for SOME of their cameras? I made the mistake of buying the SD450, and am now stuck with a camera that cannot be used for diving... unless you're will to risk taking it down in this POS case.
Good Deal: I received my book a few days before my class started. It was in good condition and fairly price for being brand new. In my University book store it was priced over $120 so i think I got a pretty good deal. I did hear something about a CD but mine didn't come with one, but it didn't matter because I didn't need it to meet my course requirements.
Depending on your political persuasion: "It is neither honest nor objective to describe popular teaching practices in a neutral manner if they do not stand up to the standards of social justice or education research. We do not believe that the world is a neutral place or that teaching is a neutral profession." Introduction to Teaching, etc.Be forwarned that this is not a textbook that even tries to be objective about the history of teaching and learning. It is vehemently anti-traditionalist, and glowingly pro-constructivist.For traditionalists or people looking for a balanced view of the history of American schooling, this work rates 1 star.For constructivists or marxists this would be a 5 star.
Great reference: I thought it was a great book, that deals with some very complicated amd interesting subjects in a nice and "user friendly" manner. Nonethdless I did find it a little bit repetitive to the end. Still, great book. Highly recommended!
This book is must for System Administrators and IT Managers.: The Art Of Deception is a fairly good book especially if you are holding key position in Information Technology. This book will provide you examples of social engineering that can lead information theft. This book provides the information on all the aspects that needs to be taken care of, if you plan or implement network security. However, people looking for technical details will be disappointed, as it does not provide any technical information or way to protect or safeguard corporate information.I like this book because it takes your attention to places that are ignored by many people. Remember, installing and configuring Firewalls, IP Sec, and Encryption is useless if you leave your server room accessible. That's exactly what this book tells. Having $ 100,000 technology is not enough to protect your information if you are careless about the information that a social engineer can use to break that technology.This book is worth buying.
He's just a grifter: There's no technical knowledge here. Just a con artist conning you out of a few more bucks. Yeah, he's smart, yeah, he's clever. But he's not a hacker. Do your self a favor -- put some Scott Joplin on the stereo, and wait for this to be remaindered.
Mitnick was never a wiz kid - he was a criminal though.: Hmmm. Amazon seems to have deleted my earlier review - I'll make it short. Mitnick is not a great hacker, he's a con artist. After reading his book there is virtually NOTHING about protecting yourself from hackers but maybe some ideas about protecting yourself from ex-convict con artists.
Profit from crime: Don't forget, when you buy this book, the author is profiting from the crimes he commited. It's like buying a book by Jeffrey Dahmer on how not to be murdered. Criminals should not profit from their crimes. If you feel you /must/ read this book, check it out of the library.
Kevin Mitnick Book: I'm sorry, but a book by an ex-hacker who got caught in 1981 isn't my idea of hacking educational material. Those who know Mitnick's background know exactly why he is being pushed upon us as a 'reformed' expert hacker. A 'hacker' who last practiced his criminal behavior in 1981 knows less about today's technology than an AOL user does.
Mitnick sticks to his guns: Mitnick never described himself as a "hacker" but rather a "social engineer". Good at it and well articulated in this text. Shame a crook can make so much ill gotten gain from being good at his illegal endeavors
The Art of Deception ...: Mitnick shows that he is a master of the obvious. Guess what? Untrained users are the weakest links in your company's non existent security policy. The book is a set of long rambling stories about fictitious amateur con artists designed to be thinly veiled as Mitnick's own personal conquests... There isn't anything in this book that would help anyone but the truly clueless and seems to be written for young misguided computer enthusiasts.
Too corporate self-help: Kevin Mitnick was a gifted social engineer, so I was looking forward to reading about the tricks he'd used. Instead, I was disappointed to see the book is totally geared to the corporate director that has NO clue about computer security. The vast majority of the 'lessons' are embarrassingly common-sense:- lock your computer- don't write down passwords or codes- don't give out confidential information- check everyone's creditentials or IDThat's about it. Of course, you're missing out on the pages upon pages of rehashing the same lessons over and over, but if someone needs that kind of reinforcement to learn, maybe they need this book. :)
Quite trivial: I purchased this book based on several reviews including the few in amazon.com. What a disappointment. The book is a compendum of anecdotal evidence presented as "true stories", all of them of varying degrees of credibility.All the stories can be summed up in two words: identity theft. each story is told twice, once as Dr. Watson would have seen it at first, and once as Mr. Holmes would have explained it.At the end there is a review of what are the "best practices" of security, which is quite superficial to be interesging or valuable. All in all, the Sherlock adventures are a better reading; and a serious approach when drafting a security policy would be more useful than wasting time on reading this book.Get it from the library.
extremely boring... nothing in here about hacking: extremely boring... nothing in here about hacking or protecting yourself from hackers...very dissappointed. waste of my time and waste of my money
Great Book for anyone intrrested ins ecurity or people: This is a great book, ti is filled with great stories, preventitive mesures, and more. This is a very easy read, and will be well worth the price fro anyone intrested in security, computer security, corprit security, or how people think, and how socity is flawed. If you are not in a buisness, or a company where this is usefull, then you might get boared with the ammount of talk on hwo to implement security into a company, but even still, it is a great book
Common sense: I just finished Kevin Mitnick's Art of Deception. I started the book after I saw 3rd episode of The Broken and a friend told me he has just bought a copy while visiting London.I expected an eye opening and high-tech hacker book, but I was very disappointed. In his book Mitnick lists plenty of social engineering stories, couple of which do represent a fresh way to look at things, but after reading couple of them, he just starts to repeat himself. Another disappointment was that there are absolutely no practical hacker hints or tricks and almost no computer related stuff in this book. After every story Mitnick gives advice, but that is typically just common sense and I have doubts how his methods of keeping a company safe of social engineers could be practical in a professional world.So, if you don't have any other idea what to read on the beach this summer, you can grab a copy. But if you are into computers and over 14, you'll probably struggle to read the book to the end
Not bad - Social Engineer = con man: I think he's right that technical hacking is mostly not terribly useful without being able to con the marks. Guy's a con man who knows computers a bit. Screw this "social engineering" bunkum. It's the art of the con.I'd sure think twice before hiring him. How do you know he isn't casing your joint thinking about how to use what he learns? I'd say it's pretty unlikely he wouldn't be. On the other hand, ol' Kev' making an honest living making more money than a conman can could be a help for us all. I just have to wonder if a guy like him is capable of learning.Kept thinking of "Stainless Steel Rat is Born" by Harrison reading his stuff. A lot of similarities, including Kevin has provided us with a lot of entertainment, which was one of the Rat's reasons.Also kept thinking that maybe I oughta write a book. Used to do breakin scenarios for a bank. Kev' and his pals could learn a few things.
Great Book...a must read: I am a Private Investigator by profession for over 25 years...and this book still had some eye openers and tips and tricks I have picked up on and used.Get this book and read it.Kevin Mitnick is a smart guy who pushed the envelope, but he has made a fortune since he came over from the dark side.Fun and entertaining reading, and it may scare you.
Packed with Knowledge!: In The Art of Deception, Kevin D. Mitnick, a corporate security consultant who was once arrested for computer hacking, has written a fascinating book about how to control security lapses due to the "human element." With writer William L. Simon, he describes how con artists use social engineering to gain information by lying to pass themselves off as insiders. By being sensitive to human behavior and taking advantage of trust, they learn to bypass your security systems. The book teaches you how to ward off such threats and educate employees. Yet, problematically, this information could also help con artists be more sophisticated. In any case, this highly informative, engaging book includes sample conversations that open the door to information, along with tips about how various cons are used and what to do about them. We from getAbstract recommend this book to corporate officers, information managers, human resource directors and security personnel, but don't tell anybody.
Better Than I Expected: I expected a light read of the same genre as Cyberpunk... the other side to this interesting story. Instead, what I found was valuable information worth keeping. It is as well written as it is informative, and is worthy of consideration for permanent shelf-space.
Nice: Interesting book. If you are bored or just need a book to read, read this one. It can provide some incites
A school teacher for social hacking: In "Ghost in the Wires" Kevin Mitnick referred to its previous book, "The art of Deception". I started to read it as the first fascinated me.Kevin as an artist in social engineering hacking. Most of his tricks would have fooled me with no doubt.In the "Ghost in the Wires" book, Kevin wrote that this book was learned in universities in security classes. I surely understand why. It is written with an example of a con and then analysis how to protect by it.The book is split into chapters with similar cons and is very attractive for teaching classes.The cons are marvelous, but most of them are appearing in "Ghost in the Wires" so I was acquaintance to these tricks.This book is a must for security personals. To enjoy the experience of a life of a hacker I recommend to read the "Ghost in the Wires"
A Real Eye-Opener!!: Overall I'd say this is a must-read for anyone interested in corporate data security. It definitely gets you thinking about the vulnerabilities in your company. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because if anything it give TOO MANY examples of how social engineers can fool people into providing seemingly innocuous information and use it to achieve ther goal. If you are in IT or care about your companies data security, READ THIS BOOK!!!!
Good read, very interesting, somewhat repetitive.: I was in shock after reading the first couple of chapters. I now have a completely different look on security. After reading this book you will see how easy it really is to get someones password, or get a business's internal phone directory with a phone call or two. This book is a great guide for creating a security policy within your company. After every "story", Mitnick provides his advice on how this was accomplished and what you can do to stop it. The only problem with the book is that Mitnick's solutions to these problems are almost identical in every chapter, just with different wording. Once you understand this, you will probably skip his advice on the last few chapters. Overall a great book though!
Amazing: This book is filled with information that you would not believe. I never read books ever, but this is one of the few exceptions. It is truly amazing!
Dated Material: The book was OK but it's a few years old. The techniques the author used to defeat computer networks and the people that use them have changed a bit. Interesting stories but not as relevant as they were when he wrote them.
If you dont think you could be a victim, read this to have your eyes opened: This book is geared towards BDM (Business Decision Makers) who need to decide if and how they should secure their assets. If you live or work in an environment that is still unsure if they need to protect themselves in this way, then you should absolutely read this and share it with other decision makers. Hopefully it will open their eyes to the dangers of information leaks.While the book is a bit dated with all its talk of security your incoming analog modems, it is an easy read with good examples of discussions and sceneries that at face value might seem harmless, but when collected in the larger attack scenario become important pieces of the puzzle. This book is essentially a series of anecdotes about social engineering attacks from multiple perspectives. This makes it useful since this presentation provides both the attack and the reasons for choosing the method of attack.
PERFECT FOR WORKING OUT: Perfect for working out. People need to stop complaining in the reviews above. Its so cheap you can't expect it to have many features. Great for working out. I am a very athletic person that is always bouncing around throughout the gym. They never fall off, are comfortable for the entire workout and I have even ran in the rain with them. No wires to deal with and the battery life is great and takes only one AAA. They are discontinued so find them while you can.
Great idea, bad execution: Multiple problems with these headphones. I use them for voice tracks so I have no comment on sound quality. There is no display so there is no way to know what is happening with the system when you press a button. There is no repeat function. The headphones will only play one track over and over again -- I can't forward to another track. I'm very displeased and am going to return them.
Limited Usefulness: I bought this headset to go jogging with. I can't use it for that, or for much else. There is no way to put a "playlist" on the player, so any songs you put on the player seem to play in a random order. Also, I can't download my Audible.com audio to it, and it's not a device recognized by Napster to Go (the legal way to put downloaded music onto portable devices). Beyond that, the design of the phones hurts to wear for more than a short time, and even though they're touted as "sports headphones", they don't stay in place well while jogging.All that being said, the sound is good, and the price is cheap, so I'll probably end up keeping them because of the wireless convenience of listening to a few tracks in a random order for a short time. Grrr.
Not for Naval Architects.: This book is mainly written for the general people who have no any basic ideal in ship hydrodynamics.
This Edition...: My review is not on the content of the play, but on this particular edition of the play.I know everyone has their own reading style, so this may not bother everyone. However, when I'm reading an older piece of literature, I enjoy looking at footnotes. I'm sure that some skip over them, but I do not. In this edition, however, the footnotes were there, but there were no indications in the text to let me know when to look at the footnotes. The only indication was the line number, which was written right before each footnote. This was irritating to me, and so I went through the whole play ahead of time and marked the parts where I had to look for footnotes, which was very time consuming.I would definitely recommend reading the play, because it is very funny and there are a number of interesting literary devices going on that I won't go into here, but I would not recommend this particular edition (New Mermaids).
The Haunted, a True Story: This movie is titled 'Haunted' starring Aldo Ray, but the description is for the movie 'The Haunted, A True Story' which was a made for TV true story based on the Smurl family, starring Sally Kirkland and Director Robert Mandel. Just wanted to clarify this so people know which movie they are buying. P.S. If anyone has this movie available, please list it.

This book can help every person make positive changes that will affect the quality and length of his/her life.: "Natural Cures from a Real Medical Doctor" is an excellent book which can serve as a good review for people who are health-conscious and be very informative for those who are not as knowledgeable in this area. This book is a quick read and can surely motivate anyone to start making life changes. Since I read the book, I've definitely been more careful about what I'm eating, and I plan to refer to the book periodically to help keep me on track.
This is the real deal!: There have been books published in the past that have attempted to offer natural cures but this tiny book is the real deal! It doesn't tell you what you need to take to cure yourself of disease but rather it tells you what to take and do on a daily basis to stay healthy and prevent the disease from occurring in the first place. Best of all it's written by a credible doctor!I definitely recommend this book to everyone! It is a must have and is quite an eye opener!
Are You Kidding ?: Dont smoke, drink, eat bad food, loose weight and dont get stressed out. Thats the book in a nutshell and he is the best in the buisness ? If you want some interesting reading, research Leptin books on amazon.
Shorter than a children's book and nothing new: I read this leaflet in less than 20 minutes. It didn't tell me anything new either.
A Thin Booklet: I expected to get an actual book; this is a thinnish booklet of the type found on wire turn-arounds in health food stores. So I was disappointed; however, my sister says its a good summary of current knowledge on the subject and she's very informed in this area.
NOT ACCURATE: I have read this book and found it to be inaccurate since the some of the information is in error. The chapter on fixing your credit is completely wrong. He says if there is 0 information on your report theirs nothing you can do about it " not true" I have used credit repair companies with success and will tell you they work wonderful. Most of the stuff he talks about - such as the Statute of limitaions applies to very few people. And the chapter on grants is good but Mathew Lesko has better informtion on that subject. This guy can sell ice to an eskimo and is getting very rich doing so. How do these guys get rich..... "selling books" He gets one star and thats being generous!
Incorrect Info: I had to return this item. Description stated 18 inch toy, however when I received this item it was a small 6 inch McDonalds toy that they used to give out in Happy Meals. Amazon was very helpful with the return.
A must for every collector: This elephant is absolutely amazing! Yeah, its not the Beanie BABY, but, its still worth it. She is soft, and fluffy, and amazing in every way. I dont usually take my beanie babies with me, but she will come with me wherever i go!
Not worth this price tag.: This product has a lot of quality and it's all low. For the price of this you could get 3 buckets of chocolate ice cream from a grocery store, eating the ice cream would be more enjoyable, and it would take longer to eat it than it does to watch this DVD. Additionally, if you gained some extra weight and want to remove it, you can just go to the gym, but the time wasted on this DVD cannot be recovered.
Cheap Burned DVDRs: This show is not the quality of other more famous shows available on DVD. The DVDs are poor quality DVD-Rs (burned discs) in cheap thin packs with copied inserts. I purchased this show and it didn't work on my Sony 200 disc DVD player because it was a DVDR - I had to return it to Amazon. [...]. People who are thinking about purchasing this series should know that it is not as good as others out there. Save your money.
Even Worse: This was even worse than the first season. What happened, did your camera man find another job and take his camera with him? And you can't even afford a DVD case to send this in? I got this in two blank jewel-cases and the title was hand-written on the DVD in marker!Chris, just admit it, you have no talent, that's probably why you dropped out of film school. Go do something else with your life other than pretending you can act.
Good gate for pets: This is a good gate for wide openings. It keeps by dog from scratching at my kids bedroom doors. It is easy to put up and take down. It is also a perfect height because when I don't want to take it down I can easily go over it. I highly recommend this gate.
Broke on third time!: The third time I went to latch this gate in to place it busted in two. I was very disappointed and should really send it back.
THIS SHOULD BE RECALLED! GATE IS A DANGER TO CHILDREN!!!: Our 22 mo. old threw his blanket over the gate and tried to retrieve the blanket and got his hand stuck in between the squares, and I mean PAINFULLY stuck. Thank God I was able to gently get his hand back out. I later had my husband hold 2 fingers in the square (3/4 the size of the regular squares) where our son had his hand and I then attempted to unlock the gate and just the motion of unlocking the gate COULD HAVE created the space smaller, pinching into our son's wrist even more. THERE ARE NO WARNINGS ON THIS GATE ABOUT SMALL CHILDREN GETTING THEIR HANDS OR FEET STUCK. It is common sense though and one would think that a child would be able to bring their hand back out. But because he got it between the end where the gates overlap, the area was smaller. I see the far edges are smaller too. I wouldn't even trust this gate for an animal. I will be calling the company the next business day.
Dangerous and doesn't work.: Do NOT buy this product. It's flimsy and doesn't work. There are set notches, you can't just adjust it to whatever size you need. While all our hallways and doors are standard sizes, this fits in none of them. The rubber ends aren't even, so you can't get it to hold firmly at all. When the top one is tight, the bottom one is too loose and there's nothing you can do to adjust that. My girls got the gate down in a matter of seconds and they're not even walking yet. I had it in as tight as I could get it. Another time, I had tightened it and it came down and scraped my ankle when all I did was walk past. Imagine having a baby or toddler pulling up on it. What kind of harm can it do them? NEVER use this product. Ours is going back asap.
Don't buy this, doesn't hold tight and fiddly to use.: My 8 month old was strong enough to pull this down, even when I had it adjusted so tight the center beam was bowing. It doesn't have a way to adjust or tighten the gate after setting it between walls or in a doorway, so you have to guess at the adjustment and then try to shove it in place. Not fun.The wood is also pretty light and flimsy, and I don't trust it.
Great product, good price: This was the second Evenflo gate I have purchased, the first one now about 14 years old still in good condition. The gate expands with little difficulty and is high enough for keeping my Alaskan Malamutes in specific rooms. The gate is easy to clean. It is also a nice height to keep our toddler grandkids safe, away from stairs. The price is well worth the durability and function.
disappointed in gate; poor packing/shipping: Gate was shipped in original manufacturer box which does not have any additional packing material. Box arrived damaged and gate was slightly warped. Gate itself is cumbersome to setup and to use. Gate is too tall for most people to climb over, so it is not good for high traffic area. It is, at best, only for an area where you would set it up and not take it down regularly. Ended up buying another metal gate that has a swinging door - 2.5 times the cost but much happier with that one.
This gate is useless: Do not buy this gate unless you want an inferior product. I could not have been more underwhelmed by a product. In fact, this gate is potentially dangerous and should be taken off the market. It does not work.
real gritty rock from the 60s: If you want real 60s music, then get this.This is real basic 60s rock . I love the 60s music and the people who made it (ie the Beatles when in Hamburg, the Pretty Things, the Animals etc) but their music has been smothered and derided by the PR executives with their blinkered adherence to bell curve graphs. Long live the pretentious stones seems to be their anthem - unfortunately.
Excellent-o! Fabulous-o! Must read!: The Art of Keeping Cool-AWESOME! My class read this books together...and we all loved it! This story is about Robert and his cousin Elliot. Meet Robert's family: Grandpa, Grandma, Abel Hoffman, Aunt Nan, Uncle Jake, and Carolyn. Oh and Robert's dad, Kenny, that is serving in World War 2. YOU SHOULD SO READ THIS BOOK! This book is full with ups and downs. Here are two words: buy it!
Art of KEeping Cool: This story is told by a 13-year old Americam boy named Robert. He tells his story during WW2 while his father is enlisted as a pilot. It is a fascinating read, learning about his friendship with a German artist as well as his relationship with his cousin and other family. It is a different take on a WW2 story and I would definitely recommend it.
the art of keeping cool: a wonderful wwii book for kids. It deals with the subjects of lost loved ones, espionage, prejudices and courage to stand up for what is right. We read this book as part of wwii history unit.
A War at Home: I read the book called The Art of Keeping Cool by Janet Taylor Lisle. I liked the book because it's historical fiction.The book is about a boy named Robert who lives in Sachem`s Head, Rhode Island with his cousin Elliot. In the beginning Robert lives on a farm and has to move because his dad is in England fighting the war, Robert does not like this.If you would like to know more about this book pick up a copy today!
Crabby Patties Review: Did you have a dad that fought in the war of World War 2? If you did you should read the book The Art Of Keeping Cool by Janet Taylor Lisle. If you didn't well Robert did. When Roberts's dad went to go fight the war he left the family by them selves. So they went to go live with their Grandma and Grandpa and Elliot. Robert did not like Elliot at all because in school he chewed on skin and he would also be selfish. Other than that he would make really good drawings and not tell anybody that he had amazing drawing skills because he could have became an artist.The book took place in Rhode Island. I don't know what other books Janet Taylor Lisle wrote because this is my first book by this author. This book is an OK book because they didn't stay on topic for example they and the main characters. Stayed on the war too much. That wasn't the main idea of the book.And I think that Janet Taylor Lisle can write good books!
The Art of Keeping Cool: The Art of Keeping CoolThe Art of Keeping Cool by Janet Taylor Lisle is about a boy named Robert. Robert lives in the time period of World War II. With Robert's dad in the Air Force, his mom can't support their farm in Ohio. They are forced to move to Sachem's Head, Rhode Island to live with his father's family. Here is where Robert meets his shy cousin Elliot.Robert quickly finds out that Grandpa Saunders is a really mean old man with a difficult, stubborn, personality. The book gets interesting when Elliot befriends a German artist who gives him art lessons. Robert is very suspicious and doesn't like Elliot going to see the artist behind his back.The book has a shocking ending and is a great, well written book. It also keeps readers on the edge of their seat.Kieron P. age 11
It was a public library book!: I was not inpressed with this purchase. I was trying to find a book on line to replace the lost public library book.When we got the book it was from a Cleveland public library. Which was hard to take this book to our public library in replacement of the lost one. Not happy with purchase. The seller should have said it had public library book that was very used and stamped all over.
Spiriti: This album contains some of the most hauntingly beautiful music I have ever heard, whimsical, delightful, coy, rousing, romantic, longing and deeply spiritual; the kind of music that makes you hold your breath to listen better - if you can breathe at all. The orchestration is richer than on their previous work, and the unholy combination of The Babes and producer John Cale is at an end, thank God.If we lived in more civilized times, temples would be build for the muses that inspire these marvellous musicians.
Ravishing!!: This group is simply phenomenal, and this is the best of their amazing output. It is gorgeous, ravishing, creative, original, inventive, and a whole lot more. But it is too short. It could be twice the length and still be too short!!The music is hard to pigeonhole, but I would call it "contemporary", but strongly inspired by the spirit, rhythm, and melodies of medieval music (but one could easily switch the terms "contemporary" and medieval in the above sentence and still be equally accurate). All the songs are evocative and transporting, but Dringo Bell is the apogee of the disc.This disc is also a celebration of the glory of the feminine. Truly so in an aural sense. But a quick visit to the website of the group shows this to be as true visually. For that reason also, the Baebes are unparalled.
THE BEST: These women are amazing. There music is so haunting and magical. How can you not love them. I've listened to all of their cds and plan on buying them as soon as possible. I just love it. It makes me feel like I'm in a mediaval story. It is so great. And it isn't just for renaisance freaks like myself. I also like rock and punk. This is awesome!
Misleading description....: The description makes it appear that you will receive 54 different colored pencils. What you actually receieve is 9 sets of 6 colored pencils all the same. It is definitely a misleading description and had I known, I would not have purchased it!
Misleading: The item descripiton is very misleading. They want you to think you get 54 different colored pencils but what you really get is just one set of colors in 9 groups. Had I know this I would of never ordered. Way over priced for what you get. The packaging is very cheap and won't be any good to store the pencils in. Save your money go to Wal-Mart and buy there you get more colors at a much lower price!!!!
Misleading: I agree with other reviewers - this product is misleading. It should make it clear that there are duplicates of colors and not 54 DIFFERENT colors! This would only be good in a classroom, school or as a gift for multiple kids. No one kid wants many of the same color.
Crayola 54 count colored pencil set: This will be a stocking stuffer for my grandchildren for Christmas as they love to color and are learning to share so I bought just 1 for them to share.
Too bad they broke up :(: I can't wait to hear Bright Light Fever. It's 2 of the 4 that were in this band.
Up there in Sonic Heaven: I'd been wondering what became of Echobelly, the band having been off the radar here in the states for some time, and came across this sublime offering of mostly ultra-melodic, ethereal dream-pop.The high points, such as the title track, "Djinn," the heart-wrenching ballad "Strangely Drawn," and, perhaps best of all, "You Started A Fire..." (with its memorable keyboard hook), are very high indeed, and there are no real throwaways among the lot.Sonya Madan's vocals sound as beautiful as ever -- actually better than before for the absence of the former "working class" vocal affectations -- and the production has a dreamy, somewhat Sergio Leone ambience, with twangy guitars complementing the backgound wash beautifully.I've recently re-visited the album (1/2011), and like it even more than before, bumping it to 5 stars, as clearly better than 80% of what's out there. Absolutely lovely.
The girl is hot, and so is the band: This is the type of recording that makes you want to go hear the act live and in person... they are such good musicians, and she is so, um, evocative in her song renderings, and on top of all that, they all seem to be having a GREAT time doing it. It's "swing" music but don't be misled, in case you think that genre limits this record. It's swing, its got some soul, its got some blues, and it's all wrapped up in one package. Somebody mail this disc to Letterman or Leno, it'd be nice to see an act with talent, who enjoys their music, have some success. Recommended!!
I think this is my favorite by Lavay!: I love all of her music but I think this is my favorite (maybe I'm just a bit of a bad girl!)
Not All That!: Don't get me wrong this album is decent -- but certainly nothing to rave about. Lavay Smith is constantly revered as the purist swing group in existence, but she and her band are in essence nothing more than a hepped up blues band.Her attempts at covering jump blues material flail wildly, and her voice falls flat.Stick with the bands previous debut, where the instruments better conceal her sophomoric vocals.
Thank You, Amazon.com!: I bought this CD on a whim, on an Amazon recommendation. Well, thank you Amazon for introducing me to Lavay and Her Red Hot Skillet Lickers! This is one of the best CDs I've heard in years -- superb musicianship that SWINGS, a mixture of blues, swing, and r&b that is as thrilling as it's eclectic, and, in Lavay, one of the sexiest voices since Billie Holliday. The original songs hold their own with the reworkings of numbers pioneered by Dinah Shore, Count Basie, Jay McShann and Dizzy Gillespie. I often think that Amazon reviewers are profligate with the "5 Stars," but this deserves every one. Bravo!
I wonder why she does not sing with Obbligato.: Lavay Smith & Her Red Hot Skillet Lickers do not understand the proper swing beat and rhythm and syncopation, so that Lavay sings out of tune and rhythm, the music not on the beat, and she does not sing or cannot sing with the instrumental Obbligatos.
The diva is for real: I love it! One fine dandy piece of candy that lavay is and she can sing too. What i like to do is sit back in my easy chair and drink cognac, last night i did it to lavay and her skillet lickers, sure it makes me want to dance but I have a bad hip and it wouldnt be to safe after all that cognac. Close your eyes and you want to snuggle up to gee baby aint i good to you, I want to take honey pie accross the dance floor and have her blow me a fat note, often i had to interrupt my fantasies and be amazed at just how good these guys can play. I'm a gamblin man, I like Atlantic city, if lavay was a poker hand I'd bet all my chips on her, she's a winner and this CD is a keeper.
on second thought not my first choice or my second: Bought this book specifically because I needed a recipe for the "Remus gin fizz" and was disappointed.While it does cover the basics i.e. the equipment list it has one, but it does not offer any guidance or recommendations on the equipment. for example that the strainer in unnecessary if you know how to use the Boston shaker.
Who uses sugar cubes?: With 25 years of experience, I am disappointed in this book. Sugar cubes? Who pours that much dry vermouth in a martini? Robyn is definetly not a bartender. I am tired of people outside the business cashing in on it. Whoever Robyn's sources were, probably felt the same way.
Wheres my shotgun?: I didn't buy this album but I know how terrible it is because I've heard almost every single track on the radio. I hate pop (though not as much as I hate rap) and if you actually consider the words okay, good, awesome or anything related to those words to describe this album then you are smoking something like crack, pot or crystal meth. This is terrible, just the words pop and especially trl make me stay as far away from this piece of crap as possible. Whoever came up with the idea of making a 'Best of Trl pop' anyway? All it is is useless overplayed songs with little meaning and no inspiration (good inspiration). Its albums like this though that make me glad that N'SYNC, Backstreet Boys and O-Town are here no more.*Note: Amazon needs to get 0 and 0 star options.*
Excellent pop album!: I've had this CD for 2 years and still play it sometime. But while some of the comments have been 0, you have to understand how much these pop songs were major hits within a 3 to 4-year period. Their videos were shown a lot on MTV's TRL, but the songs were catchy and addictive. This album keeps a consistent flow within its 56 minutes. And one of the rare ones to have boy bands NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees and O-Town on the same album. Would have liked Britney's Baby One More Time on here, but they might have had to go through record label permission and licensing issues to get it on there. I still love 3LW's No More, Mya's song, Sisqo's song, Willa Ford's song, Souldecision's funky Faded, BBMAK's song and others on here as well as Enrique Iglesias' tasty Be With You. A very fun and entertaining album that will have you dancing!!!!!
Like,ohmigod!: This is,like,totally awesome!!Ohmigod!!!These are,like,totally kewl songs!!These artists on here make very deep and thoughtful songs that they all wrote themselfs!!!LIKE TOTALLY!!!!Pop till you drop!
A very useful CD.: Really! This CD makes a great coaster. Every time I set my drink on it, my wood furniture stays dry and ring-free. This CD can also be used as a frisbee. Go ahead, take your pooch outside and use this CD to play frisbee with it! I guarantee you and your canine friend will have fun for hours and hours. But whatever you do, do NOT put this in your CD player and hit the play button. (Unless you're looking for an easy way to get a headache.)Yes, this is typical, wretched, pre-fabricated, sickeningly sweet pre-teen pap. But what do you expect with a title like "MTV: The Best Of TRL Pop"? Alice In Chains? Led Zeppelin? The stuff on here isn't even Blink 182. I probably shouldn't have to tell you this, but leave this one to collect dust on the record store shelf.That was too easy.
A time capsule of bad memories and fads: I don't even need to tell you how much this cd sucks. Just look at this crap on here, Nsync? The Thong Song? BBMak?This music is so lifeless and bland, but I didn't expect to find anything good on here such as The Smiths or Mindless Self Indulgence.AVOID AT ALL COSTS. JUST STAY AWAY!!!
REVIEW OF THE COVER: This album is pure recycled sticky bubblegum pap that millions of stupid white teenagers loved in the late 1990s. But what I REALLY hate is the cover! WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? WHO THE #%!$ IS THAT CHICK ON THE COVER?!?!? COULD THE WOMAN ON THE COVER BE UGLIER?!?!? IMAGINE THIS: THEY WENT THROUGH MANY POSSIBLE MODELS TO MAKE IT ON THE COVER AS THE LUCKY DEVIL WHO GETS TO SHOW THE ENTIRE WORLD 41.3% OF HER FACE! IMAGINE THE MODELS WHO WERE REJECTED.. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHACK. im done.
Is this supposed to be some kind of joke!: Could somebody tell me whose idea it was to put this useless collection together. This CD is nothing but disposable teenybopper pop-fluff that most of us have now grown out of long ago. The track selection is just laughable especially with insultingly immature krap like "I Wanna Be Bad" or "Thong Song", both of which are absolutely awful and completely faceless with as much emotion as an empty bowl. It's no wonder noone ever bought this useless CD when it came out as almost every song on here is on other compilations. This CD almost doesn't even deserve to exist. The most laughable cash-in joke I've ever heard of. >:(Buy some Fourplay, Peter Gabriel, Genesis, U2, or Underworld instead.
Sleek bag, fits a Dell too!: I bought this to keep my laptop safe when I put it directly in my back pack when I'm doing some light travel or going on a plane. Outer pocket holds mouse and power cord, but does add bulk. No biggie since I usually just put it in my pack. I have a Dell Studio XPS 17 and it fits good. Top sometimes slides off, but usually stays on pretty well. People like that it stays on, looks cool. Has 2 handles and the velcro closure on top. Dual zippers. Overall quality and function is excellent.
Juvenile: While it continues to amaze me that Ms. Burton managed to publish a book at an age when I was still interested in Hot Wheels, her novel is just that--the work of an 11 year old girl. The characters are poorly drawn, the plot is scattered and rarely cohesive, and the themes struggle to convey some deep hidden meaning. I also find it slightly presumptuous for a girl not yet in Junior High to be giving philosophical life lessons. I hope, however, that Ms. Burton remains a dedicated writer, as she clearly has talent; she simply needs the maturity and life experience to back it up.
Tara, honey: I was disappointed after completing this "novel". I thought it would be good, but it was uneventful and downright immature and strange. My son Timmy read it and started to cry.
LOVED IT: I loved everything about this book, from its rich descriptions of the Italian settings, its intriguing characters and their complex relationships, its original religious ideology and philosophical viewpoint, as well as the offbeat allegorical subplot of the chameleon.(This is a copy of what I said in my review on another online site, where I bought my first copy, as I felt compelled to put in a word after seeing the last two reviews...having noticed them when I was buying a second copy for a friend, and afraid people would miss a great read)
wow...: This was a thrilling book. I read it quickly, waiting to look for the deep motivating things. As an editor, I found many mistakes, and did not seem to find what she was trying to get at. Miss Burton, you tried very well indeed. Like I said, WOW... It was a very good try, and my advice to you from experience is: if one tries to be deep, one stays in shallow waters until they see what it takes to swim deeper.Very good attempt, but I hope your next novels create a better atmospherical sense. I didn't catch your message. GREAT TRY, AND KEEP YOUR BOOKS COMING. WE HOPE TO HEAR MORE FROM YOU!
Unbelievable, indeed: I found the book to be just that of an eleven-year-old; while not intensely awful, it seemed to be something not particularly good cleaned up by an editor. My vote: if you want a good read, go buy the next Harry Potter.
Chuck Full Of Laughs: Again, I love Baby Blues and this happens to be my favorite book in my baby blues collection, some of my favorite strips in this book are zoe's 6th birthday, zoe starting 1st grade, and wanda giving birth to her 3rd and last child in the seris, the very cute wren.
Wall-to-wall Baby Blues: We like the series and gave to our adult children because they have kids the age of Baby Blues kids.
Baby Blues is one of the best comic strips ever!: This was a great book. I love Baby Blues and this collection was no exception! I have read through it many times for a good laugh. My 10 year odl and 8 year old fight over who gets to read it next! An absolute must have for any Baby Blues fan.
MISERY THRILLS, CHILLS, DELIGHTS, AND AMAZES: It is my firm belief that Stephen King has produced thus far in his career four literary masterpieces (and another half-dozen or so which come pretty close): THE SHINING, THE STAND, MISERY, and, most recently, HEARTS IN ATLANTIS. (Of those that come close, I'd include 'SALEM'S LOT, THE DEAD ZONE, DIFFERENT SEASONS, PET SEMATARY, DOLORES CLAIBORNE, and THE GREEN MILE.) MISERY is without a doubt (in my opinion) King's greatest horror novel, an excellent exemplar of what constitutes a good horror/suspense tale, a memorable work indeed. I strongly recommend that anyone who enjoys being fraught with terror read this book.
Wow. A thriller until the end: I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was one of King's better books. He developed the characters very well.melody
Epic: A very long book but worth the wait for something that scared me near the end I am glad they made a movie but you can never beat the book. I love to read Stephen king and I'm 12 but this is one of the best ones so far of to read "cujo". (Read this book!!!!!)
Misery: Misery is a great story. I've read the book several times and I've also seen the movie by Rob Reiner numerous times. King vividly portrays all of the characters. It is very suspenseful and the action plays out nicely. You really feel the emotion and the terror. It is a top 5 Stephen King book in my estimation. Highly recommend it.
Misery: Greatest Stephen King book I have read other than Pet Sematary. It was great the way Annie Wilkins kept Paul a secret by killing the cops and maiming him.
One of his best.: This book is so demented it will likely scare you. Mr. King does a great job giving you details so you can perfectly picture the scenes and characters in your mind.
CREEPY BUT NOT GORY!: I remember reading this book 8 years ago in a staff house rumored to be haunted. Of course, that only contributed more to a wilder imagination! Like all other SK novels, Misery carries an element of supernatural. I couldn't consider the story as horror since there were no ghosts,apparitions nor exorcism --- but still paranormal in the sense that Annie Wilkes was acting abnormally. She was sort of a lunatic too obsessed with "Misery" & its writer. I also admire SK for being able to capture the readers' attention considering that the story was too tight-spaced ---- limited to 2 characters trapped in one house, with nothing to do but talk, write & axe each other :-)
Pretty good: I read "Misery" in about a week. It wasn't a great book but a really good one. There was alot of suspense and I really started to hate Annie Wilkes. Read this book, it won't dissapoint you.
King at his finest!: Misery is a great book. King puts the reader in Paul Sheldon's head and you can actually feel the pain he is going through. Unlike other unrealistic monsters,Annie Wilkes is totally believeable. The movie is alright too,but it leaves out the most suspenseful parts in the book (The amputations,the state trooper that is killed by Annie,and the other troopers that come to investigate).Plus,the movie kills Buster,the likeable sheriff. Not terrifying,but perfectly suspenseful! Well done!
One of my favorites: Annie Wilkes is a terrifying character--what made this book so scary is that all of this could actually happen!
ONE OF STEPHEN KING'S BEST NOVELS: Misery without a doubt has to be one of the best suspensenovels ever written. Stephen King manages to thrill usagain with this edge-of-your-seat thriller. He manages tocombine the elements of suspense and horror to create anamazing novel that takes you through the events of a writer'sworst nightmare becoming a reality: Trapped with his numberone fan. A must read for any Stephen King fan.
Good, but Distracting Errors: A very good book, one of the best ever, but the grammatical errors are just plain distracting. It took away from the suspense of the plot since i was always trying to figure out what was going on with the punctuation.
"A Thrill Ride": Probably the greatest piece of work Stephen King ever did, "Misery" tells the story of how a famous writer, named Paul Sheldon, drives his car off a road in the middle of a snowstorm in Colorado. He is rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes who brings Paul into her home where she nurses him back to health. She confides in Paul that she is his #1 fan as she loves his "Misery" novels, a series of books that Paul is most famous for. However, once Annie realizes that Paul has killed off Misery in his latest book, Annie displays signs that she is totally unhinged and Paul is swept into absolute horror. It is then up to Paul's writing skills to escape the hell that Annie has put him in. "Misery" would be turned into an excellent motion picture in 1990 directed by Rob Reiner, and it would garner Kathy Bates the Oscar for Best Actress for her mesmerizing performance of Annie Wilkes. The book, like the film, is a must-own.
King at his best: This is how Stephen King should've written all of his books: straight to the point, no nonsense thriller. Too bad most of his other work lacks these qualitys nowdays, but Misery is a must for anyone into the horror genre.
Great: I loved the movie so much that I decided to get this book as a christmas gift for a friend who loves reading. Lets just say its my way of bringing Mysery back to life and giving it to the world. :-)
5 stars: This was bone chilling. This book was hard for me to put down, and the movie never came close to be as exciting as the book is.
One of King's best: Although Misery has only two main characters and one setting, this book manages to astound you with surprise at every turn. This is a book where King uses suspense very well, and I found this novel almost impossible to put down. I was horrified by Annie, and at one time almost puked at the thought of her (so go out and buy this book right now!) King made us almost feel sorry for her, and as you see into her past, you can start to see her slow decay into madness. Paul's inner strugles to write a good novel instead of the Misery trash is also intriuging, and that part almost seems to come from his own life. Overall, this book is up there with Salems Lot and the Shining, and is a "must have" in any horror collection.
The movie is better than the book.: I was interested in reading this book after I saw the movie. The book is in my opinion, very disagreeable. I had a hard time understanding how the hero of the book gave that evil woman chances. One moment he's saying how you can't reason with crazy and the next moment he's sorry for her and not wanting to hurt her feelings. He had an opportunity to get away or die trying, and did not take it. I couldn't buy his reason for not leaving and then she came back and hurt him super bad. There are none of those brain teasing games in the movie; the woman is nuts and he tries everything to get away from her. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody.
Not His Best Work: If you are a really big Stephen King fan, you might be a little dissapointed with this book. I think it was alright, but it was really slow and dragged you through most of the book. By reading the back, it really sounds like a good read, but the only parts of this book that I really enjoyed were the exciting parts where Paul Sheldon was in danger, and the ending. I found this book boring and slow and I would not really recommend it. There are plenty more Stephen King books that are much more exciting than this particular book. I think it is a good piece of writing, but I don't think it is really that good of a book. I would suggest that you pick up a different Stephen King book before you read this one because most of his other books are a lot better than this one.
Misery: I didn't like the book Misery written by Stephen King because it draged on until the very end. There were some parts in it that were very discusting. The story draged on and it made it confusing cecause you didnt't know if he was dreaming or it was really happening. The oher thing I didn't like about this book is it curses to much, and it had hardley any kind of action till the end. I wouldn't recommend thios bokk to anyone.
The word monotone could have been coined to describe this: very interesting to read the other reviews. This book was completely wrecked for me by its unrelieved er ... misery. In all Kings best work (and I'm a big fan), happiness and unhappiness compliment each other nicely, balancing the tone of the novel.The other very simple fault King is prone to, an american disease almost, is too many 'happy' endings. In his best works, like pet sematary there is always doubt and ambiguity. Why are americans so addicted to happy endings in horror novels?
A book that's easy to put down and walk away from.: Misery is perhaps the worst book I have ever read. From cover to cover, nothing but predictability. Paul sheldons attempt to decieve Annie, and her naivety to fall for it every time got very old. By the time I was halfway through I wanted one of them to die. It didn't matter which one it was. If you are new to the Stephen King scene, pick a different book. I would hate for you to get the wrong idea about this writer by reading this book.
Great Ending-Nothing Else: The ending to Misery is absolutly hoffiying. It made me cringe. It, however, is the only good part about the book. The story doesn't even start rolling until Annie takes the ax to Paul. I am a very big Stephen King fan, but Misery could have really been something. He has a lot of great books, but this isn't one of them.
An awesome S. King novel.: This was the first King book I read. I grabbed it at the library one day mainly out of curiosity. It was so good, I couldn't put it down. I didn't do anything but read for two days. This book made me a Stephen King fan.It's thrilling and quite frightening. When I was reading alone at night, I was sincerely scared, it was awesome. One of my favorite books. Read it.
A Trip into Hell: Annie Wilks is a she devil with no mercy towards writter Paul. Why? Love+hate at it's best will she kill Paul before he finishs writing the book dedicated to her. The Movie lacks in suspense that is why you need to read the book, like I did. Steven King in my opinion writes books that keep me gluded to the pages and my favorite book he has written is the Green Mile.
Read it or weep: One of the best Stephen King's novels! It grabs you from the first to the last page. I read it in 2 days. A must! For you that saw the movie... FORGET IT! The book is 1000x better! What can I say? It's Stephen King...
Check this out: If you like to read suspend stories, I think you should try "Misery" by Stephen King. It is almost 400 pages, and the first time I saw this book, I didn't really interested in it because it is long. But after I read a couple of chapters, I started to like it, specially in the middle of the book when the main character tried to escape from the house before the phycho woman came back. If she caught him trying to escape, she would punished him. Her punishment is unlike parents punishing their kids. She would make him feel pain. She could even cut off his leg. This woman has her own reason for doing this, but I don't understand her reason, but who can understand a psychotic's motives? I don't think so unless you are phycho, too. Anyway, I recommend this book for those of you who are looking for new books to read. It is good. Try it!!!!
Put A Little Misery In Your Pipe And Smoke It!: Undeniably in my opinion, another one of King's great triumphs in a long list. This book put me out of my, "Misery," in the search for something to read. It would be horrible to be placed in the same exact situation as Paul Sheldon. The movie is quite excellent and follows the book wonderfully.
Not As Good As I Thought It Would Be: Misery opens up really slow. It doesn't even start getting interesting until Annie starts taking the ax to him. However, the end was really scary. And then he fools you right at the end. I thought it was the best ending to a Stephen King book. I am a Stephen King fan, a big one. But I was really disapointed in Misery.
Misery was a killer book: The book was very exciting .It had alot of creativity.I have read all of Stephen King's books and i would have to say that this one was the best.It was a joy reading a book like this.Keep up the good work.Waiting to read more breathtaking horror books by Stephen King.Everyone needs to read Misery and his other books.
Stunning and very Lively: I believed this book was an over all very good book. Although at times it could be gruesome, but I stuck with it and read the whole thing. It was interesting and I recomend it for people who like suspense.
this book was so intense.. more depth than the movie: I have seen Misery on television many times and i love it more and more everytime but the book you have got to read. It goes into so much more detail. The torture Paul Sheldon goes through is much more than the movie even touches. Annie Wilkes and her wiked thoughts are even greater. I love the book misery and i love the writer Stephen King. thank you Alair
A Classic, and certainly one of King's best!: It is a very good book. King is leaving his regular style of dealing with para-normal phenomenon, and start dealing with the most normal, and yet most para-normal thing: the Human soul. More than it is a horror book, it is a thriller, and a very good one. You feel the sweat dripping down your neck and your breathe getting faster when the hero is in tension and fear (and there are many moments like this.). This is a story about a situation that we wouldn't like to find ourselves in, and that's why I personally symphatyzed the hero, it is the story of the human soul in its struggle to survive and in the depthes of madness.
Excelente: Esta novela es super buena, se la recomiendo a cualquiera. Sientes angustia, odio, repulsion, ganas de estrangular a Annie, y estas en una constante tension. Desde el principio al final la novela da escalofrios.
Now here's a book...: that was better than the movie in every way. I first read this book in 1989 and it was an absolute page-turner from the very beginning. As the story unfolded we found out about a writer in serious pain after crashing his car somewhere in Colorado, a nurse who took him in who seemed quite competent except for one thing-it soon became very obvious that she was absolutely crazy. So good was King's description of his wounded writer-held-prisoner that I as a reader almost began to feel what he was feeling. I had to keep putting the book down and reminding myself that this was "just a story."This one is terror and suspense all the way and the many detours the story takes en-route to its dramatic conclusion only add to the already richly engossing tale it is. Buy this one and be ready for one heck of a ride! A word of warning: you will never view chainsaws, lawnmowers, and birthday cakes in the same way.
A masterpeice.: This book contains every element you could possibly desire. The writing is perfect, and it keeps your heart racing until the end. Annie Wilkes is that character you love to hate, and Paul is the big hero you will be rooting for. Please buy this mystery suspense filled book of horror, you will enjoy it.
Great Read.: This is my first King novel (a little late, and I know) and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The translation for the kindle was pretty bad though, that is why 4 stars.
Good Book: I really like this book. I've seen the movie and i really like it. i haven't gotten that far in this book but i think I will like it alot when I'm done.
Good book.: This book was good but I don't know why it got higher ratings than his lesser known books like Desperation and Rose Madder.It's about a writer who gets writernapped by a crazy woman.He's her #1 author and she uses him as a "pet writer."This book is worth reading (like all his books) but if you want really cool books of his that aren't as popular, get Desperation and Rose Madder, they were more fun in my opinion.
This Bitch Is Crazy !: Annie Wilkes is off the chain. You all know that this book is about Paul Sheldon who gets into a car accident because he was all buzzed up with don pariogone. Then this psychotic biach (Annie) takes Paul and "nurses" him if thats what you wanna call it.Then she dause stuff to him that you need to find out by reading this amazingly written book. If you've seen the movie then you stillhave to read this book it's that good!
Stephen King at his absolute greatest: I started off with The Shining, it was good, although I thought the whole supernatural thing could be dropped, then I read Carrie, which was OK , then I read Needful Things, which was a great dissapointment.And now finally, just as i was turned off by Stephen king after Needful Things, came Misery, The best book have ever read!!!! Thankyou Mr. King, for an excellent suspense novel. I t was so realistic unlike Needful things!!!!!!
Why can't Stephen K. write more believeable books like this: Although I really like the supernatural, I really think Steve K. should work on more believable novels like this one === even though it was written in 1987, his genius is still evolving.
Pretty good, you critics!: This is one of King's better books. The reader really begins to feel for Paul after he is put through a living hell. A great book. I'm ashamed to say that I did not like Misery's Return, the book within a book..
Too many typos in Kindle version: Good story, but it was frustrating to read through all those typos in Kindle edition. There must've been more than a hundred of them.
**KINDLE review**: Great story - TERRIBLE TRANSLATION TO THE KINDLE.Way too many spelling errors!!! Missplaced periods all over!!! I paid $3.99...I guess you get what you pay for.
A Cockadoodie Great Book!: Stephen King's "Misery" is a psychological horror that had me grimacing and saying OMG one minute, then laughing out loud like a cockadoodie lunatic the next. Annie's oogie vernacular tends to stick in my mind long after the read (can you tell, you dirty bird?).Romance writer Paul Sheldon never should have gone driving drunk near Sidewinder, Colorado. He crashed his car in a snowstorm, only to have Annie Wilkes, ex-nurse turned serial killer, pull him out. When she recognized him from the back of her Misery novels, she, being his number-one fan, takes him hostage, forcing him to write a new book for her.If you're reluctant to read this because you've already seen the movie, read it anyway! I loved the film version with Kathy Bates, but the book is even better. Things happen a bit differently, and you get an inside look at everything that goes on in poor Paul's mind during months of horrific torture.I LOVED this book (so vivid!) and highly recommend it.
Misery didn't really interest me: I read books a lot and when I read this book It was really boring. Usually books that I read pull me in. I call this book an "unfinished book". I read this book because it was for a report for school(New Utrecht High School-Mr. Nelson)
Sheer MISERY to read!: Read this book if you are stuck on a submarine and you have read everything else already. I saw the movie, thinking that it might be better (but, of course, movies are never better than books). Boy, was I wrong! The book was bad, and the movie was worse. King does not develop characters well in general, and he does a particularly poor job in "Misery". In any good book, I will find myself anticipating a knowledge of the characters' fate. Not so in "Misery". Within 100 pages, I had no feelings for either of the main characters. I considered it *work* to finish this book. Believe me, if you can get through this, you can get through anything.
Dull, uneventful, worthless: The main problem with this book is that you just don't care about the fates of the characters. Sure, you've got all the wham-bam gruesome action, some well-described scenes of torture, but even during these sequences where your interest should be at it's high-point, the mind tends to drift, to imagine alternate scenerios, to develop a better telling of the story itself. Every dead-end page after every drudging leaf of cheap, sanitized paper it goes on and on and on and who the hell cares in the end? Stephen King has never been a great writer, just a man with a fertile imagination and enough ability to get by with a fully created world. But, when the story lacks depth or incident--like Misery--then all that scamming and lying to conning for prestige is gone and you're left with a hack churning out yet another volume of garbage.
True Misery: True misery is reading this novel. By the time he'd written this, King had succumbed to the "my every word is golden" delusion, so the thing is much larger than it needed to be. After reading this because I promised a friend I'd do it (oh, what we do for pretty women)I decided that even 180 pages would've been too long. The conclusion is unsatisfactory because some of the cast of characters survive.
worst King book: This book is terrible. I don't know about everyone else, but a story about a guy recovering in a pyscho's house isn't my idea of a griping story. I suggest anything else.
T H I S B O O K S U C K S ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !: This is the worst book I have ever read. It should not be in bookstores anywhere!!!!!! It was soooo dull it took me a year to get through it
Gem is a royal pain in the [rear]: The first few pages of this book started out good but quickly went down hill. I found this story unbelievable. Gem quickly got on my nerves. She is an obsessive, annoying brat. How can she still be in love with Chase after he had been gone for 5 years! Considering he was probably around less then a year before he left. Apparently this girl led a sheltered life. Gem is desperate and irritating and fell in love with someone she hardly knew. And then she forced him to marry her. The only reason why I gave this book 2 stars was because it kept me interested enough to finish it and find out how Chase eventually told her he loved her.
Ain't nothing like the real thing...: I've watched these guys progress from three strangers to three of the hardest working, tightest jamming people I know. The songs are instant classics that stick to your soul. I just caught them at Nightingales in Manhattan at the PCP show. All the bands were great. Anyway, buying this C.D. is money extremely well spent and even though I'm family and helped with this album I tell no lies!
Harrad Experiment (1973): I would have rated this video higher except for the fact that about 6 minutes of the original film has been cut. I saw the original release and there are nude scenes and audio censorship from the original. I noticed on IMDB that the original was 97 minutes, but there was a 91 minute UK release so this must be the UK release. I wish that the US release was available.
Never a good movie...: ...but more of an acceptable way to get nudity on screen in a "responsible" manner. Amazon's streaming video of it makes it worse. It is grainy and washed out. It was shot on a low budget and lacked much aesthetic value forty years ago, but now it is unwatchable.
The only way to go: Pigtail connectors like this are the only way to go. This one fit perfectly into the Subaru connector and each wire, besides matching the usual color code for motor vehicles, has each wire labelled.
This Went #1 in the Americana chart the week after Johnny Cash&9inch nails: Unfortunately it raced up the charts so fast we didnt have CD's available for 3weeks.This collection is a celebration of two cultures. Classic Country from one of it's founders( Hank Cochran has had 8 thousand songs recorded and discovered Willie Nelson).Billy Don Burns is like a modern day, motorcycle gang version of James Dean with a guitar slung over his shoulder, and a lifetime of adventures in the form of songs.For people who live way out on the edge, or for those who just want to hear about it from the experts, THIS ONE IS FOR YOU!! It's hard to find great music these days, but these guys did, and it's on this CD. Greg Kane
not a good movie.: This is a poor attempt at a teen sex comedy (e.g. American Pie). The stilted and predictable dialogue, poor direction and generally low quality means I didn't see much to make one laugh. On top of the general low level of the movie it is basically a string of uncreative jokes based on mean spirited jabs at stereotypes of the working class, women, and others. It lacks what I would consider the heart of good films in this genre- empathy for the characters.
kjixvjdi[sj idf;ivj: jfhgf hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhh h h h i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i this sucked
Movie review: This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. I do not recomend it to anyone. It was just plain silly.
a waste of time: Juvenile and shallow. A virtual waste of time. Only watched it because I'd already watched most of the free prime movies.
Bad Acting Bad Directing: Once in a while I don't mind watching a low budget poorly scripted, directed and acted movie but this one will leave you wishing that you could get the time back you spent watching it, at least with a DVR I was able to skip ahead over some of the scenes that were too unbearable to watch.
HORRIBLE: THIS WAS A HORRIBLE MOVIE, SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN MADE! I HAVE SEEN BETTER IN SILENT FILMS BACK IN THE DAY
upset: to be honest this movie was horrible the only nude scene is the begining for like two minutes when the girl takes a bubble bath, the movie wasnt even funny
soap opera style movie: Well, I was expecting a bit more entertainment. Instead, the action proceeds much like a soap opera and never reaches any suspenseful or frightening climaxes. Example, young girl being used as "bait" for vampire waits nervously unaware that the vampire is advancing upon her from behind. The camera pans down so you can see the advance of the vampire from under the couch the girl is resting on. What should be a terrifying, suspenseful scene is undermined by the view of blue slippers and the bottom of a dark blue cloak on the "creature" (an attractive but blah, middle aged mom) walking up on her. Ridiculous, and not even funny! On the positive side, it is a nicely shot movie, has good sets, good costumes, and there is one good fencing scene. So, two stars. Other than that, pretty uneventful. Not worth a second viewing.
Kronos: Hammer's Dying Attempt At Medival Vampire Films: TO: Hammer Film FansThe Good;It has a cool poster, and some good scenes.The Bad:Kronos is well, less than brillant. It is one of hammer's attept's to change vampire films. Among the others are Vampire Circus, a really weird Hammer vam[pire film from 1972, Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires, the kung-fu vampire movie, Satanic Rites of Dracula, the satanic cult vampire film, the Vampire Lovers, the super-violent hammer film, Countess Dracula, the historical vampire fim, and Dracula A.D. 1972, the groovy/mod, mod vampire film. Another reveiw said that it got an R, because it was in a double feature with Frankenstein And the Monster from Hell, but that film isn't actually that bad. Ii would give it four stars!From: The hammer Film Reveiwer
The vampires aren't the only thing that sucks.: Alright, normally I love a good B-movie but this dosen't even rate that high. Captain Kronos is a lame attempt at a vampire tale. It ignores most of the traditional rules which you will either love or hate and is pitifully acted. The first 1/3 of the movie is all set up and exposition with no pay off at the end. Most of the movie consists of Kronos flashing a colgate smile and giving lines to his new found girlfriend that even Austin Powers would find chessy.The rest of it are scenes of young girls who suddenly have a black robbed figure appear out of no where while on a frollick some where or another and have their youth drained away. The climax if you can call it that is as about as scary as robin hood men in tights without the humor.If you read these other reviews and are tempted remmeber this 99% who write them are die hard fans who will love it no matter what because it's a hammer film. The other one % just got screwed.
Woeful: I unfortunately bought a dud. A diehard vampire fan will watch just about anything in that genre and while I realised this was from a particular genre (not necessarily being vampire), I was very very disappointed with the whole thing. Not much point picking it to peices cause it is just my opinion but a stronger, more realistic (to the role) and appealing (not necessarily typically attractive) and just interesting leading man would have helped immensely. I was not thrilled, chilled, suspense filled or eventually even interested in continuing watching it cause it was just boring and a bit ridiculous. I didn't like it.
ONE OF HAMMER'S BETTER VAMPIRE FILMS: One of Hammer's better Vampire films, this one presents some interesting turns on the lore. These vampires can appear in the day time, and as they feed they become younger. One of the more chilling effects in the picture occurs when the head of the family of vampires walks through a forest in the daytime, blooming flowers instantly die as she passes.The film has a very good musical score, beautifully done sets and good cinematography (As do most of the Hammer Films). The cast is perfect, and includes the stunningly beautiful Caroline Munro. I've met her a few times at autograph shows, and found her to be an extraordinarily nice person who adores her fans every bit as much as they do her.The DVD is nicely packaged, with good sound and clear, sharp picture. This is a must for any Hammer Fan!
Captain Kronos- Vampire Hunter: This is the last Hammer film that goes back to the golden days of Hammer late 50's to early 60's. A fun film to watch and an excellent addition to my Hammer film collection. If you enjoyed the Hammer Dracula and Frankenstein films you will enjoy Captain Kronos. John R. Tracy
Just what I was looking for...: Just what I was looking for. I had searched every specialty kitchen supply store and every Asian food store in my area and none of them carried any item like this.I'd had to use a metal bowl before I found this which sushi recipes tell you strictly not to use. There was a noticeable improvement in my sushi rice while using this product.I also liked how the base of the bowl pops out for easy cleaning.My only complaint was that the base of the bowl did bow upon my first usage. I had to set a fairly heavy pot on it after cleaning in order to flatten it out.Other than that I had no complaints. The company that shipped it got it to me very quickly. It worked well and overall was well worth the purchase.
An interesting science book by a reporter: For the most part, the author seems to have pretty good information for the time of the book's printing, but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms, be warned; there are several places where the book goes awry, for example: the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus indicate that it was a solitary animal, occasionally hunting in pairs. Problem: no tracks of a t. rex have been discovered to date, a decade and a half after the writing. Aside from that and a few other points, though, the book is good reading.
Fantastic Book: I loved this book. It was a little slow to start but offers a fantastic overview of the major discoveries in the history of Paleontology. From the forst scientific thoughts on dinosaurs, to the notorious bone wars of Cope and MArsh, to the modern greats Ostrom, Bakker, Horner, etc. It's all covered here in a well written enjoyable fashion.
"Heart Attack" in its wake for Goldy Fish etc...: Most fish have bad eye sight. They probably don't know these other swimming ornaments are fake.Small fish will get intimidated very easily... I can imagine these huge sharks such as the Hammer & Great White giving Goldie-fish a heart-attack!(Shark Reef, Uncle Milton, or Discovery Kids) Did not consider the aquatic consequences of this toy.
5 dead fish later.... don't even bother: I bought this toy for my shark-crazed 5 year-old... she was so stoked and we prepped the tank, added the recommended water chemicals and dropped in two small goldfish. Less than 24 hours later, they were dead. Repeat... 40 hours later... same story. We tried a single Betta, Frank, but less than 4 days later... he's dead. We don't know what it is. The water was tested, it's fine. We think it is the overall design of the tank, could the tight-fitting lid be responsible? Possibly ammonia by-product buildup from the fish? Who knows. But we have given up and are dumping this promising toy into the trash bin.
Very cool, but not for the fish: The shark reef is very cool looking, has very good instructions and is beautifully constructed. However the three sharks that they give you to put in with the live fish, really crowd the other fish- they didn't look happy. So we took the sharks out and they were happier, but 2 days later the larger fish died. 2 smaller fish remain, but based on what I read about aquariums, smaller aquariums are difficult to maintain because the PH levels can get off easily due to excess food or excess waste produced by the fish. I worry that my son will get disappointed if we keep losing fish...
Dead fish: My 4 year son is learning about the fragility of life the hard way with this tank.Two Goldfish, two flushes. If I take the struggling fish out of the tank and put it in a fish bowl it seems to come around, but they won't last 24 hours in this tank. I've followed the directions to a T, Adjusted the pH, tried lights on lights off, pump on pump off, even used bottled water, but the fish just do a slow fade when in the tank.
Terrible toy: This tank kills fish. We have lost four fish in less than a week. At first we thought we had done something wrong, but after reading the instructions several times, testing the water, and talking to the pet store, we have determined that it is the tank. We knew something was up when our two fish died at almost the same time (just a couple hours apart). We replaced the fish and the same thing happened. We will not be sentencing any more fish to death in this dud of a tank.
Fish Killer Aquarium: We bought this for my son for Christmas, on the conditon that he never put fish in it, since the reviews said it killed fish. That worked fine until he won a fish at the school carnival. Of course it had to go in with the sharks. So with freshly treated water and a prayer, we put the fish in. The next day it was very listless and lying along the bottom. After checking the reviews, I saw one where the person removed the fish and they recovered. So we've taken the beta out and are waiting to see if it will survive. I still would rate this aquarium 1 star for cool looks and lights, but it's very noisy and I believe it kills fish.
Forget it: This is simply a fish torture device! It will kill fish quickly. No filtration, etc. So, if you want your child to learn about losing a loved one.....get this. If you want your child to have pet fish, go out and get a proper aquarium so they will live and prosper. Do not by this product!Smarter Grampa and Grandma
True reviews: We were so excited when we saw this fish tank. It is so cute. My son had a happy and healthy two week old carnival goldfish that we couldn't wait to put in it. We went right out to get him a friend as well. Within 24 hours the new fish died. We had the water tested bought water conditioner and bought another new fish. Within 24 hours again, it died. The original goldfish was still alive and kicking but seemed to be running out of steam. Heartbroken and perplexed as to why this was happening, I went online and did some research. I was AMAZED at the reviews I found and am stunned that everyone has had the same results! I immediately moved "goldie" to a new home. Thanks to all your reviews we still have our beloved carnival fish!
Do Not Buy: The biggest educational value this tank provides is the lesson of life and death. This tank kills all fish!!!! They should recall this horrible tank.
Excellent Book!!: My children,ages 14, 10, and 8 really enjoyed this book. The main character,Myles, gets into all kinds of mischief. He makes the book fun. We used this book at the end of a homeschool Middle Ages unit study. I wish we would have used it in the beginning. This book, in my opinion, is the best by Howard Pyle.
Great look at coming of age in the days of chivalry.: This timeless classic is a great look into the thoughts and dreams of a young boy growing into adulthood in the days of castles and knights. Well written and filled with suspense as Myles Falworth negotiates his way in a sometimes hostile feudal environment.
Literature Book: This book was purchased for my son to read for his history class for a particular time period. Nothing more, nothing less.
Grand old classic of boy becoming man in the Age of Chivalry: A wonderful story of life in the Middle Ages. A boy finds himself sent by his impoverished, blind father to a castle to serve as a squire. There he grows up, learns to become a knight, and begins to learn the reasons why his father had sent him there: to position him to challenge his father's enemy at the court of Henry IV and restore the family fortune and good name. A little romance even occurs for the lad. The style is a little quaint, as I believe this book was written at the end of the nineteenth century, but in the context of this tale of ancient times, it feels right anyway! A good tale for young men and women about the triumphs of right over wrong, and the importance of standing up for what you believe in. Great illustrations by the author.
Coming of Age, Coming of Honor.: This is a classic coming-of-age story set in the age of knights and fair ladies. Myles starts out as a lowly squire, but he gains in strength and skill, wisdom and honor, and ends up a knight. Also read Otto of the Silver Hand by the same author.
Men of Iron The making of a young man to a knight: This was a time whena young man who had to be carefully taken in the steps of knightlyhood. With the days going by, he had o fight his father's foe.I would recommend this book to a friend of mine who would like to read classsic books, and hopefully he/she would find this book enjoying. I wouldn't say the boook was totally boring, however, it could have been a bit more exciting. It always counts to the persons' opinon.
Don't miss it!: Ewa Podles' voice is incredibly rich, her technic is astonishing and she sings so expressively that really brings tears in my eyes. She is definitely a diva and performs these wonderful pieces the way they should be performed. The booklet includes libretto with English translation, which is very helpful for those who don't speak Russian. However, the music and the performance are so emotive that can touch you even if you do't know the words.
Songs of Ewa.: There is simply NO BETTER recording of "Songs and Dances of Death" by Mussorgsky. Ewa Podles voice in Lullaby makes your blood freeze in your veins; her interpretation of Death is terribly beautiful. It adds to the effect knowing that in Russian "death" is a feminine word, contrary to Latin languages, so a female voice singing for both the Mother and Death is stunning.One can compare this with also a very good recording by Sergei Leiferkus or a much worse one by Brigitte Fassbaender. Alas, Russian cannot be sung properly by those who are not linked to that language, and since Ewa Podles is Polish, her pronunciation is as good as Russian. And her voice caps it all; she is a stunning, amazing diva; the adulation she receives fro her unique range and beauty of her tone, mastery of her tuning is well-demonstrated by this opus.Truly this is the best "Songs and Dances"; HIGHLY recommended for Russian music lovers.
foundaional approach to homiletics: I was looking for a basic homiletics text and have found it in this book. Cantalamessa looks at the Word of God itself, rather than methodology. He proposes a foundation for preaching and evangelization based on an experience of Jesus as a person rather than as a theological construct or concept. He does not eschew discussions of difficult topics, e.g. verbal inflation and absolute truth. His familiarity with a broad sampling of the Fathers of the Church and other literature both grounds and clarifies the presentation. The Alan Neame translation is a pleasure to read.
Great!!: This product is great. I bought it for my significant other who's favorite animal is the duck-billed platypus, and I am very satisfied with my purchase.
Rust inside spout, 7 months old: Owned only for a few months. Found rust inside spout, who knows for how long. Amazon will only warranty item for 30 days, so I cannot return Amazon. So I sent a email to the company. Got a email from Reston Lloyd apologizing and telling me to return the item to Amazon, they will not take the return, oh and by the way do not to use because of the rust. They will not warranty their own product.
not so whistling tea kettle: After looking for months and months for a tea kettle with a harmonica whistle (train sound) that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, I found this one. I was so excited.Sometimes it whistles, sometimes it doesn't. Also, there is not a tight seal on the lid. I am disappointed but exhausted from the long search and would rather have a "sometimes train sounding" kettle than one that won't do it at all. .. so I kept it.Maybe when I am rich again, I'll go get the other one ...but who would spend $75 on a tea kettle? Something seems just wrong about that with people starving in Burma and all..
Superb book for anyone interested in Germany's version of the world's game.: Uli Heese-Lichtenberger's account of the history of German football is amazing. But anyone who has ever followed his regular columns before reading "Tor!" will not be surprised. I recommend this book to anyone who is the least bit interested in not only Germany's version of the world's game, but in a bit of German history too.My seller here at Amazon was awesome too. My book arrived faster than expected and was in wonderful condition.
Rock Opera - Not Symphonic Metal: There is some good singing here, and some ok music, but the metal aspect is minor and out of place. Imagine Celine Dion doing a Disney movie soundtrack with double bass drumming, but with little to no guitars. This band is nothing like Lacuna Coil or Evanescence, and nothing like Dimmu Borgir - who are real symphonic metal kings.
Great, but hard to find!: I spent 6 months looking for this CD after I first got "The Divine Conspiracy" and finally got my hands on, "The Phantom Agony". I turned my attention to finding this album and it was worth my wait! Every track on this album is great! I especially love "Mother of Light", "The Last Crusade" and the beautiful duet, "Trios Vierges". It is SUCH a great album and I recommend the other two Epica CDs as well! They just keep getting better and better!
More Variety: This is Epica's second album and they have improved on their first one. The first one was somewhat repetitive (but since it was repeating something pleasant to hear, that was okay). There are still a nice balance of soprano and growls that marks this CD as a Beauty and the Beast or Gothic metal. The music is the one with the major face lift. With a variety of time signatures and more intricate instrumentation, this effort keeps the replay factor much better than their first disc. The sound retains the distinctive sounds of Mark Jansen found on the first two After Forever discs and the first Epica CD. However, Mark seems to have grown musically since the songs have variety to them. I recommend this album if you like After Forever or other Gothic metal bands - it is worth it.
Powerful: Another fine effort by one of my new favorite bands, Epica. This one has less of the cookie monster growls than either Phantom Agony or Divine Conspiricy, therefore it all sounds a bit more accessible. However, there does seem to be a small price in that the music, while still great, doesn't seem quite as strong as Epica's other efforts. The difference is very small indeed. Perhaps those growls are the key...hmmmm...
A real page turner: A very interesting book, very well wrote. I enjoyed it very much! I want to read more of Hall's books. Keep up the good work!!!
An excellent book.: I loved this book. I've read it twice and know I'll read it more in the future. This book was full of suspense and surprises from beginning to end. I highly recommend it to young adults.
the second Once Blue album: Jesse Harris writes in the liner notes of this remastered & re-issued album that indeed the 9 bonus tracks on this CD were from the recording sessions from what was to be the 2nd Once Blue album. If you were looking for another album from them, look no further.... you've found it.
Tastes Good but bad Ingredient: I really like the taste and the cute bottle. I would put it all over alot more things if it didn't have xantham gum in it, which is a lab created product made from genetically engineered bacteria. Who knows what that stuff is doing to your system and reproductive capabilities down the line? I have used this stuff when I was dining out and was very impressed with the flavor. It tastes good on burritos. I just would not want to buy it to use every day because of the chemical ingredient. Maybe they should try organic cornstarch or arrowroot powder to thicken it instead.
Price Comparison: My wife purchased this item at "Shoppers" supermarket in Laurel, MD today. She was complaining that the price was raised from under $2.00 to $2.98 when the item was moved into the Gourmet section of the store. Still, the $2.98 she paid is a far cry from the $13.20 this company gets, when shipping is included.
Business rules bible: This is the book I was waiting for. Before this book I spent hundreds of hours researching business rules on the internet and still didn't get the detailed material that this book contains. I agree with other reviewers that you can use this book to base a business rules implementation on, and you can also use it to teach business rules to your team. I think it has a perfect balance of implementation, concept and practical information and recommend it to anyone who is interested in business rules. I skimmed through the Morgan book that others have recommended and like it too, but it is basic and will not help you in implementation. This (von Halle) book is the one to get and it's the most complete book on the subject available.
Very disappointing: I bought this book based on some of the enthusiastic reviews here but was very disappointed. I think people who see rules engines as the next big thing and are very excited about it may be enthusiatistic about this book because it pushes that line very hard. However, there is very little in this book that reflects hard practical experience or that is likely to surprise an experienced software designer with a basic understanding of rules engines. Good books on this subject are still waiting to be written.Instead of this book I would recommend reading "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software" by Eric Evans and the documentation for whatever rules systems you are considering.
They may have liked it, but I didn't at all: It has always amazed me at the amount of money I spend foolishly. I read reviews and I purchase expensive books (like this one) and can't wait until it is delivered to my door so I can gain a better perspective on a specific subject. If that's your goal too, then you're wasting your time and money just like me.Business rules are important (that's why I bought this book) but I didn't learn a thing that I already knew. Actually, I could probrably write a better one than this and I'm just a lowly DW architect.I'm not going to get into the facts, the other reviewers didn't either. Just take my advice and look elsewhere.
Smaller than I thought it would be.: Smaller than I thought it would be and took a long time to arrive. It was to be a birthday gift and it arrived long after the date that I expected it.
Good for 2 men's bikes: Purchased the HR8000 based on the positive reviews. Unit is solid, easy to connect to my hitch. However, loading any 3 bikes on it requires expert Tetris skills. I gave up after spending more than 2 hours at it. Even if I could have gotten the pedals and handlebars and such to play nice, the spacing of the forks is too wide for a girls' mountain bike. Spoke with Hollywood's customer service, they suggested purchasing a special adapter. The adapter was expensive relative to the cost of the carrier itself, and from the description I was concerned whether this would securely hold a bike on a bumpy road (such as any SF Bay Area Hwy). Fortunately, Amazon accepted the return at no charge.
Heavy Duty Carrier: We have two older model ten (10) speeds that weigh almost 50 pounds each. This rack supports them with no trouble. When the hitch bolt is tightened to hold the rack rigid, it does not move. Make sure all the nuts and bolts are fastened securely and tight before using. There is some sway when the bikes are on the rack when moving, but this would hold true of any carrier. With the removal of key pins, the arms lower, and the rack itself tilts at a 45 degree angle to allow access to the vehicle. As it is made of steel rather than aluminum, it appears to be stronger than some of the more expensive racks. You can pay more, this isn't a cheap rack, but it is doubtful you can find one any better.The only fault and it is common in hanging racks,is that when carrying a woman's bike or some hybrids, it will be necessary to be creative in methods of securing the bike to the rack. Buying a top post adapter will solve many of the bike positioning problems.
junk bike rack: bought this rack because i was told it was the best made got it assembeled per directions placed bikes on it first time straps broke on 2 of the 4 bikes on the rack and trashed my wifes new bike and tore the seat on my sons have not been able to talk to anyone with customer service was hung up on once!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Awesome Bike Rack!: Great 4-bike rack at a great price. Light enough for me to easily put on and off by myself, as a 47 year old woman, but very sturdy. Easy to snug bikes up, anti-sway works well. I can even open my back hatch on my Lexus 330, without hitting it. Get a pad lock to replace the Carter key, and it is secured to your hitch. But you still need to lock your bikes onto the rack with a cable, if you leave them. Excellent product!
Will not fit most bikes.: This rack is sturdy and well built, but has a major flaw. The support arms are too wide to accomodate most modern bikes. Even with the top tube adapter (which I also purchased) there is still not enough clearance to fit smaller frame bikes on the rack. I'm not talking about children's bikes, but smaller frame adult bikes. The rubber cradles help cushion and secure the bike, but they are also bulky and it is difficult to fit the bikes over them. If you have large frame bikes with straight top tubes the rack works fine, but with the modern road bikes and mountain bikes with sloping top tubes the fit is difficult, even with the adapter. If the support arms were about 3 to 4 inches closer together the rack would be perfect, but the way it is now it's almost useless for many bikes.
good product: Seems like a solid product (especially for the price) and was easy to install. Tilt-back feature works as intended and is very simple to use. I am satisfied with my purchase.
What i expected: Happy with the product. However, in the description it said that the disk had no scratches just minor bends on the case corners. I played the disk and found that there are minor scratches, causing quick skips in a few songs.
MJ Off The Wall Album: It's great, although I thought I was getting an original copy, it's actually a remastered LP. The record was packed with lot's of care so it wouldn't break. It was in peak condition when it arrived. The only flaw was that the album jacket was ripped about 5 inches on the side.
The horror fetish crew is back...: Being a fan of this band for quite a while, i kne just what to expect and thats exectly what i got and was very pleased with my choise. It seems doe, the songs are more brutal and faster and that made me very happy. Strictly for morticians fans and horro movie fanatics. Get mortician albums specialy their latest re-animated flesh...
ehhh....: Man...i've tried and tried...but Mortician sucks...I mean Musically they are extremely talented, the samples kick ass, but the vocals are terrible and every song sounds the same...do yourself a favor and pick up a Gorgoroth album, Berzerker, or even some Impaled Nazarene...but put the Mortician album down..cuz the only thing you will get is this feeling that you want your money back...
Nice sequel to White Apples: I'm a big Jonathan Carroll fan, ever since I readThe Land of Laughs: A Novel. Carroll manages to mix mundane with mystical in a very charming way. Glass Soup continues whereWhite Applesleft the story of Vincent, Isabelle and their child messiah. This makes recommending this book very straightforward: if you've read White Apples and enjoyed it, Glass Soup is a must read book. If you haven't read White Apples, start there.That said, I think this is quite a worthy sequel to White Apples. The story is quite as odd and profound as it was before. Carroll weaves the events beautifully, as the main characters travel around Vienna and cross the borders between life and death. There's odd humour, curious characters, and fairly deep thinking. The opening of the book is delightfully surreal.
The best book I read in 2005!: I give major credit to the people who can write really long reviews. I can't. But I can tell you that this was an amazing book! I stumbled across Jonathan Carroll through a Listmania list, and I'm glad I did. For a completely unique point of view, and a great story, read this book.
My review: I bought this book for a friend,she loved it! She said that it is her favorite book and that everybody should read it.! :)
Couldn't get into this one: I've anxiously awaited every Jonathan Carroll since I got hooked reading From The Teeth of Angels back in 91. But his later works have started to dim that anticipation. From Marriage of Sticks until this book, my enjoyment seems to be on a steadily downward path.What drew me to Carroll was his fantastic ability to create a scene from the "normal" world, and then show us what really lies underneath. The fantastic and metaphysical that turns the first view on its head.With this book he seems to jump into a swirling pool of the metaphysical and it doesn't seem to bear any relation to the "normal" world. If others enjoy that type of book, good. But for me it is unsettling enough that I'll read reviews before I automatically pick up the next Carroll book (unless its a reprint of an earlier great work that I've not been able to acquire yet).
An Absolutely Necessary Tool for the Classroom: There really isn't any need to spend significant space on the overall quality of this product; Crayola is a known brand with high standards which follow through to this as well. What is more important is expressing how important it is for schools to incorporate the multicultural coloring products into their classrooms. It is not easy to find these products outside of online and catalogue venues (which is unfortunate), however it is critical for young students of color (or Caucasian students, for that matter) to have a full range of options when asked (as they so often are) to draw themselves, their family, or their general community. The 10 shades offered here help them do that accurately.
Amazing: Crayola is always knowing for making a really good product. Great price too. I would purchase it again for sure.
Save Your Money-A Failed Experiment: All hail John Mayall, but no one's perfect.This album demonstrates the truth of that cliche.I bought this record blind in high school because I knew of Mayall's reputation and I stupidly didn't want to have the same Mayall albums all my friends had. The title of this album is accurate-Mayall is recalling his youth from middle age.A good deal of his youth appears to have been spent masturbating and fantasizing about sex.That's inescapable-the lyrics of "Wish I Knew a Woman" frankly describe an adolescent Mayall"jacking off pretending I'm the lover of them all"as he stares at the pinups hanging on his walls.The tunes are flat and the songs simply don't swing.This isn't rock and it fails as blues. Sorry I can't find a way to sugarcoat this, but the album stinks.I'm sure Mayall would be the first to admit that in his career he's put out some duds.This album doesn't come off at all.Grab "Bluesbreakers" or one of his other classics instead.
Truely a remarkable woman: I also bought this book in Auschwitz. I read is as soon as I bought it. While touring through the concentration camps you see all the horrible things that these people had to go through. But when you read the book, you experience the whole thing again, but with more heart. You go through the steps with Halina, you cry and you can almost feel what she felt. She is a remarkable woman for not possessing hatred, instead she encourages love and wisdom. Because of Halina I have become a more understanding person.
Get it: Great book easy to read and easy on the eyes. The pages get easily dirty so you gotta keep it in a place that doesn't get very dusty.
Fabulous and clear!: As a retired high school teacher of 10th and 11th grades, I wish I had had this resource for my students. More formal usage books are not only colder and more frightening-looking but are usually much less functional than this book in actually helping the student to write clearly and well. I wish that I had written it!
A very good basic grammar: With a few exceptions, this book is an excellent guide to proper usage. If you need to brush up on your grammar and punctuation, this will do quite nicely.
Hmmmm...: Since there was a series of albums in the early 1960s, all with the same title ("A Meiga Elizete"), it would be great if the song titles were included, so potential customers could know which record they would be getting. I've heard the first album in the series (which has "Vai Querer" and "Projecao" as the first two tracks...) and it is quite nice!
One of George Winstons's Best CDs: While I don't especially enjoy solo piano music as a rule, I do enjoy most of George Winston's compositions and his playing style. And Winter into Spring is one of his very best.
disapointed: I have his album December which I love this one however is not good I was actually relieved when a few of the songs were finished
Winston: a discovery!: I had never before heard of George Winston. By chance I heard his "February Sea" on the radio and was enchanted by it. I immediately looked for this piece and was delighted to find it. I now often listen to all of the compositions on this CD and enjoy them every time.
Winter: My reiki therapist recommended this CD so I bought it. Booo.. Being a music lover and a pianist, I would say don't get this...it lacks substance and melody.
Winter into Spring.: The music quality is great. This was given as as gift and the receiver has already listened to it and and is happy with the enhancement.
Winston always a classy composer and performer: This is one of the better George Winston albums. It has variety, but most of the selections are bright and interesting, and some of the melodies are recognizable as well.
Hotchkiss: This record is interesting in that it features two young, soon-to-be major figures in the jazz world: Donald Byrd and Phil Woods. The program was performed at a school and, only later, recorded. George Wallington is a powerful lead and is supported nicely, but this record is not for those looking for "easy listening" since there are no "standards" either pop or jazz; this is hard bop.
do not buy this item: this item is not at all what it is cracked up to be. i bought this item in my 5th month and tried to use it and i could not hear a thing, so i thought well maybe i am using it too early...i waited and decided to try again later. i am now in my 9th month and still cannot hear anything. the only sound you are able to hear is your stomach digesting food and if the baby moves you can hear it hit the walls of your uterus. well who wants to hear the baby move. you can feel that. please take my advice....do not do not do not spend your money on this product....it doesnt work. thank you
Don't waste your money: My husband and I are awaiting the birth of our first baby. I am so excited and anxious which makes me a sucker for products like this. I bought the listener at 5 months. The only noises you can hear are stomach noises and that's only when there is no static. I am now 8 months and have still failed to hear the heartbeat. I can't tell you the countless nights I have laid in bed listening and trying to hear the heartbeat. The microphone and cd are nice. I have used those. But overall, the set is a big waste of money. I was very disappointed.
SAVE YOUR MONEY !!!!!!: I wasted a lot of time trying to find my baby's heartbeat with this useless piece of equipment. And it would have caused a lot of worry if my baby was not moving while I was trying to listen. It was a real let down.
MINUS ONE STAR/ DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: We were so excited to buy this only to find out you can't hear anything except amplified noise in the room and my pulse. I am 8 months now and this product only made me worry from the minute I tried it when I did not hear either twin's heartbeat at 5 months! I still can't hear anything with it. Even my doctor & nurses say it's a waste of money. A big disappointment / the only thing I used it for is to play music for the babies which I can do with a CD player, headphones & my own classical CD's. If there was a 'no star' rating, this product would take the cake. Save your money & buy something else that will benefit your baby in the long run.
A Star is too much credit for this product...: I bought this item and tried to hear my baby's heart beat but the only thing i got was a little thump, which if you read the manual it says that a kick sounds like a thump, well no it wasn't my baby kicking; it's the sound of your finger holding down the activate button(incase your wondering, even in a quiet room it picks up any little noise that happens outside your window etc...). I put it over my heart and it did detect it then i put it on my thigh and GUESS WHAT I HEARD?? THUMP THUMP, unless my baby's kicks echos throughout my whole body than i would've kept this product and treasured it, but in my opinion (take it if you want thats whay it's an opinion)I would buy something else that'll come to more use for you or your unborn baby or other children you might have.
Utter Crap: I wish I had seen these reviews before I bought it. Please heed the reviews, and do not buy. Positively worthless.
Piece of junk-don't waste your money: We were so excited when we found this item,but we were sadly disappointed. We thought it would be great-but now I am 8 and a half months pregnant and we cannot hear anything-NOT EVEN OUR OWN HEARTBEATS. Do not waste your time or money on this item.
Thumbs Down: My husband and I are very disappointed with this product. We cannot hear the baby's heartbeat at 33 weeks, we can only hear my heartbeat. We bought this product to do what it is advertised to do, and it doesn't. We sometimes use the music and headphones, hopefully my baby enjoys that aspect of it.
Do not waste you money!: I am a first time mom-to-be, I thought this would be a wonderful thing to have. I was wrong, I have not heard anything but my food digesting or my stomach growling! This is a complete waste of money! I put the monitor on my husband and my dogs and I heard the same noises I hear in my own tummy! Do not buy it!
It's fetustacular!!: Man, if you love fetuses as much as I do ... then you're probably going to like this product ... a lot. Love would be a more appropriate word. As in, 'I love this product'.
Company should take product off market!: After trying to conceive for over 2 years, this was given to my husband and I as a gift. Anxious we starting listening for the baby heart beat as soon as the doctor could hear it with the doppler. I am now 37 weeks pregnant and no heartbeat, can not even hear our own heartbeat, our dogs or cat. This is a complete waste of money; I hate that my friends spent their money on it! I contacted the company and they said that you should be able to hear the baby's heart beat at 5 months. I told her that I am 37 weeks and still not hearing anything. The representative, Millie, did not seem to care or offer any suggestions. This type of product is offering false hopes, false advertising and the company should take it off the market!!!
A complete waste of money and time.: A real disappointment. We got our hopes up and tried for months to hear the heartbeat. Now 29 weeks, still nothing but horrible static and every creak of the movements of the cords and my hands! impossible to avoid! If im lucky, the only thing heard over the static is my digestive system. woo hoo! anyways, this thing picks up conversations of people in the next room as well as any TV or music playing in the house. Such a let down! and we're mad that we wasted our money.
Doesn't pick up heartbeat well: I am 34 weeks pregnant and have only heard his heartbeat three times with it. It amplifies every movement of the cord and the clicking on/off button is very loud. I do like that my son reacts to it and kicks wherever I place the amplifier piece so that has been the only benefit. If I haven't felt the baby move in a while I will use this and sure enough he will kick it and I know he is alright. Unfortunetly that is not the only thing I wanted it for- I really wanted to hear the heartbeat. My midwife says not to use it very much because the babies don't like the feedback it produces. Don't order it expecting great results.
Save your money!: I am now 33 weeks pregnant and have never been able to hear my baby's heartbeat with this device. My husband and I have both read the directions thoroughly and neither of us has had any luck. We try it all the time, so it cannot be that the baby is in a bad position. The only thing we can hear is my own stomach growling. I agree with the other reviews to just buy a cheap stethoscope.
28 Weeks and still can't hear a thing: We can't hear anything with this monitor - not even our own hearts with the receiver right over our chests! My mother-in-law, who's a nurse, said that at this point in my pregnancy a cheap stethoscope would work better. We're disappointed that we spent the money on something that we had been excited to try.
Wish I read reviews first: I thought this would be a great purchase, but found that I am unable to hear the heartbeat. I hear all the other noises in the room but not the baby, wish I didn't waste my money.
What a waste: I received this as a shower gift and was really anxious to use it. At 8 months pregnant I couldnt hear a thing. I moved the microphone everywhere on my belly and nothing. It does however pick up every sound in the neighborhood. Don't even think of buying this piece of junk!
basically useless: When I first saw the Bebe Sounds prenatal listener, I knew that I had to have it! The idea of being able to listen to my little one's heartbeat at home was thrilling. Every month, I had loved going to my prenatal appointments just so I could hear her. Unfortunately, I tried time and again with this device and was unsuccessful in ever really knowing what I was hearing. I tried from week 20 until 34 weeks when I just gave up. Although I followed all of the directions, this product only helped me hear one thing - my husband complaining about all the money I wasted!!! Please don't make the same mistake. If you want to hear a heartbeat, rent a doppler like your health care provider has. Check the classified ads in mom/baby fitness magazines. I wish I had.
Don't Waste Your Money: I purchased this in my 5th month of pregnancy and I am now in my 8th month. The only thing that I have heard with it is my own heartbeat and the sounds of my own stomach growling . When I visit the doctor, my baby's heartbeat is very strong and loud but I have not been able to get ANYTHING with this. In my opinion, it is a waste of money and time.
PLEASE dont waste your money: We were anxious and wanted to hear our baby's heatbeat at home, but were shy at spending the money to buy the more expensive dopplers so we got this. PLEASE check out Baby Beats.com - for as little as $20 you can rent a doppler just like the one they use at the Dr.s office!!! This one is very poor sound quality, and we were frustrated very quickly. By 28 weeks you may be able to hear the baby's heartbeat just by puttin' your ear to the belly, but before then just get a doppler!!
Only because 0 stars isnt an option: WARNING - YOU CAN'T EASILY RETURN THIS PRODUCT IF IT DOESNT WORK.I bought this at ~ 20 weeks because I was getting concerned when I couldn't feel her move. I am now 30 weeks, and I still can't hear a heartbeat with it. What a piece of junk. There is absolutely no sound insulation on the monitor itself, so the pressure of your finger as you hold down the button makes more noise than anything inside you does. The only thing I was ever able to hear was stomach sounds when I had indigestion. I tried for over an hour the other day, being very careful not to let the monitor or cord touch anything and still couldn't hear a thing. Then I tried listening to my own heartbeat. It was barely louder/clearer then when I lay my ear on my husbands chest.
Good tool.: This product specifically says in the directions that you may not always be able to hear the heartbeat (depending on the baby's position). My husband and I appreciated this product because we were able to speak to the baby through the speakers and play music. If you have that desire than this is a great product to buy! As far as what you hear...you'll hear his movements, and may occasionally hear his heart beating, but don't buy it just for that, you will be disappointed if you plan to listen to the beating consistantly.
Zero Stars, if possible.: I also purchased the Bebe Prenatal listener from another store. I just returned it today. I tried it everynight as detailed in the users manual and only heard faint wooshing and my digestive noise. Never heard anything as described in the manual...kicks, hiccups or the heartbeat. My husband was always worried that I could not hear the heartbeat and I had to calm him saying "the manual says it may take awhile to hear it or that we would not hear the heart beat everyday".... Well that got old, my baby moves all the time and at some point, the heart should have been in a favorable position for me to hear it. The manual stresses to read the directions closely and don't get discouraged...2 months of trying at 6 + months was enough. It only took one month to get pregnant, and that should be the effort, not trying to hear on this device. I'm buying a stethoscope tomorrow from a medical supply store as I've already missed out on 2 months of hearing the heartbeat at home.
a waste...: As many others have stated, this product is NOT worth a penny. It's a waste of plastic unless you're interested in hearing the quietest sounds around you rather than baby.I've heard people say that it might depend on the weight of mom, but I can tell you, that is not true at all. I'm a thin woman, and not once did I hear baby's heartbeat, and I tried EVERY DAY, until my last month when I finally gave up. Baby was moving so much that I didn't need to hear the heartbeat to know everything was ok.Save your money on something more useful. And if you're that concerned about hearing baby's heartbeat, try renting a doppler from a hospital or typing something like "rent fetal heart doppler" in a google search and rent one online.
Horrible waste of money: I purchased this in hopes of hearing my little one. I am well into my third trimester and so far all I can hear on it is the noises from every part of the house. The instructions indicated I would be able to hear movements and hiccups as well as the heartbeat. The baby has kicked the monitor and it hasn't sounded, but if I move my finger at all on the button I hear that. I hope no one else wastes their money on this.
mostly useless: Mostly useless says it all.Spend the money on something eles.If the lovely sounds of amniotic woosh woosh wooshing, or your own gasses burbling is your thing, buy this item. You will love it.If you want to hear the bebies heart beat, you MIGHT catch it FAINTLY in the last trimester... if the baby is facing you... and the stars are in the proper alignment... if you are lying on your back (which you arent supposed to be doing anyway) and the fates smile on the moment.Me, id rather spend all that time "counting kicks" to keep watch on baby.It picks up the TV in the other room JUST GREAT though.
Disappointed: I wish I had read the reviews on this website before I bought this product. I was so excited after hearing my baby's heartbeat at the doctor's office that I ran right out and bought this product when I was just 3 months pregnant. When I got it home and read the directions I learned that it wouldn't work until I was at least 5 months pregnant. I started using it at five months and still to this day 32 weeks into my pregnancy have never heard my baby's hearbeat using this product. All my husband and I have ever heard is loud clicking noises when pushing the button and static every time the cord moves slightly. Don't waste your money!
Not worth the money: We bought this product when I was 28 weeks pregnant. My husband is convinced he has heard the heartbeat, but I'm not sure. We definitely hear lots of other noises, but whether it's my digestive system or the baby, I don't know. I am now almost 34 weeks pregnant and we'll try again to hear it this week, but I am not very confident. We bought just the monitor, not the gift set. All I can say is, maybe it will work in the next few weeks, but I would never buy it again.
ehh..: I never heard a heart beat with this device. Money thrown down the drain & purchase regreted :(
don't waste your money!!: i don't normally write reviews but this thing is a piece of junk and i wanted to do whatever i could to keep others from wasting their money. all you hear is generic noise. i am now 36 weeks....one month from delivery and i never heard a heartbeat. i would always try right after getting back from the doctor's office and hearing a heartbeat. nothing.
HUNK OF JUNK!!!!!: WHAT A RIP-OFF!!! I would actually give this product LESS than one star if I could. I was so eager to buy this product, but my 9-month pregnant girlfriend insisted I shouldn't waste my money, and instead gave me hers a few days before she delivered. It never worked for her, and now, at 7 months along, it still hasn't worked for me. All I can hear is gurgling-type noises, which sound EXACTLY the same as when I hold the device up to my HUSBAND'S stomach! I have lots of pregnant girlfriends, and I have yet to find a single person who has used this product with any amount of success. If you really want to clearly hear and acurately measure your baby's heartbeat at home, consider renting a doppler device instead, (see babybeat.com or storkradio.com). These devices are of doctor's-office-quality, and you can rent them for around $30 a month. Otherwise, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THE BEBE SOUNDS!!!! THIS PRODUCT IS A JOKE!!!!
worst baby product ever: We have purchased this item when I was 5 months pregnant and even though my baby has a really strong heart beat, i was never able to detect the heart beat with this prenatal listener... It was such a waste......I could've spend that $50 on something much better....
Don't Bother: At 30 weeks pregnant, I thought for sure that I would be able to hear the baby's heartbeat. I hear the movement of the monitor's cord, the creaking of the joint in my finger, and the slight movement of the monitor over my stomach as I inhale and exhale, but I don't hear the heartbeat. It is very frustrating to try to use this product. It says to be patient, and I am a very patient person, but I know when something isn't going to work -- and this won't work, no matter how many times I try. I would not recommend this thing to anyone. Don't waste your time or money!
37 weeks pregnant and never heard a thing!: This was a gift from a friend early on in pregnancy. Nice thought, but such a waste of money. I have NEVER heard the heartbeat, and I am now 37 weeks pregnant. I feel my baby kicking, but cannot hear the heartbeat on this thing. There are many other things I would recommend giving as a gift, like pregnancy pillows for sleeping, but not this. If you ask me, it's just another wasteful product geared for eager first time parents. Wanna hear the heartbeat? Your doctor can do that for you at each visit.
save your money and your hopes: Luckily, I did not buy this product. My mother bought it for me hoping to hear the sounds of her first grandchild's heart. I am currently 35 weeks and have not heard the heart. I hear the rumblings of movement, I hear the creaking in the joint of my finger as I hold the button down, alas, no heartbeat. I have been very let down by this product, as has my mother. I followed the instructions to the letter (they stress in the instructions that you cannot use the product without following every word of their instructions).What a bummer product this is.
Needs improvement: We bought this product and very dissapointed that you can hardly hear the heartbeat. I don't recommend buying this product!
waste of money!: If I could have given this 0 stars I would have. My husband and I purchased this, thinking we would be able to hear the baby's heartbeat. We tried as early as 3 months, and only heard the usual gurgling and swooshing noises. Even at 8 months, we still couldn't find the heartbeat, but we could hear a plane flying overhead! Total waste of money!!! Use a stethescope, it works alot better!
Don't Waste Your Money: I never write reviews but felt compelled to write this one. I was very excited to learn that I could hear my first baby's heartbeat without waiting to go to the doctor's office. I purchased this product and I am now in my 25th week and can hear EVERYHING but the baby's heartbeat. This product is such a waste of time. I wish that I could return it.
Total waste of money!: I am 36 weeks pregnant, and have yet to hear anything from this monitor. At the drs office, the baby's heartbeat comes in loud and clear; with this all I hear is background noise. NOT worth it at all, I would have rather spent the money on something for the baby! Do not waste your money!
needs improvements: We purchased the prenatal listener deluxe set with the hopes of listening to our baby's heartbeat and movements. So far we have heard nothing except static and the gurgles of my stomach. The button, which you have to hold down constantly, is a major pain. If there is any noise what so ever in the room, the listener amplifies it into your headphones. I am a nurse and I'm accustomed to finding fetal heartones with a doppler and I can not get this thing to pick anything up. I even placed it over my own heart and barely could hear that! I would not recommend this product for purchase with the intent of listening to your baby. The only thing that I have found useful are the speakers that come with the set. They can be plugged into a cd player and you can play music for your baby. This is the only useful thing about this product. If you ask me, it's too {costly}e for a pair of tiny speakers. Maybe at 40 weeks I'll pick something up!
Love It -- My Guesses at others problems w/ device :): ... I am 27 weeks pregnant and have no trouble at all hearing the heartbeat. Like the pediatrician said earlier, maybe some people do it at the wrong time or look in all the wrong spots. My baby kicks and reacts to the device too- but try a stethoscope!! They kick at that too!! ...My husband and I love the machine... It's really worth it for the CHANCE you might though. ...
This is Great!: My wife and I love listening to our baby's heartbeat. But more inportant than that is playing the Mozart music to the baby. We are so exited about giving her a head start on life. How wonderful to start playing the music aand to see her react while still in the womb. There is no question in my mind that she is hearing and learning while she is only eight months old.
Complete waste of money and time!: I have never been able to hear a baby's heartbeat with this device, in fact, I don't think I heard anything, on slight occasion, I heard my own heartbeat when held to my chest - just to make sure it even worked, I work in OB, so you think I would be able to find a baby heartbeat, I found dissapointment instead.Not useful, Not even amusing or entertaining.
Don't buy this product!: I purchased this product when I was only a few months pregnant. I thought that I would be able to at least hear something around 20 weeks. Well, I am now 38 weeks (two weeks until my due date) and I still cannot hear much. Just this week I started hearing something, but who knows if it is really the heartbeat! If you really want to hear your babies heartbeat I recommend renting a doppler. You can get one online and use them from 12 weeks on! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY: Don't let this product fool you, like it fooled me. First Time pregnant and I bought into the whole thing, wanted to hear the baby everyday etc.... Well I didn't hear a thing. You just have to wait for the doctor's appointments
What a waste of my time and money!!: We got this item when I was 6months pg with our daughter, we never heard anything on it except the static from moving your finger when holding the button down. I definitly would not recommend this item to anyone who is pregnant. I couldn't even hear my own heartbeat or my husbands. I only wish that I could get the money back, that would buy a lot of diapers which is something I could really use.
Horrible!!!: This item is absolutely Horrible!! Don't waste your money. My husband and I were never able to hear our babies heartbeat. We would only hear alot of swooshing. You can pick up your own heartbeat with no problem though. We would only try using it the day before I had a doctors appointment because I would get so discouraged and start worrying that we couldn't hear the heartbeat, so at least I knew the next day I would be reassured at the doctors. I am 36 weeks now and still can't pick it up. I don't even bother trying anymore. It's a waste of time, money and just causes you aggravation.
A piece of junk!: I thought that I would get some peace of mind being able to hear my baby's heartbeat with this product. BOY WAS I WRONG! I totally wasted my money! I want to try and return it. All I heard was some loud, obnxious clanks! And I heard these sounds regardless of what I put it up to...stomach, chest, arm, leg, etc. And the product instructions say that you can hear when the baby moves and kicks Well, I watched my stomach jump from the baby's movements, while using the device and didn't hear a darn thing. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS THING! IT DOES NOTHING!
Doesn't Work at ALL: We only use this to play music to our baby, because we have been trying for 10 weeks to hear his heartbeat with it, to no avail. I can barely hear my own heartbeat!The strap and headphones are nice for playing music, but that's about it.Don't waste your money on this. It's horrible. And, you can't take it back!!!
Barely even picks up mother's heartbeat!!!: Expected it to be something like Doctor's doppler. It is just a weak sound amplifier with no filtering. It picks up external sounds like the hum of the refrigerator and the dryer very well. You just touch the outside of the unit and the sound is amplified louder than anything else. Mother's heartbeat is faint and muffled. Did not hear a single heartbeat or any kind of Baby sound. It did not even pick up visible baby kicks. Don't waste your money.
Don't waste your time or money!: I was so excited to get this as a gift, until I tried it. I may as well get two paper cups and connect them to a string instead!It is absolutely useless!!!! It doesn't matter how far along you are, my friend is about 81/2 months pregnant and can't hear a thing either!Diana
Waste of money!: This monitor is horrible. My wife and I tried to hear the baby's heartbeat everyday since the third month. She is now six months and we still can't hear anything more than sounds from our own movement, the air conditioner, kitten's purring, cars driving by, aircraft flying overhead, and the neighbors flushing the toilet. The only baby sounds we heard was the "swooshing" sound from blood moving through the placenta. My wife and I once thought we could hear a heart beat but were disappointed to find it was her own pulse from an artery near her waistline. This product says you should be able to hear the heartbeat and other baby sounds (i.e. hiccups, gurgles, and kicks) during the 2nd trimester (5th month). I do not recommend this product to anyone. It would be a great item if it worked for more than 1 out of 50 people.
Don't Buy!!!: Do not buy the Bebe Sonds Prenatal Listerner. This product does not work, even on medium sound. The only thing this product did was make my wife worry that something was wrong with our son. Even at 8 months, it still doesn't work yet the baby is alive and kicking. This thing is a joke and a waste of money. So don't even think that it will work for you and that you should give it a try. This company should be sued.
what are these people thinking: this item is only good for ease-dropping. it is better than a glass to the wall. doc says half of the peeps think they are hearing the baby, but are really hearing their heart...which can beat fast at times...especially after you bother with this thing long enough and get frustrated. after 4 weeks i bought a doppler on ebay for $130, you can get them now for $70ish. if you rent they are $20-50 per month.
DOES NOT WORK: i don't know how anyone found enjoyment out of this product. we tried it on several different occasions from 29wks to 39wks and never had any success. it was a terrible waste of our money. don't buy it. you can have mine.
Not So Helpful: We were anxious to hear the baby's heartbeat. This listener will not provide you with what you expect to hear. I could only use it for the last few weeks of the pregnancy. In order to hear anything you must be in a silent room and have ultrasonic hearing. You can hear a faint heartbeat in your 9th month if you practice often. It is not worth it. Invest and rent the dobbler if you need real reinforcent on a regular basis especially from early on.
Complete Waste of Money!: This is a piece of junk! I absolutely do not recommend this product. My husband bought it for me and it is awful! We have tried and tried again to hear our son's heartbeat! I am 25 weeks pregnant, and the packaging says you will be able to hear the heartbeat at 20 weeks! All we can hear is static. It makes the same sound if you put it on your arm! This item is a peice of junk! Do not waste your money!
Mom and Dad to be in FL.: I wouln't have rated it even 1 star but I had to put something. This is the worse thing I've ever bought. What a waste of $$. I purchased it for my excited husband hoping he could hear something, But from 5 mo. to now 8 mo. along, we still don't hear anything but a gurgulling belly. Mine! Even now in the eighth month we don't even hear a heartbeat, that at the Dr. office is loud and very strong. I know this isn't medical level equipment but, please, don't buy this. You WILL be disappointed.
waste of money: I am six months pregnant and still cannot hear my baby's heartbeat. I do enjoy using the fetal speakers and mic to play music and read to my baby. He gets very excited when hearing my voice; however, I purchased this item mainly to hear his heartbeat. I wish I had read the reviews prior to purchasing ...you will NOT hear your child's heartbeat with this monitor.
Quiet as a Mouse, Still as a Rock: I just bought the prenatal listen by itself and was dissapointed that I had to hold the monitor and the button down the whole time I was trying to listen. Any slight movement of your hand or finger while holding the device or pressing the button can sound like a kick. This thing takes alot of patience but if you can be still as a rock, quiet as a mouse you can hear the baby's movements, I haven't been able to hear baby's heartbeat yet, just my own and I'm 20 wks.
Disappointing!: We bought this item in spite of the mixed reviews it had gotten, so in retrospect, this is one item we could have done without! We've used the CDs and microphone to read stories to our little one, but have had absolutely NO luck hearing the fetal heartbeat. I think half an hour is the longest time we spent in search of a sound other than my gurgling digestive tract.You're better off going to your regular prenatal visits and relying on the midwife/dr to hear the heartbeat. You can also ask if you can attach a mini cassette recorder into the doppler to record the heartbeat.
Waste of money: I thought the first one I got was defected...so I took it back and got another one. Well...it didn't work AT ALL for me! I was (and still am) VERY dissapointed! What a waste of time and money!
Nice idea, but...: We were looking forward to purchasing this item to hear our baby's heart beat. Unfortunately, we haven't had much luck with it... it's hard to find the heart beat, you can hear any external sounds and even hear your hand moving around on the device. We're going to keep trying though... maybe it will work sometime in the 7 weeks before our baby is due...
Piece of Junk: Luckily, we borrowed this item from someone, rather than buying it. Don't waste your money. I'm into my 3rd trimester, and I know both where to listen and what to listen for to pick up the baby's heartbeat, and I have yet to find it with this monitor. All I hear is static from the foam cover, interference from moving the monitor around, and sometimes my own stomach. Even when I know the baby is moving and active, I still can't pick up the heartbeat. Definitely NOT a recommended product.
DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT: My wife and I are having twins and we bought this early on (month 3). The only heartbeat I've ever hear is my own hearbeat, testing to see if this actually works. My babies are perfectly fine, and when I go to the doctor's office, they're always fine...but with this device, the only thing I get is disappointment. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
Bad Product that doesn't deliver: This Prenatal heart listener is junk.All you hear is Stomach and Intestine noises. I Would buy a book or something instead.
Waste of time and money: I bought this product at 4 months, I couldn't wait to use it. I am now 8 months pregnant and haven't heard any sign of a heart beat, I hear my food digesting though to remind me of how fat I am now. Don't waste your time or the money. By yourself a weight watchers package deal for after the baby comes...
Love it!: I bought this set for myself & I absolutely love it! While you can't hear baby's heartbeat as clearly as you do at the dr's office you can hear the heartbeat & kicks, I also love the microphone piece. My husband reads our baby girl books before we go to bed at night. I haven't used the tape or CD as of yet but I think this set is a great buy!!
Very Disappointed: I haven't been able to hear the heartbeat once and I am 26 weeks along. At first it scared me to use the monitor and not hear anything but the cars passing outside. Waste of money!
bebe sounds does not work: I was upset when I brought bebesounds from kmart I am 16 weeks and I have not heard anything but a whole bunch of noise in my tummy I almost got scared when i did not here anything but it may be to early and everyone else has had a problem with this device I wish I can bring it back to the store and get my dam money back. I hope I dont sound mean but this really upset me when you buy something and it does not work they way it shuold.
I cant Believe so many bad reiviews: I bought this product when I was PG with my first child 2 years ago and loved it. It did take a few times to hear the heartbeat, but once I figured out how it worked, it was more easy to find in future uses. I found that I was turning the valume to high and once I fixed that mistake all the background noise went doun. I recomend u put in on the middle valume setting. I loned it to a friend and she says she cant here the heartbeat, so I dont understand why some can and some cant. I am PG again and will be bying another since my friend boke my old one. I would recomend this product, but dont waste youre money on the deluxe model, just for incase u are one of thouse who cant figure it out.
This does NOT work: I tried this stupid thing from 20 weeks all the up until my DUE DATE! I heard everything BUT my baby's heard beat...I was so upset. Please, just rent a doppler from somewhere. Save yourself the frustration during pregnancy.
NEVER WORKED: Ive had 2 pregnancys and My sister in law and I were pregnant at the same time. We both would try using this monitor and never heard anything but ourselves. Mine doubled as a toy for my 2 year old. Dont waste your money.
Don't waste your money: My husband bought me this gift set so that we could listen to the babies heart beat and play the baby Mozart. We could never find the babies heartbeat even after just being to the doctor and knowing the everything was ok. (This item just enhances the paranoidness of the parents-to-be thinking that everything is not ok because you can't find the heartbeat.)As for the playing the baby music you can do the same thing with your CD player or tape deck and a cheap pair of headphone to place on your belly.Again do not waste your money.
WAY too sensitive... don't bother: That horrendous sound you're hearing is actually the tiny bit of friction in the nuckles of your fingers because this device is SO sensitive, it will pick up EVERYthing. We found it to be so rediculously sensitive that it was impossible to differentiate the baby's heartbeat from other sounds such as the mother's digestive system. The worst part was trying to keep still enough to eliminate these parasitic noises. Even the most impercievable joint movement in the user's hand is picked up loud enough to block out all other sounds. Spend your money on something else.
useless: I do not own the bebe sounds deluxe kit, but I own the regular one-headset version and IT DOES NOT WORK. Do yourself a favor and buy something you really need with the money you would be wasting on this.
Total waste of money: I finally found the heartbeat after about a month of trying, and it is EXTREMELY faint. A stethoscope would do better. For $49 at the store, I am extremely disappointed. Spend the extra money and get a doppler.
Listen to 99% of the reviews -- Not worth it!: I bought this set for my husband for Christmas b/c I thought it would be cool for him to hear the baby whenever he wanted to. I spent the extra $$$ on the deluxe set b/c of the fact I could play music to the baby. Well, I was 6 months pregnant and we couldn't find a heartbeat anywhere. Even if the room is totally silent we still couldn't find it and I read the instructions! I bought it online for $40 and am selling it now on Ebay for 1/2 that. I'm in my 8th month and still don't hear anything. I guess I just was hoping I'd get it to work. Don't bother.
Grandmom says BUY IT: I bought this for my daughter who is expecting my first grandchild. She got it when she was about 20 weeks and heard the heart beat on the second try-like many of the other reviewers said, it was much lower than she thought it would be. She enjoys playing music and talking to him, I'm still waiting for her to mail me the tape of his heartbeat-in the meantime, I'm taping my voice for him...Out of state grandparents-get it!
Waste of money and source of anxiety: DO NOT BUY. This product stinks - it doesn't work/detect until well into the pregnancy (when you are less concerned than earlier); instead, rent the better/more sensitive version. Of course, not hearing a hearbeat totally stressed you out, so save yourself the anxiety. The better (rentals) detect earlier, will give you more peace of mind when you most need it. They said they would give me a refund, but never sent it and said they didn't receive the monitor which I had shipped back to them.
Works just fine if you know how to work it: My husband and I bought this product because we were excited to hear the baby. I read the manual cover to cover and bought a brand new battery like it suggests. You just have to have patience with it. It picks up every movement of your hand on the listening part and if it touches anything like blankets or clothes then it interferes. If you're patient with it then it really works. It does take a while to find the baby's heartbeat and when you find it it is really soft so you have to listen hard. I don't think people are giving it enough time. I find the sound of my baby to be the most relaxing sound. I am in my 32nd week and insomnia keeps me up and wakes me up in the middle of the night. The sound of the baby puts me right to sleep. Also, we've found that our baby reacts to it. Our baby starts kicking where we have the bebesounds thing and it's a good way to interact with the baby. It's only $20, I would recommend it to anyone.
Great Idea Terrible Product: Waste of money and being first time parents we buy everything regardless of price. It will make you crazy because you can't hear anything and start thinking you hear something. It really is a "joke" and the people who like it must work for the company.
Disappointed: Someone gave me this monitor in the beginning of my pregnancy. I am now eight months pregnant and I have yet to find my baby's heartbeat on this monitor. I have followed the directions and it still does not work. Even in the quietest room, all I can hear is a humming and an occasional thump from my baby. Definitley a waste of money.
Not worth the money: When my husband and I got this product we couldn't wait to hear the baby's heartbeat. I was 5 months pregnant then and am 7 months now and have yet to hear it with this product. I like playing music for the baby but you can do that with just a CD player and headphones...
Does Not Work: We received this as a gift. I'm sorry my friend wasted their money. I have tried listening for something other than my own heartbeat, stomach growling and noises in the house since I was in my first trimester. I now have 4 weeks to go and have yet to hear anything related to the baby. Do not waste your money buying this product for yourself or anyone else. I think the nurse at my doctor's office summed it up best...it has no way to transfer sound. Think about it. They use gel on your belly and have direct contact with the listening device in the doctor's office. This item has a funnel with a sponge on the end. It's just not designed to transfer sound effectively. Spend your money elsewhere!
What a waste!: My husband and I tried patiently to hear SOMETHING with this thing. We finally gave up when, at 27 weeks, we both SAW the baby kick the very spot where we had the listener placed. The manual says that kicks sound like a "thud." We heard nothing but the same old "whooshing." I was shocked since this thing picks up every sound outside and around the belly loud and clear. Anyone who hears heart beat or hiccups with this listener must have a much softer internal "whooshing" going on!
Had to be on a weird angle to hear: I tried from 4.5 months through my 6 month of pregnancy to hear my child's heartbeat. Finally after numerous attempts, arching my back while sitting and placing it right above my navel I hear my child's heartbeat.
Don't waste your money!!!: My husband bought this because he wanted our almost 3 year old daughter to be able to listen to the new baby's heart beat. I am nearly 6 months along now and we have not been able to hear a thing! All we hear is gurgling sounds, popping and static. I also find that even my breathing causes interfearance and I end up holding my breath while we try to listen. This item is worthless and a HUGE waste of money.
USELESS: SINCE I WAS EIGHT WEEKS ALONG, MY OB HAS ALWAYS COMMENTED ON HOW LOUD AND STRONG MY LITTLE ONE'S HEARTBEAT IS. HERE I AM, AT 24 FULL WEEKS, AND STILL CAN'T HEAR A THING EXCEPT STATIC AND GURGLING. NOT FOR A LACK OF TRYING EITHER, I'VE SAT AND LAID IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS, TRIED 200 DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, AND EVEN TRIED A BRAND NEW BATTERY...NOTHING HAS WORKED. I WISH I HAD JUST PUT THAT MONEY TOWARDS A GOOD PEDICURE!
Worst purchase of the pregnancy!: I am now 9 months pregnant and with the exception of one time (where I THOUGHT I heard my son's heartbeat), the most I heard was the cute sounds of my intestines...and this is after spending at least 1/2 hour searching. At one point (well into my 5th month), I got excited after hearing thumps (which are supposed to be kicks), but the excitement was short lived when I put the listener on my husband's stomach and found that his stomach made the same sounds. Save yourself the money.
Not worth it: My husband and I have yet to hear our baby's heartbeat with this device. Save your money!
PIECE OF JUNK...: Dont waste your money. I bought this when I was 20 weeks pregnant and I am still trying to hear the heartbeat at 32 weeks. The only thing I can hear is my intestines growling and my dog in the other room breathing. This product is a real let-down and I do not advise anyone to buy this piece of junk...
Cannot Hear baby's heart rate!: We got this product hoping to hear the baby's heartbeat when my wife was about 4 months pregnant, but could not hear actual heartbeat. Waited until 5, 6, 7, even 8 months, tried many many times, but could not hear it! It did not work for us, I'm not sure how many people actually have success with this product. This is not like what you see in Doctor's office, those devices use different technology (doppler). Be careful since stores such as motherhood don't let you return it, so if it does not work for you, you're stuck with it!
Major Disappointment: We purchased this product early in our pregnancy. At first it was exciting to here the baby moving even though I really could not feel it. After many attempts, even up to my due date, to hear the baby's heartbeat we are very disappointed with the quality of this product. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Save your money!
Not worth it: Save your money for other things you will need once the baby has arrived! Until then wait until your next appointment with your doctor and you will be able to hear the heartbeat at the Doctor's office. Don't worry yourself silly trying to find the baby's heartbeat with this. like I did...I was however able to play music for the baby in utero, which is why it did receive 1 star. Something that I could have accomplished however with my husbands portable cd player.
Great idea...if it worked!: I tried to listen to my baby's heartbeat throughout my pregnancy and was unable to hear it, even at 8 months! It picks up all the ambient noise and can barely pick up your heartbeat and stomach sounds. Great idea, if it worked.
Piece of Garbage: I am pregnant with my first child and purchased this six months into my pregnancy. I have not been able to get this thing to work even now that I'm at nine months. I've even brought this along with me to my doctor's visit and she thought that this monitor was a piece of junk. Don't waste your time or your money with this product!!
Not happy with this product.: I purchased this product when I was 19 weeks along. The directions mentioned it works best in your third trimester. I am now 8 months pregnant & still have yet to hear my baby's heart beat using this device. There is a lot of back ground noise & interference even when the room is completely quiet. Fortunately, I am a mom/baby nurse & can listen to my baby's heartbeat at work any time I please. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
DON'T DO IT: THE MONITOR IS HARDLY WHAT WE EXPECTED IT TO BE. I WAS 6MONTHS WHEN WE BOUGHT IT & WE WERE SO EXCITED THAT WE OPENED THE PACKAGE IN THE CAR! OF COURSE THE ONLY THING WE HEARD WAS ROAD NOISE, BUT WHEN WE GOT HOME WE STILL DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING (EXCEPT STOMACH GROWLINGS & OUR OWN HEARTBEAT). THE BABY DID MOVE AROUND ALOT MORE WHEN WE LISTENED FOR HER. THE ONLY THING THAT I LIKE ABOUT THE SOUNDS MONITOR IS THAT WHEN WE USE THE DEVICE TO SPEAK TO THE BABY, SHE MOVES AROUND ALOT RIGHT NEAR THE SPEAKERS. WE READ TO HER EVERY NIGHT WITH IT & SHE SEEMS TO ENJOY IT.
awful product!: I also own the basic model with one set of headphones and it is a waste of money. My husband wanted to get one from the day we found out I was pregnant, but we waited until I was 6 months. You can't hear anything going on with the baby. Another thing isyou cannot return it to the store for any reason,it has to go directly to the manufacturer. A word to the wise, do not waste your money on this cheap item!
WASTE OF MONEY: I tried this several times throughout my pregnancy. Each time I really could not hear anything. Mostly what I hard was the moving of the device over my belly. I had to sit really still in order not to hear the device moving. I even tried it when my baby had the hiccups, I couldn't even hear that. I also had to be in a very quiet room with no one talking and the tv off. Once I heard a swooshing sound, but other than that- nothing. Don't waste your money on this one. You are better paying for a device that the midwives use.
Great idea but it didn't work for us: This is a great idea but it didn't work at all for us. We eventually gave up trying to listen for our daughter's heartbeat and just waited for our appointments to hear it. We didn't try during the last trimester because we were frustrated from the previous attempts.
Wasteless Item: When me and my husband passed this item in the store I was told that it was a terrific buy. I believe that associate was new or wanted us to waste our money because we could not find the babys heartbeat if our life depended on it! I was completely dissapointed and sad that I could not hear my babys heartbeat at all. All I picked up was the noises surronding the room! The only thing this is good for is to hear your own heartbeat because I surely did pick that up!
Waste of money: I bought the Prenatal Heart Listener Deluxe when I was about 4 months pregnant. I am now 8.5 months pregnant and I wish I had never bought it. It was a complete waste of money. I had read reviews on it some positive and some 0, but I thought I would try it anyways. It was a waste of money for me. I NEVER heard my baby's heart beat, all I do is rely on my doctors visits. I see her kicking all the time, but I never hear her kicking. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody.The only good thing would be the microphone that is included so that you can talk to your baby, but you can pick that up a lot cheaper!
Don't waste your money!!!: This item was the biggest waste of moeny!! I bought it at 24 weeks gestation and am now 34 weeks along and have been ATTEMPTING to use it faithfully...but all I hear is my stomach gurgling (big whoop) and my hearbeat. And, the headset is now starting to go out on it. Since it is a 'personal product' they don't offer a money back guarantee. Pay the extra money to rent a medical doppler and you'll be happier.
Do not buy this product. Listen to people review.: I always wanted to get this product even though I read all review and this product has a poor review but I believed those couple people who gave good reviews. Do not buy this product. I bought this product when I was 4.5 months pregnant. My husband and I tried this product and follow the instruction almost everyday for 2 weeks. You cannot hear the fetal's heartbeat but everything else. You can't hear your own hearteat when you put it against your chest. I was going to keep it for the Microphone but by 6 months my baby can hear everything outside the womb. I can just play the music from the CD player and the baby can hear it. So we returned the product. Please don't buy this product just keep your money for those Baby Mozart and other classical music CDs.
Return to Unisar for REFUND!!!!: Like so many others, I wasn't able to hear my baby's heartbeat with this device and was incredibly unhappy with my purchase. As it was used, I couldn't return it to Babies-R-Us and so contacted Unisar Inc. who provided a full refund. I'm not usually one to leave reviews or contact companies about my disappointment but I was shocked by the numerous 0 reviews left on this site and the false advertising of this device. They were relatively prompt with their response and only requested that the device be returned with the receipt.
Don't waste your time: It doesn't work. I am 25 weeks right now, know where he is and I still can't hear his heartbeat. It's such a disappointment! Lucky for me, I didn't have to pay for it...
MAUREEN JENKINS 7MOS IN S.C.(THE BRUMBLE OF HUNGER): I HAD TO RATE ONE STAR BECAUSE THEY SAID SO,BUT IAM LYING TO YOU.MY BEBE SET WAS A HAND ME DOWN PARTLY BRAND NEW AT THE TIME STILL I COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING BUT MY HEARTBEAT OR GAS ROLLINGAROUND. SO GOOD THING I DIDN'T WASTE MY MONEY LIKE THE OTHERS CAUSE YOU COULD HAVE PURCHASED A SET OF BOTTLES INSTEAD. IAM VERY UPSET BECAUSE I WAS SO EXCITED AND EAGER TO HEAR MY BABY'S HEARTBEAT AND GOT NOTHING AT FIRST IT SCARED ME THAT I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING CAUSE I THOUGHT THE WORST AND PANIC! I WORRIED SO BADLY I CALLED THE OBGYN AND SCHELDULED AN APPT. I WAS AT EASE WHEN I HEARD HIS HEARTBEAT AND WHEN I GOT HOME I THREW IT AWAY, JUST A BUNCH OF TRASH THAT NEEDS TO BE PULLED OF THE MARKET UNTIL THEY CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S BETTER AND MOST OF ALL ACCURATE HEARING.A MOMMY THAT'S STILL KANGAROOING!!
not good: i bought this listener when i was about 22 weeks i am not 25 weeks and still have not heard a thing. all i heard was cars going by,the click of the button in my ear when i press it (ouch!!!) and my dog snoring, the fridge running and any other background noise. i wish i never spent the money on it. if i could afford it i would by one of the dopler listeners like my doctor has. dont buy this product.
EXTREMELY disappointed: The monitor has been sitting on my nightstand for some time as I had never been able to hear much aside from outside noises (television, washing machine, neighbors talking, etc.) or static from my own movement (breathing, an unsteady finger, growling stomach, you name it). I am now 38 weeks and decided to give it another try today. I heard a very faint heartbeat. I thought I could FINALLY record something via computer as suggested by the product to send a file to baby's grandparents in California. Even worse than hearing the static through the headphones is hearing the TREMENDOUS static and background noise after replaying the .wav on the computer. It even overshadowed the heartbeat which was inaudible on the playback. I am so extremely disappointed that I am considering writing a letter to Bebe Sounds about this bogus product. Please heed the warnings and save yourself the frustration of buying this "monitor."
Piece of Garbage: Don't bother with buying this. I've had this since 21 weeks and i am now almost 35. Every so often you can hear the baby kick, but no heartbeat. It's good if you want to hear your stomach rumble up close and personal.
Don't waste your time...: I'd have to agree with other 0 reviews I've read. This product is poorly developed. The entire handheld device is extremely sensitive to every movement, noise, creak, etc., that you or anyone near you could make. I even heard my husband snoring thru closed doors in the headset when I was trying to get it to work one night. Besides all my other internal noises, I can say I could hear the kicks when my baby moved, but that's not enough to persuade me to keep the monitor. It's going back to the store tomorrow. If you want to spy on someone's conversation down the street, this product is for you... Otherwise, you probably won't have much luck hearing your baby's heartbeat over all the other noise. I wonder if the folks who rated this product with 4-5 stars actually knew what they were hearing...
not worth it!: I bought this product with high hopes to hear the baby, and it doesnt work. the reasson i gave it 2 starts was because, my family and i reversed it (by talking in the microphone and putting the head phones on my belly) and talked to the baby, which it started to kick! but that was the only good thing it did (was let the baby hear the rest of the faimly)!
Total Waste of Money!: Please I urge you not to buy this product. We have tried every way to use this and I can barely even hear my own heartbeat with this product. Just save your money and enjoy listening to the heartbeat at the OBGYN. I just saved you 20 bucks!
Use a stethoscope instead!!!: In spite of what the reviews say and the warnings of other mothers, I bought this machine and have heard nothing but static. You have to hold the button steady to listen and all you hear is your finger trying to hold the button. The only good thing about this product is I can play music and talk to the baby. My daughter actually responded to the music and my singing. I can hear the baby better with a plain stethoscope. That's how I heard her heartbeat. BTW, I paid less than $10 for my stethoscope!!!
Useless: Waste of $$$.Can't hear anything except the noise being generated by holding down the button...
Does not work and causes baby to kick: My placenta is in the front so it has been very difficult to feel the baby move. However, when I used this product the baby actually kicked a few times which caused me to wonder if it was from irritation from the product since I never feel him move. The only heartbeat I have been able to find has been my own. I an 5 and 1/2 months have had no luck so far with this product.
Not worth 40 dollars: I bought this for myself when I was 4 months pregnant. I knew I wouldn't be able to hear any sounds right away, but I figured it would be worth the buy a few months down the road. I am now 8 1/2 months pregnant and have yet to hear the baby's heartbeat. (I've been listening for it from 18 wks on). I read the directions from cover to cover and even used it when his back was against my stomach (the best place they said to listen), but heard nothing. As for his kicks and hiccups, they are fairly easy to listen to as long as you lay still. The only part worth buying in the package is the microphone to play music to and read to him because he responds, but I'm sure regular headphones over your tummy work just as good. Overall, I was not too impressed and would not recommend this product for the price.
AWFUL SCAM: I hate this. I'm 29 weeks pregnant and still can't hear anything but my stomach growling. It picks up every noise within ten miles BUT my little boy's heart beat. Please don't waste your money on this. Just want you to have fair warning! :) Stetescopes work better. I have a fisher price stetescope and it works 10 x's better than this machine. I kid you NOT! So those of you that have them (the ones that are yellow with the red head) try it out! Hope this helps!
COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!: I bought this product it was the worst investment I have ever made! I could not hear my babies heart beat what so ever with this even up to my 35th week of pregnancy. It was pretty frustrating and scary at times not being able to hear a thing especially being a first time mommy. I would not waste a cent on this product!
Terrible Waste of Money: If there was any way I could give this product NO stars I would. I am 35 weeks pregnant and have YET to hear anything other than noise from this gadget. In fact, those women who hear the baby "moving" and such, I challenge you to put the monitor on your husband's stomach...you will hear the exact same noises. All it is is YOUR OWN regular digestive sounds you are hearing.It's clumsy, frustrating and doesn't do what it promises. I was lured by being able to "hear the baby's heartbeat" and I feel like I was taken for a ride. It's not right to play on people's emotions and then provide them with a product that doesn't work.I am very dissappointed in this product and I hope I save you the frustration I felt in this product.Bottom line: save your money for something else.
Garbage: I'm sorry I wasted my money. I am almost 8 months and cannot distinguish any baby sounds. I bought this product after having had a miscarriage and was hoping to hear the reassuring sound of my baby's heartbeat.Can't hear it. This monitor is junk!
We Even Knew Where Baby's Heart Was: We had the priveledge of having 4 ultrasounds done and everytime we went home to hear the baby's heartbeat....nothing but static (this was even during the 35th week).
We were delighted...: I received the Prenatal Gift Set as a shower present. My husband and I really enjoy listening to our unborn baby. It took a couple of sessions with the device for us to know what to listen for, but once you identify your baby's sounds, it's so much fun. The CD's included in the set have been very relaxing to listen to and may help us have a smarter baby. This is a great product for first time parents like us.
does not work well: not impressed, does not work well, all you hear is static, or you hear your finger holding down the button but not the heart beat!!!!
PIECE OF JUNK!: This is definitely a waste of money. Neither my husband nor I have EVER been able to hear the baby's heartbeat with this worthless piece of plastic. I wish I had known about renting a doppler before we wasted our time and money on this. With my rented doppler, we can find our baby's heartbeat in no time and get the reassurance that we need. Please DO NOT buy this item; ours ended up in the garbage because Babies R Us would not let us return it.
What a Waste of Money!: My husband and I purchased the Bebe Sounds Prenatal Listener Deluxe Gift Set shortly after we found out we were having a baby. Following the directions, we didn't try to use the heart listener until we were well into the fifth month. At that time, we were unable to hear anything but the gurgling of my own stomach. We kept trying right on through to the end. Now, at 39 weeks and knowing precisely where the baby is resting, we are still unable to hear the baby's heartbeat with this device. My sister-in-law also bought the system and had similar difficulties. The only redeeming feature of this pack is the microphone with which you may read and speak to your baby, as well as play music, but this is something that can easily be achieved with a regular walkman or other such device, which most people already have. During this time when there are so many things to buy, save yourself the cash (and aggravation) and get something that you can really use!
Not even worthy of 1 star!: Complete waste of money! I couldn't get it to pick up the heartbeat, even at the end of my pregnancy! I ended up calling the company and sending it back to them for a refund (they do guarantee your satisfaction). Don't bother with it!
Don't waste your money!!: I bought this product despite my girlfriend telling me that she was unable to hear her baby's heartbeat with the Bebe Sounds even up to a few days before delivery. My husband and I have tried and tried, and then tried again to hear the heartbeat and it's just not going to happen with this monitor. We were excited to hear "swooshing" sounds, thinking this was the baby, but when I put the monitor up to say, my ARM or LEG, you get the SAME SOUNDS!!!! I'm very, very disappointed.
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: This product does not work. . . my husband is a doctor and I'm a nurse and we have been trying to use this prenatal listener since I was 20 weeks (now I'm 34) and we have never heard our baby's heartbeat on it. You can hear my heartbeat just fine - and I'm convinced that is how they get you - you think you're hearing your baby's heartbeat but it's probably your own (take your pulse while you listen). Don't waste your money on this product!
don't waste your money!: I was pregnant with twins and convinced my hubby that since these were my last babies and I was having complications that hearing the babies' heartbeats would be fun and reassuring. What a DISAPPOINTMENT! I heard nothing but static. No baby heartbeats at all (and I had TWO babies in my tummy!) My husband tried. I tried. Several times. Nothing. What a complete and utter waste of money!If you're serious about listening to your baby's heartbeat, get the Babycom Doppler Fetal Heartbeat monitor. My friend is pregnant and she used the Babycom and was able to hear her baby's heartbeat the first time she tried it.Don't waste your money on Bebesounds...
Please don't buy this!!: I bought this when I was 5 months pregnant and tried several times to find the heartbeat and was unable to. I even tried it on my friend who was 8 months and it didn't work. Maybe some people have had luck with this product but I certainly didn't. If you are really looking for something to give you peace of mind, I would recommend renting a doppler. They don't cost too much and it's a piece of medical equipment that will work everytime. That is what I did and I was able to get the reassurance I needed.
Embarrasingly bad: I can't believe they are still allowed to sell this item as marketed. I tried using it from 5 months up to the week I gave birth and never heard anything except food digesting. I tried, my husband tried, my mother tried. My tummy sounded the same as my dog's tummy! I could hear my own heart beat really well, though... I threw this item away--I am still mad that I spent money on this piece of trash.
Huge disappointment!!!: I am so very disappointed in this product. With my first pregnancy, I was not able to hear a heartbeat until my seventh month. I am on my second pregnancy and am 25 weeks along. So far, I have not heard a damn thing but the cars outside my apartment building, the tv in the living room and even the neighbor's stereo downstairs below me. I was very close to trashing it during my first pregnancy, but this time, I chunked that damn thing in the trash! Do not waste your money on this product. If it's priced below 100 bucks, then it's probably a piece of junk. Just go off of your baby's movement every day for re-assurance that all is well.
PIECE OF JUNK: I PURCHASED THIS A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, AND WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. I HEAR THE CARS PASSING BY MY HOUSE, AND IF MY HUSBAND IS DOWNSTAIRS IN THE FAMILY ROOM, I CAN HEAR THE T.V. CLEAR EVEN ON THE FIRST VOLUME NUMBER. BUT NO HEARTBEAT. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
What ever you do, don't buy this product: We share a similar story about this gift set. We were hesitant to buy this, but decided to give it a try. We have tried using it numerous amount of times and still have not been able to hear anything besides a noise that i can only descibe as an airplane over head. My girlfriend is 21 weeks and can feel the baby moving, but cant hear it. Please don't waste your money. It can be better used for other things.
Average Purchase: I bounght the monitor naturally to hear the HB. At 24 weeks I still just hear the sounds of her kicking inside me. Now those are precious, and for the counting that we need to do later in the pregnancy, that may come in handy. However, if you are buying this to hear the HB...I fear the other reviewers are correct...it is a waste of your money!
Piece of Junk!: I am pregnant with my first child, and I bought this because I thought that it would be great to be able to hear the babies heart whenever I wanted too. Well big mistake, because the only thing you can hear with this thing is the wooshing of your own stomach, and I have used this thing exactly like it says to in the manual! Not to mention the fact that I have only had it probably a week, and it has already stopped working! Over all I would not recommend purchasing this item!
Very Disappointed: My husband bought the heart listener as a gift for me so I could listen to the baby. I was already 7 months along. I have never heard ANYTHING with this product even at full term. I think it is a fine idea, it just doesn't work. My littman stethoscope works 100 times better. Save your money and skip this purchase.
Don't buy this!: I bought this product when pregnant with my first child, and tried it again when pregnant with my second child. I never heard a heartbeat! I suggest that no one waste money on this product, it only served to worry me. I am a small person, so it is not as though it had a lot of fat to go through, I tried it even toward the end of my pregnancies and never heard a heartbeat. Please don't waste your money.
Don't Buy! Just a Gimic for Parents: I'd give this a 0 stars but that is not an option. I am 28 days away from my due date and I have yet to hear the heartbeat via this device. My husband and I bought it and tried it. It didn't work. We'd turn it low and then high and still no heartbeat! The worst part is that it is considered a health and beauty product and can't be returned to the store. Don't take the risk... you'll regret it!
Not great...: SO far I am 24 weeks and I haven't heard a peep with this monitor and honestly I can barely hear my own heart beat when I hold it up to my left chest area. The only sounds I can hear are some minor whooshing sounds which could be anything.
Please listen to these reviews!: This product is such a waste of money. I paid 50 dollars and really regret it. The only heart beat I could find was my cats! This product plays on your feelings of wanting to hear your baby and "bond" with your baby. The only thing this product is is fustrating. The CD's are nice and the microphone that you can use to put on your tummy is okay, but there are cheaper CD's and I hardly think you need a microphone for the baby to hear the music. Good Luck and spend the money on baby clothes or a pregnancy massage!
An Absolute Disappointment: I received this monitor as a gift when I was 20 weeks along. I am 35 weeks pregnant and have NOT once heard my baby's heartbeat with this listener. My Husband and I have tried and tried, but all we can really hear is my belly's "swooshing" sounds. This monitor is an absolute disappointment, don't waist your money or time on it.....
Luck be a pregnant mom: After speaking with my doctor about this item, she laughed and told me "If you and your husband want to speak to the baby, just open your mouth. Never underestimate the power of nature." I still wanted to try this "wonder toy" for myself. I ventured over to my best friends house (also pregnant) and put this triangle object on my stomach. After blowing out an eardrum from the clicking sound and cord movment, I decided my doctor was right. The baby and I still have plenty of time in the near future to talk, listen and bond together. Until then.......I saved myself some money. Hope you do too.
Bonding: I liked this item, because it gives you and your husband or partner the chance to bond with you baby. My husband gets so involved now with the microphone and the headphones. It is so nice to see that. You have to listen really really hard to hear your baby's heartbeat, but that is not the only feature of this item. I have been able to hear our baby moving around a lot and it is really great. I recommend this item!!!!
A piece of junk!: I bought this because I wanted to be able to hear my baby in between pre natal visits. Well even after following the directions EXACTLY I could never hear anything but my own stomach. Also the classical CD that comes with this set is junk! It skips and sometimes won't play at all. It's not worth the money or the time you have to put into this.
Save your money for something that works!: The heart monitor doesn't work at all. All you get is outside noise.
Piss Poor Product!: Even after reading the bad reviews, I decided to give this product the benefit of the doubt. I was completely disappointed!!! Especially since I was so excited at the thought of being to hear my babies heart beat on a regular basis as oppose to having to wait until the monthly doctor's visits. I agree, save yourself the cash!!
heard everything EXCEPT baby: I borrowed this product from a friend who told me it didn't work. I was slim and 22 weeks pregnant, so I thought I should be able to hear something. Turns out the microphone is so sensitive, all other noises beat out any noise from baby! I heard my finger joints move, the air conditioner turn on, and since you have to hold the button down the entire time, any hand movement is detected and hurts your ears! Perhaps if I waited until 30+ weeks, I might have had better luck, but as an anxious Mommy, this product didn't deliver.
Junk: Just to reiterate, this product is junk. we live in a quiet area so no car sounds, and we turn off the television. I am 28 weeks and nothing. I thought maybe I heard a faint sound, but it's nothing like my doctor's doplar sono that she uses to listen to the heartbeat and is pretty much worthless. The only thing I can hear is the sound of my own body. I strongly advise against purchasing this product.
Very Disappointed: I bought this device when I was approximately 3 months along. I had no idea that it would not be of any use until around 4 or 5 months. This in itself lead to some disappointment when I brought it home. I have since (now 6 months pregnant) tried it 10 or so times all with no luck. I have not heard a single thing even coming close to a heartbeat and my child is very very active so I know it is there!! I would not recommend this product to anyone especially if you get let down very easily.
Save your money: I was so excited about this product and everything it promised that I bought it as soon as I could. Of course no where on the outside of the box does it tell you that you should be at least 5 months pregnant to hear the heartbeat (they do mention it in the instruction booklet once you've opened everything). So I had to wait about 4 weeks. I am now 8 months pregnant and have yet to hear the heartbeat no matter where I position the monitor or how still I lie. I can only pick up stomach noises and my own heartbeat. It's very disappointing. As for the music aspect- the baby doesn't require the microphone to hear so I'm returning this product and using my regular stereo to play music to him- [money] is too much for something I can do for free and the money can better be spent on something that works.
What a bummer: At first I thought it was neat what I was hearing. The gurgling sounds and kicks, until I put it on my husband and heard the same thing. I'm almost positive he does not have a baby in his belly. Very dissapointed.
Way too expensive: I bought this product and it is sitting on my dining room table. First of all when you read the booklet it tells you that you should be 5 months pregnant or more. I am 4 months pregnant and I cannot hear a thing and I don't think that I will ever hear anything. My advice is wait for your prenatal appointments. This product is way too expensive and it is a waste of good money.
zero stars (if that was an option): This product does not work. I was glad that I wasn't the only one not hearing my baby's heartbeat. Pretty much everybody that I have spoken to who has encountered this piece of junk agrees that it doesn't work. Those that have heard the heartbeat are lucky. Bebe Sounds should be ashamed for marketing something that does not live up to its expectations.
QUITE DISAPPOINTED!!: I bought this product at 5 months of pregnancy expecting to hear my baby's heartbeat. I am now in my 7th month and still cannot hear anything except the thump of when my baby pushes on the monitor (which is kind of cute). I am quite disappointed cuz I read all the directions and followed them to the T and I try listening every few days in an absolutely quiet room and nothing is heard by myself or my husband. I can hear my heartbeat when I test it - but not the baby's.Its disappointing cuz I looked forward to hearing his heartbeat in between my prenatal visits - but now I go every 2 weeks, so at least its not a long wait anymore! Wish I could return the product!! I don't recommend this to anyone to purchase - first try it in the stores (if you can) to see if you get anything out of it. Wish I had the luck the other good reviewers had!
Don't Get Too Excited: I had purchased this monitor for my husband who insisted on having one. I was so excited to give it to him but the excitement didnt last long. Maybe if you are experienced and know what your listening to it could be enjoyable. But all you hear are your own stomach noises. I was tempted to bring it to one of my doctors appointments so he could shed some light onto what I was listening to but I was too embarrassed.
Worst MOVIE I've ever seen: This is definately the worst movie ever. I can't believe I watched the whole thing. It keeps getting worse and worse as it goes on. The plot goes from OK at the beginning, to down right horrible at the end. The soundtrack has got to be one of the worst ever also. Don't waste your time on this movie.
An old plot: While it's true that it goes downhill after the beginning. The movie goes away from the basketball player Jackie Stewart and focuses more on the coach. The coach is so desperate to protect Jakcie that his own family sufferes with his wife getting raped and his son holding the bloody remains of the family dog.I would probably say that this movie sounds more like something that would be a Law & Order plot.
Waste of time, film, and Drago: This thing was just dreck. Mindless. The only thing worse than the plot and most of the acting was Billy Drago's haircut. Billy, I love you, but, put down the Flowbee.The only good parts were the scenes between Drago and Richard Lynch--two old pros who know their way around thin plots and amateurish film making. If you're a fan of either man...well, I'm sorry, there's not much to recommend here. They do what they can with what they have. Otherwise, stay far away.
Educational DVD with limited educational value: Sound and picture quality has that quaint homespun quality. Offers dozens of questions but does not begin to answer most of them. Captions contain at least three spelling mistakes. Drifts off on strange tangents e.g. modern flags of southern states. Leaves crucial areas untouched - e.g. failure of Confederate foreign policy.
Description is wrong or packaging is wrong..which is it??: I purchased this item for my Toyota Tundra only to discover that when it arrived there is only ONE set in box for the front. The carton says TWO. So, I thought thatperhaps the carton came open in transit and one was lost. I contacted Amazon C/s, who was great, they sent another carton. It arrived today and again, there is onlyONE set even though the carton says TWO. My conclusion is that the description is incorrect and the carton,although marked two means that 2=1 set for the front only. I have returned both cartons as the price is way too high for a single set. Beware if you order this, as it is not what it seems.
Only a bigoted person could find this book he;pful: I have read this book and bucailles book, i am neither muslim nor christian as such but have to say that Bucailless book is considerably more convincing. This seems like a week attempt to divert attention from Bucailles book.
A Devastating Refutation of Bucaille's Book: Dr. William Campbell's book is a fantastic refutation of the claim that the Quran is a scientific miracle and an excellent defense of the accuracy and inspiration of the Holy Bible. I highly recommend it.Just one comment to those who claimed that Naik defeated Campbell. It is true that Campbell did a vey poor job, but that is because his skill is in writing not debating. Far from refuting Campbell, Naik managed to tap dance his way around many of the arguments and give the misleading impression that he actually addressed the issues...
great book, responds to Bucaille's thoroughly.: ..Answers the wildly arrogant claims to "objectivity" made by Bucaille in his now DATED "authorative" book that "proves" Islam correct. the number of contradictions of physics, common sense and reason that abound in the Koran are answered in all manner of pages on the net. But that a christian author had the stuffing to take on one of the primary "evangelical" books used by muslims is commendable. Too bad he doesn't turn the same baloney detector on the christian claims..does a good job of shoring up the claims for pre-christian Biblical faith, though..
If you believe Dr Campell, then read this: Anyone who believes this book should buy the video debate between Dr Campell & DR Niak, which shows all the errors in the book. You can find it at islamicbookstore.com. search for Dr Campell & youll find the video of the debate they held in Chicago. See for yourself how poorly his book stands up to true facts & agreed upon translations. Its sad that people are motivated by hate to write such books.
weak attempt to discredit Bucaille: the book is a sorry attempt to disprove Maurice Bucaille's book the Bible, the Quran, & Science. other people that agree with Dr Campell ( who claim to have read Bucaille's book) seem to overlook a great detail about Bucaille. He was not a muslim when he set out to write his book. he specifically learned arabic to study the Quran. The facts given in his book are thorough & percise. Dr campell's attempt to disprove him is cleary just an angry response which has blinded him for being truly objective. His examples are weak & sorry. I urge people to read Bucaille's book & see for themselves. Anyone who supports Dr Campell & thinks Muslims are trying to attack the christian faith are mistaken. People should not forget that muslims beleive in Jesus & his miracles. If your looking to buy a book that compares the Quran & the Bible ,i suggest you look elsewhere.
Ignorance: I believe that Bucaille's book was a revolution in dealing with the holy books.it was very logic,giving proofs for what he is talking about.But the truth is often sour,so that some people don't listen to it,or just make a lot of noise.Campbell's book was some of this noise.
Falsehood by its very nature will perish sooner or later: This is a below standard book written by somebody whose heart is full of deception and lies. This book does not even deserve 1 star. Poor Dr. Campbell challenged every Muslims in the world to refute his claims in the book. Dr. Zakir Naik took that challenge and in an completely one-sided debate defeated Dr. Campbell soundly. In terms of Basketball scoring it would be 100-0 in favor of Dr. Naik. The people who gave him high ratings (just because it is anti-Islamic) should have the guts to watch that debate. It is available at islamicbookstore.com and follow the video links at the left and go to Debates and speeches of Dr. Zakir Naik. Falsehood by its very nature will perish sooner or later. Amen.
hose too short: I guess I assumed that portable AC units would be portable beyond 6 feet from the window. Clearly these products are designed for situations where a window unit cannot be employed because of the window and the weight it can support.The exhaust hose is literally 8 ft long and does not allow you to place the unit between two rooms or move it around the house as needed (because you would need to connect it to a different window) - which is what I thought they were.Buyer beware...if you intended to use it as it is designed, works fine. The unit is a little large, but it does pump out a lot of cool air.
Cool Cooler: This unit is easy to use and easy to move around. It provides plenty of cold air. I would recommend this product to anyone that needs a portable air conditioner.
Not recomended: This item is not worth it. It takes hours to cool down my 100 sq ft room. I have a 5,000 btu window unit that kicks butt compared to this one. Also, not convenient at all. You need to place a drip pan underneath to catch the water and it only allows a 1" space at the base. I had to build a 4" platform to lift the unit high enough to sit a basin at the bottom to catch all the drip without having to empty it every 1 1/2 hours.
IMpossible to maintain: this air conditioner has one filter which is easily removed for cleaning purposes, but the intake filter is completely hidden and cleaning it entails disassembling the unit, removing the case, just to access the filters. What a nightmare.
Works Great...BUT....: This unit was easy to install and easy to use. It works great...cooling down the room quickly. The only problem is that is it very loud.
Bad move: This unit is awful. I have a TINY studio apartment and it is never cool enough. Now it started shutting down sometimes and won't restart. This is my second summer with it. Very loud also.
A Disorganized and Confusing Textbook.: Explanations of concepts are constantly interrupted mid-paragraph by various secondary explanations, questions and diagrams that do not tie in well with the central concept that was being explained. I find it very difficult to follow when each page is scattered with little side projects for the student to try with the cd-rom or with a calculator. Just glancing at any page it is hard to find the heart of the material. I much prefer a text that focuses on straight forward explanations of concepts rather than what seems to me as mere gimmicks.
Solid hitter: Baseball fans should find this book most entertaining - great reading during a rain delay. Luciano was an American League umpire, famous for his way of "gunning" out batters on the base paths and his legendary on-field arguments with Earl Weaver. This book, his second, and much like the first, recounts humorous stories while umpiring from the minor leagues up through the majors. Great stories: the baseball diamond can be a pretty wacky place sometimes.
Boring: This book was needed for a class and it is an incredibly boring read. It is really hard to follow the point.
Amy Grant Music: I bought this CD for my brother's Birthday. It was a much loved addition to his new Amy Grant collection.
i like this album: This is the type of album that leaves me singing the tunes after I finished listening to it.
soulfull & inspiring: Over the years Amy Grant has been one of the most inspirational artists around. I love this album its a great collection of all her previous works, and best part is that it all sounds 100 times better than when they first came out. I heard her new album "Legacy..hymns & faith" off her official site, and if your in search of something trully inspirational I would suggest you get it...its really great!
inspirational songs: I've been an amy grant fan for 20 years, however certainly wouldn't recommend buying this cd. It's just poor songs from her early career, her long existing "The Collection" is great, this doesn't even compare. I feel abused as a fan that I was suckered into buying it.
The best yet: I highly recommend this CD for anyone interested in quality Christian music, especially those individuals who miss the quality sounds of the 1980's. This CD does include her later hits, which showcase her maturity, but some of Amy Grant's best earliest work is also included. These earlier songs show an innocence that is not often heard anymore, but this does not outdate these songs. The Christian messages they include are timeless. In such songs as "In a Little While" and "Old Man's Rubble", timeless Christian messages are presented in new and innovative ways. Her later songs, including the masterpiece "Sing your Praises to the Lord" and "Thy Word" show her talent increasing with the years.This CD is not only for Amy Grant fans, but for anyone wishing to add quality and variety to their Christian music collection.
Tired re-release: No life, no spark, nothing new- not even arrangements. Not needed unless you don't have the albums these came from.
A shining picture book!: For anyone who loves dogs, the sun-washed Maine coast, and bright joyful images that gladden the spirit, this is the book for you! As a librarian, I know that true picture books, ones without words, whose images carry the story, are amongst the very best for fueling the imagination of pre-schoolers. In my library we have a permanent display of these books and they simply fly out of the door in the arms of patrons of all ages. Rebecca Goodale's book is one of the very best. Her strong playful images and surprising page structures will get the attention of the most disinterested reader. Highly recommended for any home or library collection.
A little bit too technical for an intro: After reading the reviews on this page, I was excited to read a book that would provide a "layman" like myself an easy introduction to the workings and ways of the brain. But I was disappointed with what I read. The first two chapters were great, and truly were introductory and easy to read: the first was a basic introduction to the brain, and the second provided reviewed the history of brain research through the ages. Starting with Chapter 3, however, the book became overally technical and difficult to read. The Chapter on memory was interesting, and overall I did learn things, but as a "layman", I found myself very confused and overwhelmed as I struggled to make it through what I found to be a very 'Non-Introductory' introduction.
Excellent read if you are very curious and very patient.: The topic in certainly not for the casual reader.The first part is clear and full of interesting revelations.The second part is a little too technical for the layman, but rewarding if you stick to it.At the beginning of the book I would have liked a clear description of the parts of a human brain with 3D pictures and 2D sections.Otherwise, a good book.
Awesome value: I have owned my Kingmax 1 GB flash drive for over six months now, and I still love it. Reading some other people's reviews, it seems that lack of durability is an issue for some. I keep mine in my wallet, where it won't get hurt; I figure that my wallet will always be on or close to me, and if it's not...well, then I have more important things to worry about than a missing flash drive. I have experienced no technical issues with it. It does get a little warm during use, but I figured that was normal. One refreshing difference I noticed between my Kingmax flash drive and my Memorex and Sony ones is that the Kingmax did not come preloaded with lots of annoying software.All in all, well worth the purchase price and then some. Highly recommend.
Great But I Lost It!: I liked it but after attempting to use the little key chain thing it broke and fell off and I lost it.
Fragile!: If you buy this, don't put it on a keychain, or carry it in your pocket. I bought mine two weeks ago and yesterday it snapped in half (without any abuse on my part.) Nice and cheap, but you get what you pay for.
So Great: Straps on the Key chain, and goes. I have had one before, and just purchased a second one. At this price, buy 10 and give them to a your friends. They are so small and cool, anybody would love to have them.
Tiny is an understatement!: I just received the Super Stick today, and it works wonderfully. It is an excellent deal for a 1GB flash drive this smalls (I paid only $16)! Sony's new MicroVault goes for $30+.The write speed is somewhat lagging, but I'm a patient dude, so all is well there. The one other thing I noticed was that it gets hot and quick. This could either be just do to it basically being just the memory stick itself, or it could have something to do with my laptop. Either way, it's no big deal.Definitely recommend!
Small, water resistant and handy to have...: Small, water resistant and handy to have on your key chain. The write speed is a little slow but other than that I'm pleased.
love it: what can i say? its a tiny usb drive! its almost perfect, but i had to find a lanyard thing to attach it to so i wouldn't lose it. would have been nice to have included one instead of that useless two-inch keychain attachment. but its awesome and you can't beat that price!
Ripped off with shipping charge: $1.75 a piece? I'll take 4. They are the size of a paperclip. Great! BUT; $24.95 for "shipping and handling"???? I'VE BEEN RIPPED OFF BY 1 CLICK SHIPPING. I WON'T BUY FROM THESE JOKERS AGAIN.
Small is Good: I love how small this little jumpdrive is. I got it from Amazon way back in the day. At 4 years old, it's still going strong. I actually bought myself another one too. I just leave it in my pack for whenever I need it. It fits in the usb slot where other jumpdrives just won't fit.
Awesome jazz: This is great creative jazz. I have listened to this album for years and it is so outstanding that it beats most of the stuff out there now (except for Herbie Hancock or Ramsey Lewis who are the greatest).
layered listen: I'm not a musician but I think the comparisons to McCann's electric piano style and that of Stevie Wonder in the mid-70s are quite accurate. Some of these tunes do invoke a similar mood and style. These compositions don't jump out at you, but seep into your brain and grow and grow until they become familiar. Layers indeed! I love albums like this that fuse jazz and soul, creating a heady musical stew. Sometimes they are successful and sometimes a bit bland, but this album by Les McCann was one of the success stories.
was on my wish list, bought it in a Virgin Megastore: It's great music with great artists. Notable tracks that I didn't have on CD yet were 'cafe de flore by dr. rockit', 'all that you give by the cinematic orchestra'And notable artists: chet baker, st germain, i:cube, stephane pompougnac, chateau flight (notable song not on this cd is "camping jazz" of which I know the name), gotan project, the herbaliser, slow train, mr scruff, mark rae (from Rae & Christian), Aim, jazzanova, de-phazz, beanfield, infracom, truby trio, marschmellows, boozoo bajou, mo horizons, alphawezen, thievery corporation.These are the names that I know best, and to see that many on one compilation is a blessing.
not a mix...: If you're expecting a mix type cd - this is not. Individual songs - stop and go/close and play (remember making those type of cassettes in the 70s)- make this a disappointing cd. The Berlin and NYC cds are okay - the London cd is passable - the Paris cd is bad.
oh my: this is the first babes in toyland cd i got.i listened to this and the first song i heard was dust cake boy,screams at me til' i'm deaf.great cd,katastrophy wife is a good improvement for kat but i miss lori. :(
PROOF THAT DIFFERENT ISN'T ALWAYS GOOD: Cee-lo was cool in the Goodie MoB with his righteous soulful growl but he can't hold his own with his own album.This album is overexperimental,overproduced,and corny.Cee-lo tries to be some big,electic,righteous musical voice BUT he's NOT.In fact,he sounds downright goofy.And this albums' singles single:"Closet Freak" and "Gettin' Grown" sound like comedy records.And what's up with the cheesy,oddball videos?Man,oh,man,it's a sad day when even mainstream rap artists try to be innovative but still come out shortchanged.
money well spent: Cee-Lo is a poet, pure and simple. I don't know how to describe this CD. All I know is that I can't stop listening to it. The songs are so new and fresh, yet basic and funky, I have to keep listening. I find myself having a conversation with the music...saying uh-huh, yeah, I see where you're coming from, bro. Cee-Lo knows how to get his message out and let you see things in him that you know you've been afraid to admit you've been struggling with, too. This is true hip-hop--innovative and bold. The CD is out there, but if you have an open, curious mind, it'll hit you deep down in there somewhere. Favorite tracks: microhard (just flows), bass head jazz (speaks for itself), under that influence (funky), country love (if you a country boy or girl, no explanations needed), medieval times (very poetic), young man (simple beautiful...pianos, cee-lo rhyming, message, soul, poetry). Good stuff!
NO CD NO REFUND NOT HAPPY!!!!: I haven't received this CD cant believe you want me to review it....Get my money back and tell the seller I said I understand why your reviews are horrible.
odd: This here album is like that 3d chips commercials, you know, that one with those two fat black guys rapping in a wierd squeaky voice.
Breath of Fresh Air: Man when I got this album I couldn't take it out of the car for a month. The funk, the hip hop, soul and jazz intertwined on this album makes for great listening. Although, some people can't get into his voice I for one dig it. Something different in the sea of same ol same ol. Diggin it.....too bad that Goodie Mobb is now done....
If you like Prince, then you'll love Cee-Lo...: As I listened to Cee-Lo's CD I couldn't help thinking about the music of Prince. Both artists use funky beats and thought-provoking lyrics to make the listener surrender to their grooves.My favorite tracks were "Closet Freak" and "Medieval Times." The entire CD is good to listen to. I didn't hear any tracks that were dull or seemed to be only filler.Get this CD. It is definitely one of the best ones of 2002.
best of 2002: this c.d. blew me away. i can not stop listening! most beautiful...i would say more but words can not describe my enjoyment for his creative expression!!!!
Let him take you on a fonkey ride! All around the world!: Cee Lo wrote and produced all the songs on this wonderful album. I categorize it with Digable Planets and Outkast's debut as albums that will change the sonic menu for hiphop records. After this album, more so called rappers will be singing like they Donny Hathaway but I doubt if they have the worldly wisdom and the courage to fly that Cee Lo has. This is one of the years best, definitely bump this joint in your bucket. The sure shot hits are Closet Freak, One for the Road and Follow Me.
Perfectly Imperfect!: Cee-lo and the Goodie-Mob, hav put out some of the most memorable tracks in recent history. Now doing his solo thing, Mr.Green get the chance to show the world exactly what it is he an do. The CD blends Hip-Hip, R&B, Soul, Cypher, Rap, and Gospel together to, produce a very cohesive album. Always kicking knowlege, expect to get some food for thought, and a something to bop your head to. Pick It Up!Peace & Blessings
get it: go get it...worth buying.....also take a look at Southern Slang by D.O.W.N. this is some tight [stuff],.,.....these [people] about ta blow...bangin' beats...rhymes off tha chain.
Inspirational: This is an inspirational story very well told. You will learn a lot about organ donation, Cystic Fibrosis and they way other governments and cultures treat those in need of organ transplants. Save lives, be an organ donor! Sign up is easy, go to [...]
POWER-FILLED MOVIE!: My daughter is in the end stage of the terrible disease of cystic fibrosis. She saw THE POWER OF TWO at a special showing and reception attended by one of the twins. Their story gave her and our son-in-law much reason for optimism in her own case, while also providing much useful and inspiring information. It's an excellent documentary and has helped me to better understand what my daughter will be experiencing upon being accepted as a double-lung transplant recipient.
Profoundly Moving Documentary: The Power of Two is an amazing movie about the triumphant journey of Ana and Isa Stenzel, who have documented their journey through the difficult medical maze of life with cystic fibrosis and lung transplants and generously dedicated their lives to raising organ donation awareness in both the U.S. and Japan. The two most difficult moments in the movie (the realization of lack of medical care for CF patients in Japan and Isa's husband's anguish when she nearly dies before she is rescued by a life-saving lung transplant)are intense and heart-rending. Bravo to all involved in the making of this documentary.
Fascinating reading: Irving Stone was one heck of a writer and it's a shame that his books are so hard to find now. They Also Ran tells the stories of the men who ran for president and lost. It talks about who these men were, what shaped them and what they did once the campaign was done. It really makes you wonder (or shiver) at what might have been.
Amazing book--you must track down and read: Someone gave this book to Bob Dole after '96; I hope Al Gore gets a chance to read it, too. What I took from the book is that on many occasions, America dodged a bullet by not being governed by a clearly unqualified loser. In other cases, we should consider ourselves unfortunate that the loser wasn't the winner.Originally written in the 1940's by the late Irving Stone, the book is woefully in need of an update by a prominent historian who can add Dewey, Stevenson, Goldwater, Humphrey, McGovern, Mondale, Dukakis, Dole and Gore. And I agree with the previous reviewer: the inside of the dust jacket is fascinating--if you can find one of these rare hard cover copies.
An old favorite: I ran across this book on my grandfather's bookshelf as a teenager in the early '70's and have returned to it many times since. The format of short essays on each race made it quite readable while conveying a useful series of sketches of the procession of issues and political trends across the first 160 years of U.S. Government under the Constitution. I'm trying to convince my son to read it to fulfill his non-fiction summer reading assignment and checked here to see whether it was still in print. Sorry to see it is not.
Not worth .01!: Nothing works, the program crashes the computer, contacted manufacturer several times, no response!Save your money!
Log Rolling in Our Times: Look at the reviews on the book's jacket... "instant classic", "must read", etc. It looks like the trading seminar circuit got together to laud a book for what is essentially freely available information. As is typical with the Wiley books lately, it's got typos, and the material is fluffed up when it could probably fit on 50 pages of a regular textbook. Even the SuperSOES information is publicly available at the Nasdaq Trader Web site. This book is so typical of the spate of throwaway trading books that have been written the past several years.
Underperformer: Don't buy this book for the following reasons: a) contents contains no new insights whatsoever compared to other books, information available on the internet b) the style is irritant. Author keeps referring the topics that will be discussed further on. A complete waste of money.
only book dedicated to execution: This is the hardcopy version of the excellent e-book the "Tools of the Trade." Everything you need to know about execution. Including SuperSoes, SelectNet, Soes, all ECN's. It is the best reference manual I've ever seen. Don't know why they decided to publish in paper.,. Author is former market maker, used to head MB Tradings' trade desk. You can see him at all the trade expos -gives talks about execution. Knows his stuff. Wish I had the book when I started trading direct! Would have saved some of lo$$e$ :)
One of her best: This is my favorite Garbo film. I love everything about it-the story, the direction,the performances, the costumes. This film sums up what Garbo meant to women of her time. It's a must-see for anyone interested in her career.
Garbo: I've waited years to see this film and enjoyed immensely. Good Plot as well. Garbo fans should not miss.
The Single Standard--A Neglected Classic: It's a fair question: What's the big deal about Greta Garbo?If you watch The Single Standard, you'll start to find out....Her acting is outstanding, and the theme is timeless....
You have got to be kidding: I know little of Judaism and therefore must rely on the expertise of the writers to evaluate the book's worth. On that basis, the quality of the book must be uneven.Mezvinsky was trained as a historian but his publication list is poor indeed. Most of his writing seems to be for popular magazines like the "Washington Report on Middle East Affairs." He has very few publications of a truly scholarly nature and many of those were collections of other people's work that he had edited. I have read a fair number of books written by scholars of the Middle East and can't remember a single one ever citing Mezvinsky's work.There is nothing in Mezvinsky's list of publications that even remotely suggests that he has any expertise on Judaism as a religion.Incidentally, years ago, Moshe Menuhin wrote a book entitled Jewish Critics of Zionism. In his book, he described Mezvinsky as a "clever but arrogant and presumptuous fellow."
If you like Fabrication and Political Anti-Semitism: then please buy this book! This is clearly a book written by someone who has never stepped foot out of his comfortable city life and engaged with a real religious Jew. This could have been written by anyone who reads left-wing media - a waste of your time.
misinformation: The book, co-authored Shahak is grounded in the assumption that Judaism is inherently bad. Shahak, a chemistry professor was better known for his condemnation of Israel and Jews. Among Shahak's many tidbits of misinformation are false allegations that Jews don't use "+" symbols in arithmetic because they are "crosses," and the false allegation that observant Jews ritually defile Christian cemeteries. They also provide misinformation on the Talmud and Kabbalah. Although one can find excellent English translations in context of Talmud and much of the Kabbalah and even online information, most people may well rely on a published book like this. Those that do will be grossly misinformed.
detail on jewish fundamentalism: I enjoyed this book. There is a tremendous amount of detail on the different Jewish fundamentalist political groups, the major one being Shas. Certain areas of the book interested me more than others. I felt the points on religiosity and fundamentalism were interesting. Another major point of my interest was the work on Baruch Goldstein. Shahak and Mezvinsky did an excellent job in substantiating that Baruch Goldstein was part of a larger Jewish fundamentalist movement that is accepted by Israel rather than a single crazy man.
Not good for bettas...: This cup is too small for a betta to live in. Bettas (contrary to popular opinion) need more space than a small cup. Also, bettas are accomplished jumpers and will jump right out. I advise getting a tank of at least 2 gallons with a lid if you plan on keeping a betta. (My bettas go in no less than 5 gallons.)
Bulky: This wig is far too bulky. I am on the petite side, but I really drowned under it. Since it's already in a ponytail, you can't really "fix/adjust" it, and have it look halfway decent. I wouldn't recommend this, unless of course you have a gigantic head, and really want a thick head of hair. Since I had to give it a star, I choose to use my one star for the price of the product.....
No drainage holes!: No drainage holes--a MUST for bonsai pots. We are having to drill them ourselves, and this material is like iron! Do not recommend them.
The COOLEST "frACTAL" cyber-art-music-chaos-tripout!!: This video is over an HOUR LONG, all ORIGINAL content (no loops), no animation, no "lecture", just hot trippy music and some WAY COOL fractals. These were actually generated from the real deal, and the Images of Chaos just keep kickin'. Images are sharp and crisp. Cool for "intense" viewing or daydreaming. Heard about it on the "chaos metalink" and been getting off on it ever since. Ah...it's a TRIP!
Interesting if you can see the book around his big head.: The Defense Never Rests is an interesting view into the career of one of the most famous lawyers in the United States. From O.J. Simpson to Sam Sheppard (sp?), F. Lee Bailey has been at the forefront of many famous and infamous trials.Unfortunately what would have been a nice snapshot and insight into a legal career, the book is marred by Bailey's ego. In the cases that he won, he says it was a triumph of justice. Those he lost were when the legal system failed. Hmm...You often get the impression when reading through the cases in the book that he writes what he wishes he would have said in those situations. I find it hard to believe that someone can make every comment or quotation perfect as he says throughout the book.I would recommend this book to anyone who has a particular interest in law, but only someone with a strong stomach. Some of Bailey's cases are genuinely interesting, but many are just self-inflated ego trips.
Bailey at his best: The real Lee Bailey at the start of a magnificent career before the booze got to him. Epitomised the true creed of the winning advocate i.e. preparation preparation preparation.
Problems with this product: I have a three car garage with a total of 750 sq feet. I scrubbed the floor and rinsed it well before using the etch. The garage is humidity controlled and was at 78 degrees while working on it. I followed directions to a tee. Each kit had a different consistency. The end result was a garage with three different shades of tan. Very noticeable. The product takes much longer to dry then the instructions state. It has been curing for a month now and today I moved a tool box with wheels over it and it left marks. Would hate to think what parking my car on it would do. I will have to see how this ends up after a few more months and will report at that time. Do to the different consistencies of the kits and the different shades of each kit I would guess Rust-Oleum has a serious quality control issue. I would not recommendthis product.
Very disappointing: I had already painted my 2-car garage floor twice in 10 years...the car tires always led the way for peeling throughout the floor....so I followed the prep directions for this product to the letter, scraping off old paint for days and even kept the cars off for the new surface for a full week....well it took only 2 DAYS for the car tires to start pulling up the surface. With the prior two paint jobs, it took several weeks for the paint to peel...I feel I should be compensated for the all the time I put in.....
Bad Experience: I had a similar experience to the previous reviewer. The epoxy is different tones throughout the garage, creating a checker board effect. The roller marks are also quite visible. I called rustoleum customer support and they said that the packaging indicates that the color might not be uniform. Not very helpful. Also, like the previous reviewer, I had barely enough material to cover the garage. I had to spread the material so thin that I doubt it will provide any long term protection.This is the second review that I have attempted to post, Amazon saw fit to not post the first review. I trust that Amazon is not cooperating with corporations at the expense of their customers!!! Lets see if this review makes it!!!
Great for 5 days, then disaster: All was great for five days, then disaster. Floor became sticky and began peeling immediately. Forget putting a car on it, bare feet peeled it up. I can only speculate that good reviews shown here are from Rustoleum reps.
Misleading Product Information: I purchased a new home about 1 year ago and decided to place an epoxy on the garage floor. The floor had very small oil stains and was in great shape. I followed the directions as provided on the CD and also within the written instructions. It took me about 2 days worth of scrubbing, cleaning the surface to ensure the best possible finish. I also carefully followed the directions related to the mixing and time frame in which to apply the epoxy on the surface.The result was that almost every section (applied 4 x 4 foot sections) had a different color to it. No stains (from the previous oil) was evident. It is unclear why this is the case but other individuals have had the same issues with this product. The instructions did not mention this possible problem nor explain how to avoid it. For this purpose I would recommend another product or have it done professionally.
Great: Very happy with the way they feel on my feet, there is some foot support and they look good on me aswell, I will continue to buy more vans in the future
Confusing: I had no problem with the quality of the shoe, my complaint is that the sizing was very confusing. I thought I was buying a pair of size 8 shoe for men or a size 6 for women, but it turned out the other way around. I have tor return these. You need to clarify the sizing of your shoes.
Have not recieved yet.: I ordered this item in Oct. and have not recieved it yet. I purchased this with an extra camera. The camera came in but no monetor.
amorphis continues to change and still continues to be great: i'm a fan of amorphis, from their early stuff to their newer stuff. And i must say that I haven't been dissapitned yet. The production on this cd is amazing, easily their best. It expands on the sound from their last two cds but it adds little more of a metal edge and some even better keyboards. Musically, it's a very diverse cd. It's got metal, folks, electronic, even a little pop I suppose. If your only a fan of early amorphis then you won't like this. If your a fan of their last two releases then you will eat this up.
Get a new singer!: It is a real shame that the singer is so off on this album. It is a really good album musically but vocally, it lacks. The singer has no range and comes off sounding really off key sometimes.....especially track #2. I have been listening to metal for over 10 years now and I know a good album when I hear it. I will try to give this one a few more tries. If you want a good melodic death metal allbum try out Insomnium's newest "Since it all came down".
vocals need work: Amorphis is a band that shined when gutteral vocals were used. This style with their excellent musianship struck a chord in my soul. This album has great guitar work, keyboards, percussion and is generally very well orchestrated. The vocals are poor. It really is upsetting because the first 30 seconds of each song are great and then the singing starts and the song goes to hell. The vocals are frequently sung too high and off key and without any emotion whatsoever. I think this album would have been excellent if the style was of the gutteral growl with some selected clean. The bottom line is Amorphis is very talented, and it is a shame that the vocals make this album mundane.
Worth Adding to Your Collection: My husband had been humming the words to 'Hey Mister' at least a week, so I thought I would check the album out. I decided to purchase it after reading the online reviews. The reviews are right on: this is a great CD but it does try to cover too much ground stylistically.The strongest songs on the CD are the ones that have their own unique flavor. Definitely NOT the ones that reminds you of imitation Cure or Eels take off. However, I'll still listen to the album and love it because what's good is so very, very wickedly good. Even if 'Hey Mister' became popular by being banned, the lyrics are just a riot. 'Beat Me' is good and 'Morning Spank' is best at full volume, anytime.It the whole album could follow those harder lines instead of deviating so much, the album would never leave my CD player.
The Shiznit: This cd is good to listen to it has some bad a** songs like Hey Mister and Morning Spank. The best song on this cd would have to be Morning Spank.
Intense ride: Only heard this album a few months ago but was riveted the first time. The first two tracks are outstanding... Turn it up loud
Hey Mister.... this album rocks!: Heard the single, Hey Mister, on the radio and was curious. Here is a heavy rock song that has beautiful arranging and acoustic guitar, not your average song.... I went out and bought the record first thing tuesday morning and was I pleasantly suprised??!! The album has everything.... the lyrics are smart, interesting and witty.... the songs are well played, arranged and produced and I love the singer's voice! This album has incredible appeal accross the board! I highly reccomend it to anyone who likes any artist from Biggie to Led Zepplin to P.O.D. to the Cure!
Hey Mister... what happened?!: After much anticipation, I bought this cd the day it was released. I loved the song "Hey Mister" on the radio, so I thought that the rest of the cd couldn't be too bad either. Unfortunately I was wrong. Other than the previously mentioned track there is absolutely nothing appealing on this cd. I couldn't name a single track that stuck in my head or that I'd listen to again.I'm not saying the music is terrible because it's not. It's just that every song sounds about the same and doesn't ever grab you like it should. The bottom line is I paid 15.99 on the day of release for one song. Don't make the same mistake.
dude maybe you should quit smoking: I listened to this CD, or I should say I tried to listen to the CD, but I couldn't figure out what was trying to say the words. I thought it might be a man, but I know that can't be because men usually have voices like all other humans. I figure a mad scientist must have re-animated a dead lizard just long enough to record some slop. The music, on the other hand, reminds me of a ...[dis-oriented] Onesidezero who can't figure out what instruments to use or even how to play them. Don't mistake me, Onesidezero is a cool band.
Nautica N12529G Mens: For the price, this is a very good looking watch with good features. The calendar is large and easy to read, the dual time is a great feature and easy to set. The screw in crown makes it watertight, so no worrys when it gets wet. It is a bit thick (13mm), but most watches with these features are. Overall, I am very happy with this watch.
Looks very good: Bought it from Dillards, looks very good and versatile as dress watch or party watch with the more modern crocodile leather design.
A Wealth of Music For A Small Price: Dover publishing has succeeded in printing a very affordable edition of the Bach-Gesellschaft editions of these major Bach works. The only complaint is that the print is rather small, so there's not much room to write in fingering,of which there are none. So this book, by the nature of the music and the lack of fingering, is not for the beginner.That's the only complaint that prevented a five-star rating. Recommended, despite the print size!
Elegant essays: These essays brim over with authorial skill... They are at turns funny, wise, and introspective. They examine the world with a keen eye for detail. Excellent pieces, really. Quite good.
Spartan, uninspired kids rooms: I was very disappointed in this book. There were very few pages dealing with baby's rooms, regardless of the title. This author (a photography stylist...NOT an interior designer) has an apparent fear of color and visual interest. If your tastes run to the highly modern and institutional, you may find some inspiration, but if your interested in anything other than cold, white, spartan surroundings for your child, I'd steer clear of this book. Granted, the photography of these sterile rooms is lovely...but I was not interested in how to stylishly photograph unadorned spaces...I was looking for inspiration to create an imaginative, innovative nursery for my son. I also purchased her other book focused more exclusively on babies...and was even more surprised at her take on the ideal surroundings for babies. They looked like elegant snapshots of an underfunded orphanage. At least I purchased the book used. Keep looking!
Get a recording studio!: I'm not sure what's up with these recordings. I've had three of them now, two from amazon and one from another seller. Why don't these guys do decent sound recordings? They sound like someone went into a bar on friday night and turned on a tape recorder. They are terrible! I own over 1500 cd's and this is by a long shot the worst recording quality i've ever heard. The recordings are tinny and distorted, with tons of midrange, and even some distortion! Whoever made these recordings needs to get an ear! The songs themselves are good if you like Commander Cody. The music is what you would expect from this band.
Auto Ventshade: Chrome hood shield was much nicer than others I looked at.Yes I would recommend this item and AmazonVery good to deal with
rofl: haha too funny image has a sticker that they paid $25 and are selling it here for $40some people just amaze me shakes head
Good but Long: I was surprised at how interesting this book made government. It's not boring like so many other college text books are. There are lots of examples that explain concepts in an interesting way, and there are little side stories about our country's history.Although this book is interesting the chapters are soooo long. I used this book for a 3 week summer government course and the long chapters nearly killed me. I found that I could skip the introduction to each chapter which saved me a whole page of reading. Also, I could sometimes read the first and last paragraph of a section and get the point of the section without having to read all the examples of an issue. The end of the chapter summaries are good, and very usefull to studying for exams.
Democracy Under Pressure.: Felt like the book was taking forever to get here (I waited like a week and a half). Other than that, book is very nice and clean.
taking a line for a walk: 1100 miles on foot, le havre to rome: Having read a couple of other travel sketch books, I had great anticipation for the arrival of Taking a Line for a Walk. I am very disappointed in the tiny format. The sketches are sweet, but I really would like to read the handwritten remarks.
Great Buy!: I bought this book from an Amazon dealer, because I guess it's out of print(?). Anyway, I am currently working in the workbook and it's been right on. If you want to develop a relationship between tarot and your life, then this is the book to get. At first, I didn't know if I could really do all that journaling and I thought about just getting rid of it. I put an ad for it on FreeCycle, and neither one of the people that were interested picked it up. I took that as a sign that I should keep it and I'm glad I did!
help help rescue me from its awful clutches: This is really the worst book I have edver read. I've read a lot of books, & some were really bad, but this is the worst. It's so poorly translated that it makes me horribly depressed every time I try to read it. I haven't finished it yet. Oh man.I did really enjoy the introduction for the historical background information regarding The Song of Roland & the culture surrounding its appearance. But dear lord. Save yourself. Get another translation.If you just want to know what it's about, I'll tell you. Roland & others, for instance Oliver, fight against Pagans in medieval Spain.
The battle between the Caracens and the Franks: Difficult to track the history of this stanza poem, but it is thought to be written in the twelfth century. It is "an epic clash between Christianity and Paganism" (Christians against Muslims, or more precisely, Caracens against Franks). "Based on the massacre in 778 of Charlemagn.......in Northern Spain." There is a lengthy introduction summarizing the story; in it Burgess helps to explain the nuances, history, composition, and the difficulties translating it into straight forward modern English. But Burgess says the main purpose was to make it readable. And he does this with powerful flowing words.The poem is told from both sides, beginning with the pretext to war: "the betrayal". Then the hard fighting begins; it is unforgiving and graphic: "the battle". In the end justice is served: "the trial". You will discover the "Christians" could be evil in their own right, just as the Pagans, by forcing their "religion" on others.Wish you wellScott
Mini Craft Iron: I find that the cord positioned on the left side makes the iron awkward to use. For a right-handed person using the iron backwards is easier. The cord though needed for the amount of current is like having a cricket on the end of a chain often keeping the iron from easily sitting flat. I will continue to use my larger iron.
Safety issue: Lead in the cord: What the description does not tell you, and what you don't find out until you destroy the clamshell packaging to get the iron out (thus eliminating any chance of returning the item!) is this paragraph in the iron's Safety Precautions:CAUTION -- PROP 56 WARNING: Handling the coated electrical wires of this product exposes you to lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause Cancer, birth defects, and other reproductive harm. Wash hands after use.Another problem with this iron: the plate has imperfections. There are extra bits of teflon-like stuff on the surface of the plate, meaning that it is not flat like it should be.
Does the job....barely.: This little iron is does an ok job for what I was looking for - something small to press seams while sewing. It does fine for that, but certainly wouldn't work at getting out any kind of wrinkles.
Don't waste your hard earned money: I do a lot of crafting involving fabric and thought this would be perfect. When it arrived I read all the instructions and became a bit concerned at the use guidelines that suggested it would get very hot And theres no on or off button! Ok, was just prepared to follow guidelines and be gentle with this supposedly hot iron. What happened was the exact opposite! It barely warms up at all! I tried several different fabrics and it barely makes a crease. What a waste. Will look at Walmart for what I need!
Eh: Iron does not heat up hot enough to really iron anything! thought it would be a better product and had plan to take it in bag to sewing class
Too cool: Even heating the bottom of this thing up a bit more with a small torch couldn't hardly make it sustain enough heat to use the iron on denim patch I had.
Cord Won't Stay Attached! :-(: The cord comes out frequently. It's frustrating to be pressing my quilt pieces and have the iron cold without power. I won't buy another one of these. It's a cute size and light to carry, but there are better, less frustrating options on the market than this craft iron.
Barely heats up, for starters: This iron is barely lukewarm, so it is basically useless. Plus, it's dangerous, since you can't stand it up while at rest, and it gets warm enough that it might be able to burn a paper surface. Very bad design, and not worth returning for the $7 you paid.
Not so much: I didn't like this little craft iron. I wanted it to remove wrinkles and open seams on extremely small pieces. But it never seemed to get hot enough for this purpose, despite using a spray bottle to dampen the fabric. (And no, I wasn't saturating the fabric, just lightly misting, like I used to do in the days before a steam iron.) The cord was clumsy, I thought it was because the cord was stiff, but perhaps it was the positioning. I used an ironing mat, which was ridiculously expensive but adequate. I think next I will try the smallest travel iron I can find and a sleeve board.
Great book: I received my book in a timely manner and it was just as the add indicated. Great Condition! I am enjoying the book and I say...why pay $29.95 (new) for a book when you can get it on Amazon.com for $.99 plus shipping. I'll never buy a book new again.
Very good: I found all I wanted to know about menopause and I am very happy to have found it.The only thing I miss in the book is a remark about soya products and how they act negatively on Tiroids, especially if you have hypotiroism how this products block their working.
Warning!: I had to comment, because our magazine, The Pulse of Oriental Medicine, has received several "heads ups" about some advice Christiane gave... she suggested taking the Chinese patent herb remedy "Yunnan Baiyao" before surgery. I and other Chinese Medical experts believe this is an extremely risky idea.#1- Yunnan Baiyao stops bleeding... it affects wound-healing. Herbs of this type can have life-threatening interactions with some drugs.#2- Because of #1, Yunnan Baiyao could alter your response to procedures or drugs, placing your surgeon in an unfamiliar medical landscape, especially if he/she doesn't know you've taken the herbs. Even if they did, not enough is known about how it might interact with the drugs administered before and during surgery.Don't risk it!Christian says that the patent "has been used successfully" in this way. There is no reference or source for this. I have no idea what made her think this was a good idea, and she doesn't tell us.
What about us Non-Unfulfilled Women?: I found this book to be a treatise on Dr. Northrup's personal life. I'm sorry she was unfulfilled till she got her divorce. As I read along, trying as hard as I could to approach it with an open mind, I kept looking for advice for women like me who ARE in partnership, equal, happy marriages, doing what they want with their lives, but yet showing signs of perimenopause.Dr. Northrup found emotional cause for her fibroids, which I have a hard time buying into. I need a book with less hocus-pocus and more hard scientific information, undiluted with the new age approach.
Useful Reading for Menopausal Women: The first few chapters of this book seem to be used to justify/rationalize the author's divorce and to push the practice of mysticism. However, the remainder of the book is full of excellent, practical advice regarding menopause. Dr. Northrup combines traditional medicine with other "medicines" in a nice balance.
Hogwash!: This book has so many stupid ideas, that I can not mention them all.For example.... she suggests that because you might have lived in an unhappy marriage (or situation) you swallowed your words and that is why you have a thyroid problem!!! Ridiculous.She recommends chucking your marriage if you get in menopause and your goals change...I would NOT recommend this book. There were a few parts that seemed to be realistic to me, but it was outweighed by the 'new age' junk.Skip this one!
pseudoscientific nonsense greatly decreases credibility: If she accepts and advocates any and all new age mumbo-jumbo that sounds good, how can I put confidence in her ability to critically filter through all of the research about hormonal therapy, etc.? Just because she cites medical references doesn't mean that they are high-quality studies published in respected medical journals, or that they are studies that are applicable to a wide range of women. And given her level of accepting completely ridiculous things such as "tarot", etc., it is my guess that the scientific advice she gives is just her take on whatever random studies fit with her theories, and probably does not reflect a good grasp of current research. Truly knowledgeable clinicians know how to filter the good from the bad. What could have been a promising book touching on an important topic was undermined by her kooky beliefs.
Tape for Sale - Cheap!: This is a single, relatively short cassette. It is NOT a reading from the book. It was taped while being delivered to a live audience.The doctor's goals to teach and inform were compromised by her needs to 'entertain' and establish rapport with the audience. There are multiple outbursts/interruptions as she elicited responses from the audience. They waste time. The producer did not modulate the volume, and the audience outbursts are often shockingly loud compared to the volume of the vocal presentation. I raised and lowered the volume throughout the tape trying to compensate.Dr. Northrup makes several references to information being presented to the audience via visual aids. That info is lost to those who are listening to the tape. If you have seen Dr. Northrup's presentations on talk shows or PBS you won't gain much if any additional information from this tape. Put your money into the book if you want to learn more. Sandy
Women, don't be fooled!: This books is a load of hype. Northrup is a new-agey. unorthodox practitioner in my humble opinion.I bought it innocently, thinking she would have tons of information regarding menopause and its symptoms and treatments, only to find to my dismay that there is just to much "questionable advice" and unsubstantiated dictates. For example, taking CoEnzyme Q10, which she highly recommends, may be fine after it is proven to be effective for menopausal women in clinical trials, but where is the backup? Where is the proof?I am sorry I spent the money for this book. It is going in the trash, where it belongs.
Warning: Do not buy this book unless you have a very high tolerance for new age gibberish. There is factual information here, but it is buried in gushy self-absorption. I bought it for psychotherapy patients who are going through menopause, but I'd be embarrassed to lend it out.
Worst Amazon experience ever: We were greatly dissapointed with Amazon's customer service. We ordered this book through your web site. Having not received the book we contacted Amazon for support. They referred us to a third party, Z Books. Z Books has the worst customer support that we have experienced in the years that we have dealt on line. This 0 experience was enough to convince us to NEVER use Amazon's service again. We have yet to receive our book, which we paid to recieve, and we have yet to receive any communication from Amazon or Z Book. Please do not send me any more communication.
An Olympian life: Those who seek a captivating 20C journey need look no further. One travels from the author's Canadian roots through academia (OAC, UC Berkeley, Cambridge, Princeton, Harvard), public service (farm policy, the New Deal, the wartime Office of Price Administration, the US Strategic Bombing Survey in Germany and Japan, Indian Ambassadorship), politics (FDR, Truman, Ike, JFK, LBJ, Vietnam opposition, McGovern, Nixon), and influential authorship. Each candid chapter is a pleasure.Galbraith, as always, is consistently sagacious. Like his friend George W. Ball Jr (`The Past Has Another Pattern,' Norton 1982), he's a welcome contrast to subsequent public servants who use their experience to amass personal fortunes by promoting special interests.Highly recommended.
